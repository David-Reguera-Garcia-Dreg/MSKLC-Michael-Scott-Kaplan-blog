<P><EM><FONT size=2>(About 2-5 times a week, I think of a pun that I go down the hall and mention to Judy and Carolyn on the typograhy team. My goal is usually to inspire a scroan, though they are used to it now so I seldom get one these days. But the title of this post is in the spirit of these puns, and dedicated to the fine work they both do when I am not randomizing them this way!)</FONT></EM></P>
<P>If you are one if those few long time readers, you may remember the early 2005 post <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/03/08/389675.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/03/08/389675.html">I coffee, therefore IFilter (or, Language-specific processing #1)</A></STRONG>. </P>
<P>Well, there is a new <A class="" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/deb/default.aspx" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/deb/default.aspx">Filter Central</A> blog being put together by Deb Haldar with its Welcome post <A class="" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/deb/archive/2006/11/08/welcome.aspx" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/deb/archive/2006/11/08/welcome.aspx">right here</A>. </P>
<P>Of the posts I did on IFilter, <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/0001/01/01/395199.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/0001/01/01/395199.html">IWordBreaker</A></STRONG>, and <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/03/13/394822.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/03/13/394822.html">IStemmer</A></STRONG>, I'll admit that the IFilter post got the mopst interest since the largest number of people found it might be applicable to what they wanted to do (there are more people who understand data formats than who understand language issues!). So this may be a great chance to get the answers that a dabbler like me was unable to address....</P>
<P>Ok, the pressure's on now, Deb. Sorry about that, but I am eager to hear more about IFilter too, and mildly eager to perhaps write an implementation for grabbing info in the custom culture files. :-)</P>
<P><EM>(You can also look <A class="" href="http://ifilter.org/" mce_href="http://ifilter.org/">here</A> for more information on IFilter implementations!)</EM></P>

<P>Coming soon to the European Union: Bulgaria and Romania! </P>
<P>These are a couple of important events and have led to updates of the <STRONG><FONT face="times new roman,times" size=4>Times New Roman</FONT></STRONG> and <STRONG><FONT face=arial,helvetica,sans-serif size=4>Arial</FONT></STRONG> fonts in the <A class="" href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=0ec6f335-c3de-44c5-a13d-a1e7cea5ddea&amp;DisplayLang=en" mce_href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=0ec6f335-c3de-44c5-a13d-a1e7cea5ddea&amp;DisplayLang=en">European Union Expansion Font Update</A> (a WGA download).</P>

<P mce_keep="true">Now in the end the primary importance of fonts is in display, so from a cynical view I guess you could be cynical say that this is just for show. Though since it was apparently&nbsp;specifically requested by the Court of Justice in Luxembourg and the European Commission it is obviously not just for show at all. It is considered to be an important gesture of support for the needs of what will be the newest members of the European Union.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">I'll be covering the Romanian characters another day (I have an <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/tags/Every+Character+Has+a+Story/default.aspx" mce_href="../../../../archive/tags/Every+Character+Has+a+Story/default.aspx"><STRONG>Every Character Has a Story</STRONG></A> post about the four Romanian "comma below" characters that&nbsp;I expect&nbsp;will be posted some time this week). It goes into many of the interesting ISO and Unicode and encoding and even keyboard issues that these characters raised. So stay tuned for more on this....</P>
<P mce_keep="true">But&nbsp;the Bulgarian characters&nbsp;have a special place of their own here since it is the first CYRILLIC SCRIPT EU language, and basically&nbsp;one of&nbsp;only two&nbsp;non-LATIN SCRIPT EU languages (the other one is Greek). How the EU works to see this addition through will be interesting&nbsp;(support of Greek in the EU has actually had its share of technical issues over the years).</P>
<P mce_keep="true">Now although these issues are weighed quite heavily, the truth is that&nbsp;all of these six characters <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/01/18/355210.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/01/18/355210.html">have&nbsp;no weight in collation</A></STRONG>, a factoid that affects all versions of Windows prior to Vista, SQL Server, Access/Jet, and so on. A change here to address this&nbsp;would have dire consequences in applications, forcing re-indexing and/or potential index corruption on a global scale. Vista does address this issue, however, which makes Vista the best release to give both Bulgaria and Romania the weight that they of course deserve.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">And along those lines, here is a screenshot of an&nbsp;RTM build of Vista with a huge number of MUI and LIP languages installed:</P>
<P mce_keep="true"><IMG height=795 src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/RomanianAndBulgarian.png" width=508>&nbsp;</P>
<P mce_keep="true">Note the language selected at the top of the list and also the language highlighted farther down....</P>
<P mce_keep="true">I suppose if one was feeling ornery enough one could argue that UI language is just for show, too. But obviously it is more than that -- it is a commitment to the native speakers of a language in the concrete desire to give people a better "local" experience. :-)</P>

<p>Here is the place where I want to remind you the following Bulgarian language related posts and comments:</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/09/12/463483.html#467936">http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/archive/2005/09/12/463483.aspx#467936</a></p>

<p>or see</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgarian_language#Word_stress">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgarian_language#Word_stress</a></p>
<p>Basically I want to say again that the Bulgarian written language uses 8 Stressed vowels with grave accent or when we take into consideration the letter case - lowercase and UPPERCASE - so we have 16 Stressed vowels with grave accent!</p>
<p>So, the:</p>
<p>U+040d &nbsp; &nbsp;Ѝ &nbsp; &nbsp;CYRILLIC CAPITAL LETTER I WITH GRAVE</p>
<p>U+045d &nbsp; &nbsp;ѝ &nbsp; &nbsp;CYRILLIC SMALL LETTER I WITH GRAVE</p>
<p>are only 2 (two) of these 16 Stressed vowels with grave accent !!!</p>
<p>I can suggest for future Font Updates to contact the The Institute for the Bulgarian Language at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences as the Official regulatory body of Bulgarian language and especially The Department of Computational Linguistics as part of the Institute of the Bulgarian Language at <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://dcl.bas.bg/">http://dcl.bas.bg/</a> nevertheless the requests made by the Court of Justice in Luxembourg and the European Commission because of miss coordination between European Commission and The Institute for the Bulgarian Language.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Ivan.</p></div>

<p>Thank you for the response.</p>
<p>I think you do not understood me correctly!</p>
<p>With the above comment I mean that in future Microsoft Font Updates it will be good to be made the Times New Roman and Arial fonts to display the rest of the Bulgarian Stressed vowels with grave accent correctly, as you say:</p>
<p>1) &quot;the primary importance of fonts is in display&quot; (this post);</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>2) &quot;These characters already exist in Unicode, in the composite (decomposed) form. Note that they look better in some fonts than they do in others -- which is mainly a matter of letting font foundries that work to support languages know that there is a need to make sure these particular characters have good font hints so that they will not look good &quot;by accident&quot; of the combining character guessing how best to work with the base characters&quot; (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/02/06/367985.html">http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/archive/2005/02/06/367985.aspx</a>).</p>
<p>So this is my point of view. I've understood you clearly and do not insist everything else than better representation of this characters in future Font updates.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Ivan.</p></div>

Yes, this is a reasonable request, getting the display of these composite characters to be a little better. Though the improved display may not be as high of a priority in updating the font on downlevel systems as what led to this particular update (characters that were entirely missing), of course....</P></div>

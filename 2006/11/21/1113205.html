<P>So, it's now over and tomorrow I am flying back to Redmond. The talks were done last Thursday at <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/10/04/788747.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/10/04/788747.html">IUC #30</A></STRONG> and I even posted about some of the exciting things I mentioned in the <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/11/17/1097666.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/11/17/1097666.html">keyboard presentation</A></STRONG>.</P>
<P>But interestingly, of the two:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>Keyboards on Win32: Beyond the Keyboard Layout Creator </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Sorting It All Out: More Words on Collation</STRONG></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The keyboard presentation was&nbsp;not my favorite; the one I enjoyed most was the sorting talk. :-)</P>
<P>Just before the talk someone asked me what I would be covering and whether it was advanced or not; I told her she might leave happy.</P>
<P>The presentation&nbsp;was actually an experiment for me, and not something I had ever really fully done before. My intro that I did before starting the presentation proper (these are not even close to the&nbsp;exact words I used but its what I practiced so I believe I said something like this -- attendees should feel free to&nbsp;confirm or refute this!):</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>I'll admit that is not a typical talk for me. In years past I'd&nbsp;do presentations with Cathy Wissink that would sound really freaking boring [<EM>I had to pause for the laughs here</EM>] but we'd announce exciting releases, like for Microsoft Layer for Unicode or Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator. I think people started realizing that the more boring the talk sounded, the more reason they had to attend. [<EM>More laughs</EM>]</P>
<P>Anyway, today I am not doing any of that. In fact, I will probably talk more about stuff that we did not end up doing, or shipping in Vista, including some stuff we might have really&nbsp;wanted to. [more laughs]</P>
<P>In prior years some people would feel the talk was too basic, and others would feel that it was too advanced. I don't know what to do with that [more laughs!] but this time I decided I would start with some really basic stuff and then move into stuff that is very advanced, intentionally. My goal is to make sure that nobody leaves happy. [more laughter!]</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P mce_keep="true">Anyway, then I launched in and did the presentation. I was really "on" that afternoon, and sure I'll look at the&nbsp;feedback later but I had a whole bunch of people (including the&nbsp;person who talked to me before the talk) come up and tell me they loved it. So maybe I should do more of that!</P>
<P mce_keep="true">Anyway, after I get back I'll be talking a lot about TableDrivenTIP stuff, including Vista versions of all of the prior samples I posted. I just wanted to pause and mention to those of you who enjoyed&nbsp;listening to that second presentation&nbsp;that I enjoyed doing it, tremedously....</P>

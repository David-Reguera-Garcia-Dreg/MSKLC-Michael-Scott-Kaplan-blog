<P>Okay, some upcoming [restricted and non-restricted access] talks for people who enjoy my blather here and want to see if it is as much fun in person!</P>
<P>Thursday, November 2nd (2:30pm-4:00pm PT) -- for Microsoft MVPs only!<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <STRONG>Vista Internationalization Update</STRONG>, a webcast that all Microsoft MVPs can check out by looking at the <A class="" href="https://mvp.support.microsoft.com/event/" mce_href="https://mvp.support.microsoft.com/event/ ">MVP Event Calendar</A> (secure site, MVPs only)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (there is a plan to do additional webcasts for other areas of the world at better times, but I do not have dates yet)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (if you aren't an MVP, the link will actually take you to information about the program; if you are one, then the webcast&nbsp;will be&nbsp;recorded for later viewing)</P>
<P>Thursday, November 16th (11:30am-12:20pm ET) -- at the <A class="" href="http://www.unicodeconference.org/conference-at-a-glance.htm" mce_href="http://www.unicodeconference.org/conference-at-a-glance.htm">30th Internationalization and Unicode Conference in Washington D.C</A>.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <STRONG><A class="" href="http://www.unicodeconference.org/program-d.htm#Kaplan-Thur" mce_href="http://www.unicodeconference.org/program-d.htm#Kaplan-Thur">Keyboards on Win32: Beyond the Keyboard Layout Creator</A></STRONG> -- I won't be able to tell all, but I will be able to say plenty. :-)</P>
<P>Thursday, November 16th (5:00pm-5:30pm ET) -- at the <A class="" href="http://www.unicodeconference.org/conference-at-a-glance.htm" mce_href="http://www.unicodeconference.org/conference-at-a-glance.htm">30th Internationalization and Unicode Conference in Washington D.C</A>.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <STRONG><A class="" href="http://www.unicodeconference.org/program-d.htm#Kaplan-Thur-2" mce_href="http://www.unicodeconference.org/program-d.htm#Kaplan-Thur-2">Sorting It All Out: More Words on Collation</A></STRONG> -- all new words, many of which focus on Vista and others on interesting linguistic issues!</P>
<P>I'll also be doing some booth time&nbsp;while I'm there, so walk up and introduce yourself if you're there!</P>
<P>Friday, December 1st (11:35am-1:00pm PT) -- for Microsoft Full Time Employees only!<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <STRONG>Windows Architecture Changes for Custom Locales</STRONG> -- watch the [MS internal] <A class="" href="http://developer/" mce_href="http://developer/">Developer</A> site for room info (Steptoe or Olympic)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (this is the talk rescheduled from last week and will actually be several weeks cooler due to some&nbsp;interesting&nbsp;questions I have gotten)</P>
<P>Of course if you aren't a Microsoft employee or a Microsoft MVP or in Washington, D.C. for the Unicode Conference, you can still find me here every day talking about whatever comes to mind....</P>
<P>Enjoy!</P></FONT>

<p>The MVP thing is listed as 3 to 4 pm.</p>
<p>I would hate to miss the first 30 minutes.</p></div>
<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 1 Nov 2006 4:34 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>With my luck, the 2:30 time will have been someone giving me a half hour to set up, and so at 3pm I'll have a bunch of surly people who have been waiting 30 minutes for the webcast to start! :-)</p>

<p>There are many many people who have been unhappy about the bug I mentioned in <strong><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/06/27/648618.html">Keyboards under LUA</a></strong>, and not everyone wants to wait until the end of January for <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/11/17/1097666.html"><strong>MSKLC 1.4</strong></a>, so I figured I would post the workaround to this problem so everyone would have it. :-)</p>
<p>Obviously one workaround is to use the <strong>Run as administrator</strong> console as I pointed out in that <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/06/27/648618.html"><strong>Keyboards under LUA</strong></a> post. But for those who would rather be able to just double click on the .MSI file, here is the workaround....</p>
<p>First, you have to install Orca (you can get a copy from <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/astebner/archive/2004/07/12/180792.aspx">Aaron Stebner's blog</a> if you don't want to download the whole Platform SDK).</p>
<p>Then, right click on the install package and choose the Edit with Orca option:</p>
<p> <img src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/ScrewLua01.png"></p>
<p>After that, select the CustomAction table on the left. You should see three items in the table:</p>
<p> <img src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/ScrewLua02.png"></p>
<p>That second column is the <strong>Type</strong> column. If you take those last two entries and change them from <strong>1</strong> to <strong>3073</strong> then save and exit.</p>
<p><img src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/ScrewLua03.png"></p>
<p>Now if you double click on your .MSI file, you will still be prompted to elevate just as the <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/06/27/648618.html"><strong>Keyboards under LUA</strong></a> post mentions, but once you elevate, everything will work and the keyboard layout will install.</p>
<p><img src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/ScrewLua04.png"></p>
<p>Of course the update for MSKLC will do all this for you.</p>
<p>But a lot of people have been complaining about this particular issue not for themselves but for users they give the packages to. So I figure posting this information might really help some people out. :-)</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

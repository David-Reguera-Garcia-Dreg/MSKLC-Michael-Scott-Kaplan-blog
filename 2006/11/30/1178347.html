<p>It's generally easier to reference languages/locales/etc... by rfc-3066 style identifiers (iso-3166/iso-639 pairs) as those lists are very complete and appear to be updated frequently.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most Windows software (including some which I'm currently working on) uses LCIDs to identify languages. So, if I (or the users of the software I'm working on) need to work with a language that doesn't have an LCID, I need to make one up. Which is clearly going to cause trouble at some point down the line. :(</p>
<p>Do you know if MS have some plans to define LCIDs for languages they don't actually support? Just put them in a &quot;reserved&quot; category or something? Or are you only going to define LCIDs as they become supported?</p></div>

<p>Micrsosoft is moving away from LCIDs and towards the RFC names (using the update to 3066). LCIDs have their days numbered....</p>

<p><a id="1178606" href="#1178606">#</a> <strong>ReallyEvilCanine</strong> on 30 Nov 2006 11:03 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Lemme guess. There's as much a chance of this being back-ported to earlier systems as there is of back-ported Unicode support for Win3.11, right?</p>
<p>I'll definitely be giving this it a try. Maybe I can Tom Sawyer a few of my cow-orkers into doing the legwork so I can build special German locales like Platt and Bavarian.</p>
<p>Of course, as soon as customers get used to this availability they're going to demand it of us, too, and our I18N team is &lt;i&gt;still&lt;/i&gt; fighting with Eng because there are &lt;i&gt;still&lt;/i&gt; hard-coded strings in DLLs.</p></div>
<p><a id="1178620" href="#1178620">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 30 Nov 2006 11:14 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>For managed applications, the support will actually work, all you need is for it to be a 2.0 app.</p>
<p>For unmanaged apps, the backport is highly unlikely. It took an amazing effort to get that support in, and there is no wayto mask that as a bug fix; it is new functionality, which is a hard sell for a service pack....</p>

<p><a id="1178903" href="#1178903">#</a> <strong>Adam</strong> on 30 Nov 2006 12:50 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>LCIDs might have their days numbered, but that doesn't help me supporting the ad-hoc private ones in an unmanaged legacy app. :(</p>
<p>(But it's not your job to help me with mine, so ignore me, I'm just moaning :)</p>
<p>However, is there an official page somewhere that mentions the deprecation of LCIDs for .NET 2.0+? I could use the ammo to bolster my case for getting us to move towards rfc-3066 locale identifiers for future development. The old hats have been using LCIDs for years, are used to them, don't want to take the perf/bloat hit (ints are generally quicker and smaller as database keys than strings) of real names, are more numerous, and generally have more weight in discussions than me...</p></div>
<p><a id="1179164" href="#1179164">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 30 Nov 2006 2:08 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Well, the fact that custom cultures do not work with LCIDs is a pretty compelling issue. </p>
<p>I don't know about &quot;official sites&quot; beyond the fact that new features are only being put on the name-based Win32 NLS API functions and such, does that count?</p>

<P>So on Tuesday, <A class="" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/default.aspx" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/default.aspx">Eric Lippert</A> posted about how <A class="" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/archive/2006/11/28/every-number-is-special-in-it-s-own-special-way.aspx" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/archive/2006/11/28/every-number-is-special-in-it-s-own-special-way.aspx">Every Number Is Special In Its Own Special Way</A>.</P>
<P>Now everyone over there geeked out about proving that all numbers are special, as one might expect.</P>
<P>But as soon as I saw the title, I knew what popped in my head -- <STRONG><FONT size=4>Three is a magic number!</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>Just as I learned it on <A class="" href="http://www.school-house-rock.com/3.html" mce_href="http://www.school-house-rock.com/3.html">Schoolhouse Rock</A>!</P>
<P mce_keep="true">I couldn't find the original online but I found the Blind Melon cover of it <A class="" href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=7VDpVE6GMc4" mce_href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=7VDpVE6GMc4">here</A> on YouTube, and Everything<FONT size=1><SUB>2</SUB></FONT> has the lyrics <A class="" href="http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=456583" mce_href="http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=456583">here</A>, plus some fun info from Bob Dorough (the author) who wrote it the way I write some blog posts (first the title, then try to fill in the post that goes with that title!).</P>
<P mce_keep="true">Ignoring the possible semantic/pragmatic differences between "<EM>magic</EM>" numbers and "<EM>special</EM>" numbers, it seems like a reasonable leap of logic to me!</P>
<P mce_keep="true"><EM>(As a side note, the number <A class="" href="http://www.school-house-rock.com/8.html" mce_href="http://www.school-house-rock.com/8.html">eight</A> (8) is also quite special given the common association with infinity (âˆž), due to the code page best-fit mapping most commonly attributed to Cathy Wissink, by everyone except for her!)</EM></P>
<P mce_keep="true"><FONT color=#ff00ff><EM>This post brought to you by</EM>&nbsp;<FONT size=6>3</FONT> <EM>(<A class="" href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0033" mce_href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0033">U+0033</A>, a.k.a. DIGIT THREE, a magic number!)</EM></FONT></P></FONT>

<p>Alas, the lowest &quot;magic number&quot;, mathematically speaking, is 15; the next lowest is 34, which was used by Durer in a famous engraving from 1514; which Sam Loyd used as the inspiration for his infamous 15/14 puzzle; and to complete the circle, Martin Gardner edited a book &quot;Mathematical puzzles of Sam Loyd.&quot;</p>
<p>Speaking of covers of &quot;Three is a Magic Number&quot;, the recent Jack Johnson CD &quot;Curious George&quot; contains a song &quot;Reduce, Reuse, Recycle&quot; which seems to borrow somewhat heavily from &quot;Three is a Magic Number.&quot; &nbsp;But I guess it's hard to trademark mathematical facts.</p>

<P>I asked Shawn if he could include the Valley Girl locale in his collection of <A class="" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/shawnste/archive/2006/11/07/some-custom-locale-examples.aspx" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/shawnste/archive/2006/11/07/some-custom-locale-examples.aspx">some custom locale samples</A>. And he did, you can check it out. :-)</P>
<P>The origin of this locale and its hilarious underlying data predates custom locales and custom cultures; it was originally something that Cathy and I joked about doing to Julie's machine one day if she left her workstation unlocked. It would have been done the old way, as a private version of the locale data that would never ship but one day she'd notice. </P>
<P>Kind of like when we threatened to write her bio once on the team page if she didn't do it herself. When I finally did it (I took a Julia Roberts bio and replaced the Julia references to Julie and then forgot about it until several months later I mentioned it an offhand way and she realized finally who did it (she had noticed it ages ago).</P>
<P>Now we never did the full valley girl locale though we had mentioned it to Julie and she was kind of looking for us to do it some day. However,&nbsp;the notion of sneaking it on her machine&nbsp;remained something of a "thought prank" until one day, when I was talking to Shawn about his Klingon locales and he mentioned wanting to have some more samples, so I&nbsp;mentioned that Julie had been kinda hoping for this one. So he went ahead and did it....</P>
<P>&nbsp;It was freaking hilarious, and Julie liked it too. When I was showing it off at the MVP webcast I was actually asked if Klingon and Valley Girl were going to ship with Vista.:-)</P>
<P>Well, they aren't. But anyone can grab&nbsp;them from the link off of Shawn's&nbsp;post and like totally enjoy them, fer shur!</P>

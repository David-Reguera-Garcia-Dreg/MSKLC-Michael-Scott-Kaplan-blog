<P><FONT face=Tahoma>You may have thought it was over. I mean, at some point there was a break after there was <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/02/03/524139.html"><STRONG>We're drowning in LIPs!</STRONG></A>, <STRONG><A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/02/10/370460.html">Microsoft, you giving us some LIP?</A></STRONG>, <STRONG><A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/10/14/481095.html">Let there be LIPs</A></STRONG>, <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/11/30/498186.html"><STRONG>Oops, we did it again</STRONG></A>, <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/03/16/552695.html"><STRONG>Oh Kannada... (ಕನ್ನಡ)</STRONG></A>, and <STRONG><A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/04/06/569669.html">'c' is for click sounds, and they're good enough for me</A></STRONG>.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But how long could that really last? :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Yes, now released is the <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=0DB2E8F9-79C4-4625-A07A-0CC1B341BE7C&amp;displaylang=fa">Persian Language Interface Pack</A>!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Here is some background info about Persian....</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2><STRONG>Number of speakers</STRONG>: ~70 million native speakers, ~40 second language speakers.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2><STRONG>Name in the language itself</STRONG>:&nbsp; فارسی (transliterated as “Farsi”) </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>Persian, dating back in its development to the great Persian Empire of the 6th century BC, is the most important Indo-European language in Southwestern Asia. It has several dialects; three of them are spoken by the majority of Persian speakers: 40 million people speak Western Persian, also known as Farsi, the national language of Iran, 15 million Tajik, national language of Tajikistan, and 15 million use Eastern Persian or Dari, which is one of the national languages of Afghanistan. Additionally Persian is spoken by around 40 to 50 million speakers as a second language.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>The language name has become a confusing issue: Not only are Dari and Tadjik often considered to be different languages by many non-linguists because of their names, but also is the native name “Farsi” now increasingly used for “Persian”. This is like calling Spanish “Español” in English, though.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2><STRONG>Fun facts</STRONG>:</FONT></P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>There are several Persian loanwords in English, like caravan, caviar, divan, jackal, magic, musk, tulip and turban (which both stem from the same Persian word). The word chess is derived from the Persian word for king, shah, while the chess term checkmate comes from “shâh mât” (="the king is left helpless / the King cannot escape", not, as often said, “the king is dead”).</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>Persian was widely used in India as an administrative language until it was replaced by English with the British colonial rule.</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>The most important work of Persian literature, the Shahnameh (Book of Kings) was written by the poet Abû l-Qâsem-e Ferdousî a.k.a. Ferdowsi around the year 1000 AD and is a true epic: It is seven times as long as Homer’s Iliad.</FONT></LI></UL>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2><STRONG>Classification </STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>Persian is an Indo-European language and belongs to the Indo-Iranian languages.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2><STRONG>Script</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>With the exception of Tajik, which is written in Cyrillic, all Persian dialects are using the Arabic script, with four additional letters (پ, چ, ژ, گ), two modified letters (ک, ی) and a few variations on spelling. This Persian alphabet is itself further extended when being used for languages like Urdu or Pashto.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

I know Cyrillic was fairly recent (18th century) and I Tajik is quite old (6th century BC)</div>
<p><a id="602257" href="#602257">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on Friday, May 19, 2006 8:02 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Some of the oldest Cyrillic manuscripts date back to the 9th century -- way before the 18th!).</div>
<p><a id="603025" href="#603025">#</a> <strong>Gabe</strong> on Sunday, May 21, 2006 1:54 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">St. Cyril, for whom Cyrillic is named, lived from 827 to 869, so the alphabet is about a thousand years older than you thought Gene. However, it is believed that Cyril made contributions to an alphabet that was even older than that.<br><br>Tajik, as you would expect, was originally an Arabic-scripted language, up until 1928, when they switched to Latin. In 1940 they changed to Cyrillic because the Soviets wanted everything uniform. With the breakup of the Soviet Union, they started the attempt to go back to Latin in 1994. Thus, there are people who would know how to read Tajik in 3 different scripts, but most speakers probably learned it in Cyrillic.</div>

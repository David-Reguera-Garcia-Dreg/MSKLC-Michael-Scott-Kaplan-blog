<P><FONT face=Tahoma><EM>(Feeling a little philosophical on a Sunday afternoon; feel free to disregard as needed!)</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>That fun line from The West Wing that we'll never hear Martin Sheen say again and have it mean quite the same thing as when a PotUS with a million things on the schedule that day says it to mean -- <EM>time to move to the next item on the list</EM>.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So I think about all of the things I have accomplished and the projects I have worked on. And about how Vista is really complete from the NLS point of view, with all that is left is looking at bugs and triaging them and fixing them p.r.n.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Of course for the future there are plenty of interesting features, and interesting challenges, right here. But there is also a very wide world of other areas, places where internationalization support has issues that are just as important or maybe even moreso. Places where the customer impact is perhaps even greater. Places where knowledge, or a blog post (or 50 blog posts!) could make a real difference.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And in the more quiet moments,&nbsp;<FONT face=Tahoma>it is hard not to have one of those Jed Bartlett moments and not say "<STRONG>What's Next?</STRONG>"</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>To be honest, I have no idea (the downside of feeling philosophical is that like philosophy in general it seldom provides answers; it simply provides better context for the questions!).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But it is in quiet moments that one hears the question loudest that one realizes that the question is always there; it is only in the quiet moments that it is not drowned out....</P></FONT>

The limonata was sent by someone as a thank you since they were going to be interviewing at Microsoft, and I had helped out there a bit.<br><br>But I like the way you think -- anyone who was thinking I might be interested in what they were doing could do worse than a case of limonata to get my attention! :-)</div>

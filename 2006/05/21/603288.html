<P><FONT face=Tahoma>You know the old joke about getting dunning letters about owing <STRONG>$0.00</STRONG> and in order to placate the dunners needing to send a check for <STRONG>$0.00</STRONG>?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I thought it was an urban legend.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But something hauntingly familar to that has been happening to me&nbsp;over the last few years from <A href="http://www.pse.com/">Puget Sound Energy</A>.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>You see, for as long as I have been getting bills from utilities, I have&nbsp;almost always&nbsp;overpayed them, since having to write checks for really small amounts&nbsp;every&nbsp;month is just annoying, especiaslly if you are travelling a lot. So when I moved to email notifications and online bill paying, I kept doing the same.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But when I am sent bill reminders for most months, it lists a due date that is coming up and an amount due of <STRONG>$0.00</STRONG>.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And if I look at my account online, it has many notes about past bills that are due, each one in that same amount of <STRONG>$0.00</STRONG>.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>(all of the months that I actually made a payment have had the entries removed, so it is just a huge list of these no-money-due entries.)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>When I finally got sick of these entries and wanted to remove them, I tried to pay them with payment entries of <STRONG>$0.00</STRONG>.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Unfortunately, the payment center was a bit smarter than that and does not allow me to pay such an amount (too bad the billing center is not that smart!).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And it is also unfortunate that I cannot simply pay <STRONG>$0.01</STRONG> for each, as this super-smart payment&nbsp;center is suspicious of attempts to pay with identical amounts, assuming it must be a mistake on my part (again, too bad that the billing center is not that smart since it had no problem billing me with identical amounts, and also it is really too bad that the payment center cannot take the trouble to look at the identical amounts, either!).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So, about every 6-8 months or so, I pay off each of these <STRONG>$0.00</STRONG> entries with amounts from <STRONG>$0.01</STRONG> to <STRONG>$0.08</STRONG> and that clears out all of the old entries.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And it stands to me as proof that computerizing still has a bit of a ways to go (and makes me realize that not all 'improvements' over an old system sending dunning letters for <STRONG>$0.00</STRONG> actually represent progress!)</FONT></P>

I've gotten bills from<br>credit cards for amounts past due $00.00 with finance charge<br>of $00.00, each time they send one of those it costs them<br>postage. Try sending the bill back in the pre-paid envelope,<br>mabe a person will open it...those people are paid to do that<br>plus benifits. Try one of those TV judges?<br>Nice country where you're at; you can see Mt. Ranier?<br>I live in Chicago, very nice here too. No earthquakes, slides or<br>brush fires. Many years ago, I served in Viet Nam and passed<br>through Ft. Lewis.</div>

The most typical example was the 1-1.1 operation, which would lead to a long number sequence approximating the expected result, -0.1, such as -0.095645564564564.... One of the most joked about calculation is 3.11-3.1, results in 0.00. This leads to the joke &quot;Q: What is the difference between 3.11 and 3.1? A: Nothing!&quot; (In this case, &quot;3.11&quot; and &quot;3.1&quot; imply the version numbers of Windows.)” &nbsp;(<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Calculator">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Calculator</a>)</div>

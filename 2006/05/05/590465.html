<P><FONT face=Tahoma>You shouldn't feel bad if you have never heard of Access .MDX files. I mean, they were never actually a part of any product with that name, after all.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Let's scan back a bit, to Access 95. I was an external then -- not even contracting for Microsoft, and not yet an MVP.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>There was a bit of a stir among the&nbsp;Beta testers&nbsp;about the fact that the Access wizard files were in some type of locked form that did not allow you to look at the code or the form/report design surfaces. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Why the stir? Well, the usual reason. The fact that none of us knew how it was done. The way you can tell that some of the people who use Access really are developers at heart is the way they want every feature that exists to (1) be exposed and (2) be exposed programatically. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Shortly thereafter (some time after Access 97 Beta 1), I found myself in Redmond working on a contract for the MS Certification folks, and David Lazar asked me if I was interested in doing a little wizard work for the recently shipped Access 95 for DAD (Desktop Applications Division) Marketing. So I found myself temporarily on the Access team....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I noticed when I installed debug daily builds of Access (which I was doing most days,&nbsp;after I found that the rest of the development team was doing it and I wanted to fit in!) that there was a function exported in the debug version of msaccess.exe that was not in the retail version. I didn't have access to source at that point, so in the same spirit that I used to reverse engineer the <A href="http://www.mvps.org/access/api/api0031.htm">AddressOf&nbsp;functionality in Access 97</A>, I figured how to call it and what it did. It created what was then called .MDX files --&nbsp;the eXecutable versions of .MDB files that were in Access 97 renamed to .MDE files).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Now&nbsp;I feel obliged to point out that I was doing all this on my own time,&nbsp;<STRONG>unpaid</STRONG>, and the only real use I ever got out of doing it was several months later, when Drew suggested that we should run FDeliverDb on the Access 95 Publish to Web Wizard and that he would show me how to do it since it was pretty quirky in Access 95. He was in shock when&nbsp;I got to tell him I already knew how it worked (it may have led to my first actual wizard contract, as opposed to this one that the marketing folks were paying for!).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I must truly be a geek since</FONT></P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>getting it to work at all even though I could never use it was to me like I was paid for the time it took to figure it out;</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>being able to make productive use of what I learned was like being paid a&nbsp;bonus;</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>being able to shock Drew was priceless!</FONT></LI></UL>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I am not sure whether the name change from the internally known .MDX files of&nbsp;Access 95&nbsp;to the documented .MDE files of Access 97 was done by Program Management or Marketing. But the idea of the files being thought of as <STRONG>Microsoft Access Executables</STRONG> was a name that did not stick -- in documentation they are just thought of as "Microsoft Access MDE Databases". Although the name is the original inspiration for both the old extension and the new ones, it is odd an interesting way.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>You see, in many cases an acronym becomes a word and then many people no longer know what the acronym stands for -- LASER is a good example (it stands for Light Amplification by the Stimulated Emission of Radiation, though most people&nbsp; no longer seem to know this).&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Anyway, the official name of the files is actually kind of cool since .MDE is an acronym that was never defined in public as such a thing -- it simply became a word, even though all offthe other analagous Access file extensions (.MDB, .MDA, .MDW) had known, historical origins as acronyms.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I asked Kieran if there was an official term for the phenomenon regarding acronyms becoming de facto words,&nbsp;but she wasn't sure there was one. And a quick perusal of <A href="http://www.languagelog.com/">Language Log</A> did not find clues regarding either the general phenomenon or the lack of it in this particular (.MDE) case. We may need to get the folks over at Language Log Plaza involved! :-)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The Internet Extensions for Win32, a.k.a. WinINet.dll, has been around for a long time.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Does it support Unicode? <STRONG>Yes, it does</STRONG> -- a bunch of "W" functions, though many of them seem to convert the strings from Unicode.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Does it support Unicode on Win9x? <STRONG>No, it does not</STRONG> (as far as I know).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Does MSLU (the Microsoft Layer for Unicode on Win9x Systems) support the functions in it? <STRONG>No, it does not</STRONG></FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So imagine my surprise when I noticed the following text in the help topic in the Platform SDK for <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/wininet/wininet/ftpputfile.asp">FtpPutFile</A>&nbsp;(similar text in&nbsp;most of the <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/wininet/wininet/wininet_functions.asp">other WinINet functions</A>):</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>Implemented as <B>FtpPutFileW</B> (Unicode) and <B>FtpPutFileA</B> (ANSI). Note that Unicode support on Windows Me/98/95 requires Microsoft Layer for Unicode.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So just to dispell any&nbsp;lurking rumors, MSLU support has not been expanded to WinINet.dll and there are no plans for such an expansion.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I mean, after all, even <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/support/endofsupport.mspx">extended support for Windows 98 and Windows Me</A> ends on July 11th of this year!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I'll mention this to the SDK folks, hopefully this post will be obsolete soon enough....</FONT></P>

Kaplan</strong> on 19 May 2006 1:58 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Hi Joel,<br><br>I've been thinking about it, and I am pretty sure it is worse that cut and paste, since the Win32 API function topics where an MSLU link is appropriate actually link to the MSLU topics -- which the copy/paste would have picked up!<br><br>This seems more like someone trying to answer the &quot;Unicode&quot; question for these functions and not knowing what to put, so looking at other topics for answers. Luckily, not being sure they are right, they did not add the link?<br><br>This is all theorizing though, the science of forensic documentation review is a relatively new field. :-)</div>

<p>Which might mean that it already supports Win9x without MSLU anyway.</p>

<p><strong>Yuhong Bao</strong> on 4 Sep 2010 4:39 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>I disassembled it in IDA Pro and there is also some A wrappers that convert and call the W version in wininet too, even on Win9x. In any case, all this means that the W functions in wininet.dll are already available on Win9x without MSLU, at least the IE 6 SP1 version!</p>

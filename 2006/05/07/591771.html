<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So on Friday night I was out at Caffe Bella, at the show I mentioned <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/04/23/581531.html">previously</A>. It is always good to get out, especially after a week that did not go&nbsp; exactly the way you wanted it to like last one....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Playing in the round were <A href="http://kristinconnell.com/default.asp">Kristin Connell</A>, <A href="http://www.drewdundon.com/">Drew Dundon</A>, and Jace Krause of <A href="http://www.fridaymile.com/">Friday Mile</A>, with a few extras (like the charming Hannah Williams in the audience singing a bit with Jace and the amazing <A href="http://www.smithdaddy.com/">Ryan Smith</A> showing up to help out Kristin with the final song).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>During and after, Kristin and I had talked about good shows to see (after she missed <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/04/19/578767.html">Beth Orton</A>&nbsp;last month!).&nbsp;Candidates at the moment are <A href="http://www.myspace.com/fionaapple">Fiona Apple</A> (who will be at Chateau Ste. Michelle in Woodinville on July 3rd) and <A href="http://www.droge.com/">Pete Droge</A> (who it looks like will be at the Tractor on August 17th for a CD&nbsp;release show), plus whatever other artists may be in the area in the meantime (I missed her playing with the&nbsp;wonderful <A href="http://www.rachelharrington.net/">Rachel Harrington</A> last night, but Rachel is someone else I'd love to see/hear again, as well as the delightful&nbsp;<A href="http://www.hollyfigueroa.com/">Holly Figueroa</A> -- who I hope will be feeling better soon!).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Anyway, the show on Friday was awesome,&nbsp;enough to make sure that&nbsp;I scooted up after to buy a Friday Mile CD from Jace (he threw in a CD from his old band <A href="http://www.myspace.com/theglassfamily">The Glass Family</A>, too,&nbsp;no charge&nbsp;-- a cool name for a band though I wonder if everyone who listened to them knows of the Salinger reference!).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><EM>Someone&nbsp;made a comment about how great it was that I was supporting local artists, but I pointed out that that is coincidental -- I wouldn't be supporting any artist if I did not enjoy their music!</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Afterward I was talking with Drew, who offered to help me find some good music the next time I made it back to Ireland -- definitely something I will keep in mind. As I pointed out to him (and as others have pointed out to me!), the fact is that&nbsp;my&nbsp;interactions with&nbsp;musicians&nbsp;are almost the only thing that makes me even remotely interesting to those who are not hopelessly geeky. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>In any case, it was a great show and I would highly recommend all four (including Ryan)&nbsp;of the singer/songwriter types from the show if you have the opportunity to see them.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And of course to always support local artists who are good....</FONT></P>

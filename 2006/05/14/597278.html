<P><FONT face=Tahoma>This post is telling a true story.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Not only is it true, but it has been true five different times (with minor, inconsequential variations each time with different people).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It is fair to say that I am hopeful that by posting it that there will not be a sixth time....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Anyway, it went something like this. Someone sent me an email, asking about the .NET Framework's JapaneseCalendar. He had experimentally determined the boundaries for the different eras:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And as part of his test cases, he needed to know what to fill in for that last date.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>In fairness to him and all of the others, none of them are from Japan. They are simply&nbsp;developers/testers using Microsoft products, and they all had in common the fact that they did not look at the help topic....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>As gently as I could, I pointed him to that MSDN topic that describes the <A href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.globalization.japanesecalendar.aspx">JapaneseCalendar class</A>, and the similar table that it presents:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And of course the important text in the Remarks section:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>The Japanese calendar, which is also known as the Wareki calendar, works exactly like the Gregorian calendar, except that the year and era are different.<BR><BR><FONT color=#ff0000><STRONG>The Japanese calendar recognizes one era for every emperor's reign.</STRONG></FONT> The current era is the Heisei era, which began in the Gregorian calendar year 1989. The era name is typically displayed before the year. For example, the Gregorian calendar year 2001 is the Japanese calendar year Heisei 13. Note that the first year of an era is called "Gannen"; therefore, the Gregorian calendar year 1989 was the Japanese calendar year Heisei Gannen.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>(the red emphasis is mine)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It would most definitely be a bad thing if Microsoft (or any company for that matter!) had knowledge of the end of the emperor's reign, and&nbsp;am sure that I am only one of many who would never wish for such knowledge to be in anyone's hands.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The expression from&nbsp;my heritage would be something along the lines of "may he live to be 120" but I would honestly not even want to say that, as it feels ill omened to set any kind of limit here, and I think that what the <A href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.globalization.japanesecalendar.aspx">JapaneseCalendar class</A>&nbsp;does, by not having a maximum date, is a strong and supportive statement of a long&nbsp;and powerful reign that is being [implictly] made....</FONT></P>

Jan 1-Jan 7 1989 are actually Showa (last year), and Jan 8-Dec 31st are Heisei Gannen. &nbsp;I don't know if windows displays this or not.<br><br>Also, I wonder how the abbreviations (in roman letters) will be handled if the era after Heisei has a name that starts with H, S, T or M. <br><br>Windows doesn't include era names for older periods of Japanese history?<br><br><br><br></div>

<p>&quot;Why six months?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't want you should die *suddenly*.&quot;</p>
<p>Also there are the Chasidim of the Dead, the Breslover Chasidim who still recognize Rebbe Nachman of Breslov as their one and only rebbe, notwithstanding he died almost 200 years ago....</p></div>

<h1>The font width is broken? Well, fix it!</h1>

<P><FONT face="Courier New"><STRONG>There are definitely times that people want to have a fixed width font. You know, times that you want the text to be like a grid and then you want every letter to fill one cell of the grid and have it all line up. Like in code windows, for example. Do you know what I mean? Do you ever want things to be that way, yourself?</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Good, I can stop doing that now (since for the most part blog posts are not one of those times!).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So some people will test out <A href="http://www.donationcoder.com/Forums/bb/index.php?topic=2499.0">18 different fixed width fonts</A> to try to decide which one they like best.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Other people are excited about the new Consolas font, so much so that they are not disuaded by the <A href="http://weblogs.asp.net/cazzu/archive/2005/07/27/LonhornPorno.aspx#420688">humorously scandalous claims</A> about its name....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Those&nbsp;others&nbsp;I mentioned&nbsp;(like <A HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/glengordon/archive/2006/05/04/590205.aspx">Glen</A>) have&nbsp;pointed out that you can <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=22e69ae4-7e40-4807-8a86-b3d36fab68d3&amp;displaylang=en">download Consolas</A> if you are using Visual Studio 2005, though some of those who answered Glen's post in the comments have pointed out that the screen real estate can become an issue, and others (<A href="http://www.larkware.com/dg5/TheDailyGrind876.html">like Mike</A>) prefer to be using good old Courier.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Personally, I am holding out for my dream font (<STRONG>Comic Sans MS Fixed</STRONG>), though this is most likely a pipe dream. But wouldn't it be cool?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/Comic.jpg"></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>(no, that is not a real font, but it would be cool, in my opinion -- not everyone wants to <A href="http://www.bancomicsans.com/">ban Comic Sans</A>! But a guy can dream!)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I must admit that short of my dream coming true, my choice for the best fixed with font is the one that makes the best use of screen real estate and that looks good with my unusual color choices in code editors, and that I can put in the smallest sizes. And in quick tests, Consolas looks like a very promising choice on my laptop.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Though there are some languages that will never work properly with a fixed width font without a <STRONG>LOT</STRONG> of work&nbsp;and a willingness to sometimes&nbsp;negotiate only cells that line up and not single width per character (kind of like <A HREF="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/09/11/463672.html">the CJK fonts do</A>, but much more so).&nbsp;So unless you have several million dollars to burn, I don't think you will be able to pitch an <STRONG>Arial Unicode MS Fixed</STRONG> to a font foundry any time soon....</FONT></P>

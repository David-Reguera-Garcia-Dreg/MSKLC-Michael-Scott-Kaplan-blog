<h1>Font embedding -- the intro</h1>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I used to be very naive about how font licensing worked.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>This is going back a few years, around the time just before <A HREF="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/02/12/371650.html"><STRONG>I started the MSLU contract</STRONG></A>. My own website was supporting several different languages, including Hindi and Tamil, but not too many people had the fonts.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I did have the <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/TrueTypeProperty21.mspx">Font Properties Extension</A>, and looking at the Windows 2000 version of MANGAL.TTF and LATHA.TTF, it was hard to miss the text on the Embedding tab:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/win2000_mangal.jpg">&nbsp; <IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/win2000_latha.jpg"></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The text seemed clear enough as to the meaning of <STRONG>Installable embedding allowed</STRONG>: "fonts may be embedded in documents and permanently installed on the remote system." So, without consulting with a lawyer, I added a download link for the fonts.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I think I mentioned that I was kind of naive about this stuff, right? I think I proved it, there....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>There was not too much time before it was explained to me -- I received a cease and desist letter. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Of course I immediately took the fonts down (it freaked me out a bit to be even unknowingly violating the rules in a way that would upset the people who were paying the bills!).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But I was still curious, so after I had taken them down&nbsp;I asked the person who sent me the mail what the text meant if it did not mean that they could be installed as .TTF files? Simon passed on a link to WEFT, the <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/WEFT.mspx">Web Emedding Fonts Tool</A>, and I learned quite a bit about font embedding, eventually culminating in the font embedding work I described in <STRONG><A HREF="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/04/19/577945.html">They called it the 'Surrogate IME'</A></STRONG>.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Now the actual support for using embedded fonts was never too well described, until&nbsp;not too long ago&nbsp;when it was fully documented so that anyone could make use of these items -- the <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/gdi/t2embed_Font_EmbeddingReference.asp">Font Embedding Reference</A>. The introduction on that page explains what the functions in t2embed.dll are used for:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT size=2>The Font Embedding Services Library provides a mechanism to bundle TrueType® and Microsoft OpenType fonts into a document or file. Typically, a document containing embedded fonts needs those fonts for rendering the document on another computer. Embedding a font guarantees that a font specified in a file will be present on the computer receiving the file. Some fonts, however, cannot be moved to other computers due to copyright issues limiting distribution. </FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>With the information there about the <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/gdi/t2embed_Font_EmbeddingFunctions.asp">functions</A>, <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/gdi/t2embed_Font_EmbeddingStructures.asp">structures</A>, and <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/gdi/t2embed_EmbeddingFunctionErrorMessages.asp">error messages</A>, the&nbsp;story on how to use the ".EOT" embedded font files is provided!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I'll be digging into these functions a bit more in the not-too-distant future, to give some real examples of making use of this functionality in your applications....</FONT></P>

It will be in a future release of the PSDK, and if people need it in the meantime, let me know and we can get it out to you....</div>

<p><a id="8348331" href="#8348331">#</a> <strong>Mark Irving</strong> on 1 Apr 2008 11:57 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><P>TTEmbedFontEx is documented as available on Windows 2000 (all of NT, 2000, XP and Vista), but a call to GetProcAddress for it which succeeds on XP and Vista fails on 2000. Have I missed something such as a redistributable for 2000, or do I have to make do with TTEmbedFont? The latter would be a shame, since it will involve special-case code which only gets exercised on the relatively little-used Windows 2000.</P></div>

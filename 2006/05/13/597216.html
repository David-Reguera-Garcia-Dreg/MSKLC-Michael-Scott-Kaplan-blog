<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I was reading Mark Lieberman's <A href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003128.html">Cautionary Tale</A> and that part at the end gave me pause for thought:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">

<P dir=ltr><FONT face=Tahoma>Mark, you should install the <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/tools/msklc.mspx">Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator</A> and create a Linear B keyboard!</FONT></P>
<P dir=ltr><FONT face=Tahoma>We might also have to get you a PC with Windows on it, huh? :-)</FONT></P>
<P dir=ltr><FONT face=Tahoma>Let me know, I probably have something over here I could spare....</FONT></P>

I'm ecumenical when it comes to operating systems, at least within reason.<br>(3) The Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator looks like fun -- but my problem at the time that I wrote that post was that it was 2:51 p.m., and I had started composing the post at about 2:35 p.m., and I was due to chair a meeting in another building at 3:00. &nbsp;So when I implied that I didn't have time to deal with Unicode, I lliterally meant that I didn't have time to deal with Unicode, no matter how convenient the process might be made to be...<br></div>

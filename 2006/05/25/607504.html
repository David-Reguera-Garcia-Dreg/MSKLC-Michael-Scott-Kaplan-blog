<h1>SQL Server's cross-version collation support</h1>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I had the day off today, though I did end up going to a meeting or two with some SQL Server folks (they set the meeting up before I was told we were getting the day, and I didn't want to make them suffer for the tardy notice!).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>In between meetings, I was talking to someone who pointed out that although they enjoyed reading my blog that they thought I had the wrong take in posts like <A HREF="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/05/15/417601.html">this one</A> and <A HREF="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/05/18/419112.html">this one</A> when I talk about the differences between SQL Server collations.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The way he posed the question had to do with the way <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winui/winui/windowsuserinterface/resources/strings/stringreference/stringfunctions/comparestringex.asp">CompareStringEx</A>, <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/intl/nls_LCMapStringEx.asp">LCMapStringEx</A>, and <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/intl/nls_FindNLSStringEx.asp">FindNLSStringEx</A> have a reserved parameter with the name <EM>lpVersionInformation</EM>.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>He knew that the docs say "<FONT size=2><STRONG>[in] Reserved. Must be NULL.</STRONG></FONT>" and that perhaps it would never be hooked up, even in a future version like happened in <A HREF="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/02/01/522164.html">the MessageBoxIndirect case</A>. But clearly there appears to be some future thought toward thesupport of multiple versions, even if it never happens.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So, in this context, he asked me how&nbsp;the core scenarios of such a future version of the collation functions would be any different than the scenarios that SQL Server has had available to it since&nbsp;SQL Server 2000. Wasn't I perhaps being a bit too hasty in talking about the cross-version support's problems when I should actually be thinking about this first foray into multiple version support so that I could learn from it?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I thought about it and in the end I must admit that he has a point here -- not taking the time to understand all of the problems and benefits and opportunities and even bugs that come out of the SQL Server implementation would actually force a future Windows implementation to work through the exact same problems/benefits/opportunities/bugs all over again!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>A pioneer deserves the credit for its place in history, so a quick nod to SQLS, and I'll do some thinking about these things.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Some of my thinking I will do aloud here, within the context of all of things that are both possible and impossible within SQL Server (2000 and 2005). Perhaps we can all learn something. :-)</FONT></P>

Must be NULL&quot;<br>It feels like they are designed to be extended, but is not really possible to do it, because of backward compatibility. So why &quot;reserve&quot; something that will never be used?<br></div>

<P>Richard asked in the Suggestion Box, and I decided to dispatch quickly: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>Why is it that English (en-US, because there is no en-GB) Windows and .NET don't know how to upper case a Latin Small Latter Sharp S even with the de-DE locale specified: <BR><BR>"\u00DF".ToUpper(CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo("de-DE")) <BR><BR>does not return "SS", but "ß"? <BR><BR>The Unicode casing file <A href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/CaseFolding.txt">CaseFolding.txt</A> has <BR><BR>00DF; F; 0073 0073; # LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S <BR><BR>Is this a Window's limitation? (Which would not help, given I'm trying to put together a demo of doing the right thing to build I18n into an application update.) </FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This is a question I have talked about many times in the past, as a simple <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/search.aspx?q=U%2b00df&amp;p=1">search for U+00df</A> indicates. And most importantly, since <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/03/15/551773.html"><STRONG>Casing and IgnoreCase are still not the same thing</STRONG></A> and <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/01/11/511557.html"><STRONG>Collation != Case (a.k.a. Collation &lt;&gt; Case)</STRONG></A>, for now this is how casing will work on Microsoft platforms -- what Unicode refers to as <STRONG>simple</STRONG> casing....</P>

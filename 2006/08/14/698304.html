<P>The recent post about <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/08/11/695147.html"><STRONG>Are ligatures supposed to be thought of as 'single characters'?</STRONG></A> had a <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/08/11/695147.html#697837">comment</A> from RubenP that I thought could use some further conversation: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>It must be said, but all the ClearType fonts with automatic fi ligatures look exceptionally bad for the sequence 'fij'; if you remember, the ij is quite frequent in Dutch, so that's a little troublesome. &nbsp;(To me at least ;-) <BR><BR>But then again, the few fonts that contain a combining acute accent, hardly ever actually combine it with the j, and if they do, the accent is markably different from the accent on the (pre composed) i. Adding acutes to ij is actually something you'd want in Dutch (the acute is an emphasis mark and ij is a vowel; well a diphtong actually). But because of the very poor support for this kind of thing, even the official rule has become i acute + j, rather than i acute + j acute. <BR><BR>Oh, and how does one stop these ligatures from happening? For example, in Turkish? IIRC the fi ligature is a big no-no in Turkish typography, because you cannot distinguish it from f + dotless i. <BR>With such silly things, I guess non-American digital typography still has a long way to go... </FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>It is a fair point. What is often hinted at (like in Bill Hills's <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/fontblog/archive/2005/10/07/477150.aspx">first post on fontblog</A>) is that the two languages that got the most research and attention when it comes to ClearType and the many ClearType fonts are English and Japanese. And there id no shortcut to skip that research step....</P>
<P>It becomes obvious, when one considers the needs of languages like Dutch and Turkish such as those that RubenP pointed out, that not all of the Western Latin script languages were truly having their individual needs considered when the development of some of the so-called "C* fonts" took place. </P>
<P>The needs here are inded&nbsp;<EM>sometimes</EM> script-specific&nbsp;but more often&nbsp;language-specific. And it is way too easily (when adding features that&nbsp;might be thought&nbsp;to look good for one language) to unintentionally screw over another language. Not to screw it over too much, mind you. Just to screw it over about the usual amount, if you know what I mean. </P>
<P>It's not like you can change these defaults later -- imagine what it would do to page flow and formatting in documents if such a global change were made -- a backcompat nightmare, to say the least!</P>
<P>Perhaps, in retrospect, a more generic approach to these kinds of issues like the fi ligature could have been done in the C* fonts. After all, this is a lesson we already learned in Microsoft Sans Serif and Tahoma. But typeface design at its best is a much more organic process than trying to imitate another font.&nbsp; So in the end if a particular feature is on by default in a font and that feature is not so good for your language, then perhaps using logic to come to the conclusion that this is not the best font for the language in question is in order? :-)</P>
<P>So while it is true that many people are excited about the optional language features in OpenType and the exciting readability of ClearType, I find myself much more excited about the next ten years -- when the work that has happened here can be further tuned to cater to the needs of even more languages than the ones for which ClearType is optimized now. And when the ability to work with optional OpenType features is available in products like Microsoft Word and Publisher. When the promises&nbsp;devlopered&nbsp;upon in&nbsp;technologies in Vista and Office 2007 are extended to cover so much more of the world....</P>
<P>In the meantime, my Visual Studio font is either Consolas or Courier New, depending on how much "Terminal Services to XP" work I have to do (since "ClearType over TS to an XP box" is not really quite there just yet!).</P>
<P>Makes for an exciting future, in any case. :-)</P>

Some words get put on different lines, and some paragraphs become one line shorter or longer. So some table columns get a tiny bit wider and some get a tiny bit thinner. Very occasionally a paragraph may spill onto an extra page, or unspill from an extra page just before a page breaking element (new section header) causing all the following elements to be a page (or even two if the section element is e.g. always on an odd page) different from last time the document was viewed.<br><br>So what? Are you saying that our document processors can't handle that?<br><br>Last I heard, Word does that between different versions anyway, and can also do it in the same version depending on the printer/paper settings of the computer it's loaded on.<br><br>Heck, if my document processor gets a better layout engine, I *want* it to rearrange the document so its better than it was before. That's what it's supposed to do! That's the point. It's *supposed* to be automating these things.<br><br>Isn't it?<br></div>

In other words: *very* hard.)<br><br>Still, for some reason, TeX seems a lot more robust in this sense (and others). Now only if someone could coerse TeX into properly supporting multiple columns and floating figures with text wrapping around them... OpenType in TeX is already well underway (XeTeX, IIRC), and there you actually do get control over each and every feature (such as complex scripts, ligatures, or explicitly *no* ligatures).<br><br>It boggles the mind when an ancient system like TeX can be extended to support OpenType even though it started out as a 7-bit system, but the only significant upgrade Word has gotten since Word 95 seems to be a spiffy new GUI. I know from good sources, that typographers were (again) not pleased with the 'new' Word.<br><br>Still, Word c.s. beat the heck out of the ancient TeX when you're writing a simple document, and the ease of use argument still holds. Just don't expect pretty typography: it's a word processor, not a typesetter.</div>

(Given that with a long document you are probably more likely to worry about the content before playing with things like header style formatting, this is a valid concern.) Or if you've got a new image to replace diagram 34, but it's not exactly the same size/aspect ratio. In fact, the new diagram 34 is a better aspect ratio for what it's displaying than the old one was, and you don't want to squish it and spend ages trying to make it *exactly* the same size as the old one was.<br><br>Laying stuff out on a page is a completely automatable task, and has been since around 1978.

I can't really think why the situation is reversed, to be honest. And in programs like Word, you indicate the language of the text. That way (because OpenType was designed that way, not because Office actually implements it that way, because it doesn't), the font designers could be told to not apply the fi-ligature for Turkish (that could be a rule laid out by the various localization experts), or to adjust the fi-ligature for Turkish, keeping the same metrics, but making the dot on the i visible again.<br><br>Still, that would be possible if Office actually supported the various OpenType features not related to complex scripts, but to typography. These f-ligatures are typographical, not semantic like the arabic ligatures.<br><br>Maybe in the next version of Word. Word 2011 if we're lucky ;-)<br><br>As an example that's even worse, many Adobe OpenType fonts implement a Th-ligature, to show off the kewlness of OpenType, I guess. But unfortunately, not many people think it's appropriate. Unlike the f-ligatures such as fi fj fl fb fh fk that were invented purely for readability, Th shouldn't really melt together in most fonts and it's even more English-centric than an fi ligature. <br><br>Oh, and try the automatic ligature example with German typographers! They believe that ligatures shouldn't happen between boundries of compound words, so Kaufl&#228;che does have an fl-ligature, but Kaufleute doesn't. Not even OpenType is going to help us here! A less WYSIWYG system like TeX has explicit provisions for this (because no-one in Germany has a keyboard containing the zero-width non-joiner, zero width no-break space or word joiner), so you'd type Kaufl&quot;ache and Kauf&quot;|leute or Kauf\/leute.

I have at had, for example, Jan van Krimpen's important _Memorandum over het maken van ontwerpen van Monotype-letters..._, which displays this typographic convention. In short, use of the fi ligature in Dutch is fijn.<br><br>Suppression of the fi ligatures in Turkish require support for OpenType language system tags and the Localised Forms 'locl' feature. It is unfortunate that such support has been considered a low priority by software developers. It should be seen as essential as other language shaping layout features such as those employed to ensure the correct forms of Arabic letters are displayed in the appropriate contexts. This is especially true in the case of something like the Turkish fi vs fı situation, in which there is the possibility of linguistic confusion.<br><br>I disagree, Michael, that font developers should be tailoring fonts to the limitations of current software, providing a generic approach that supports a broad range of languages at the lowest common denominator. The C* fonts are fine: they all have appropriate OTL language system tag structures for Turkish ligature handling.

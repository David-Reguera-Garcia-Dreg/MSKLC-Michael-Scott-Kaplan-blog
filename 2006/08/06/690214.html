<P>Okay, I admit it. When I pronounce the word <STRONG>italics</STRONG>, I say EYE-talics, not IH-talics. But I do say IH-talian, not EYE-talian when I see the word <STRONG>Italian</STRONG>. </P>
<P>I point this out because although she had never corrected me on this particular point even once before, or even ever hinted that the pronunciation was wrong, soon after she had some typography program managers reporting to her,&nbsp;Cathy pointed this out to me one day. </P>
<P>But in the end I think she was just enjoying correcting me; after all, both forms are acceptable in dictionaries for italics but not for Italian! I mean, the point of language is communication, and as long as people get the message neither pronunciation is really going to confuse anyone....</P>
<P>This post has little or nothing to do with that, but it is about <EM>italics</EM>. :-)</P>
<P>Well, actually it is about <A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0453">U+0453</A>, a.k.a. CYRILLIC SMALL LETTER GJE. </P>
<P>It seems that depending on the font you choose, the italicizes differently. For example, in Tahoma it looks like this:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/gje_tahoma.png"></P>
<P>and with the new Segoe UI font it looks like this:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/gje_segoeui.png"></P>
<P>Boy, that Segoe UI one looks like it has a bug, doesn't it? I mean who on earth would expext a character that looks more like:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/gje.png"></P>
<P>(a <STRONG>lowercase r</STRONG> or <STRONG>small gamma</STRONG>&nbsp;than anything else) in any font, <STRONG>including</STRONG> Segoe UI, look more like a <STRONG>reversed s</STRONG> just because it was italicized?</P>
<P>Turns out it is not a bug! </P>
<P>Simon Daniels talked with Steve Matteson of <A href="http://www.ascendercorp.com/">Ascender</A> who had this to say: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>the 'backwards s' is the preferred italic form for Russian lowercase Ghe but for Macedonian lowercase Gje it needs to stay the 'small gamma' shape. Sorry I don't know the specifics on <STRONG>why</STRONG>.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Looking up in Wikipedia's article about <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrillic_script">the Cyrillic script</A>, it does say a bit about this:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>In the absence of Roman and Italic traditions, Cyrillic type fonts are properly classified as upright (Russian: pryamoi shrift) and cursive (kursivnyi). Cursive or hand-written shapes of many letters, especially the lowercase letters, are entirely different from the upright shapes. As in Latin typography, a sans-serif face may have a mechanically-sloped oblique font (naklonnyi).<BR><BR>In Bulgarian, Macedonian, and Serbian, some cursive letters are different from those used in other languages. These cursive letter shapes are often used in upright fonts as well, especially for road signs, inscriptions, posters and the like, less so in newspapers or books.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The article also links to another page that has a much fuller explanation, entitled <A href="http://jankojs.tripod.com/SerbianCyr.htm">Serbian Cyrillic Letters BE, GHE, DE, PE, TE</A>. The page also talks a bit about the tradition of italics in typography, and the expectations here. A worthwhile read if you are interested in solutions here.</P>
<P>Now I will not go so far as to say that Tahoma and fonts that don't use this form are tailored for Bulgarian, Macedonian, or Serbian; in fact, I'll note that although Microsoft ships a '<FONT face=Tahoma>Tahoma</FONT>' and a '<STRONG><FONT face=Tahoma>Tahoma Bold</FONT></STRONG>' that we don't ship a '<FONT face=Tahoma><EM>Tahoma Italics</EM></FONT>'. Which kind of removes the easiest way to have an alternate form for the small Ghe, doesn't it? :-)</P>
<P>Between that and the fact that there is currently a Russian localization of Windows but not a Macedonian one, it sort of makes sense that the default form in the UI font of much of&nbsp;Vista and Office 2007 would follow the Russian glyph preference....</P>
<P>It does mean that the issue Chris Pirillo has pointed out <A href="http://chris.pirillo.com/2006/05/24/windows-vista-feedback/">here</A>&nbsp;about the inconsistency of application of the new UI font (discussed previously <STRONG><A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/06/11/626100.html">here</A></STRONG>) might be a bit more worrying for Vista and Office 2007, since between <FONT face="MS Sans Serif">MS Sans Serif</FONT>, <FONT face=Tahoma>Tahoma</FONT>, <FONT face="Segoe UI">Segoe UI</FONT>, and <FONT face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Microsoft Sans Serif</FONT>, only <FONT face="Segoe UI">Segoe UI</FONT> is getting it right. This might make the Russian localization of Windows a bit more challenging with this inconistency of font being used, huh? </P>
<P>Luckily the uppercase&nbsp;form (<A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0403">U+0403</A>) does not have this difference, so at worst it will just like we capitalize like morons in Russian in those places where the UI font is inconsistent? :-)</P>

I suppose it's related to the handwritten form where for instance the gje (or even the normal ghe) is more written as the greek tau which is more similar to gamma, with the small difference that the horizontal line above is straight, a bit above and not wavy.<br>A small mystery as well is the t that in italic looks as a latin m (I hate this as I'm bilingual and it knocks my OCR system in tilt ;). And to add to this if you take the latin m and turnit upside down you get the sha, but the cherry on top is that both t and sha are written differently in handwritten form with the t written with a horizontal line on top and the sha having a horizontal line below (but not obligatory, it's to distinguish more easily between sha and i ). Hope it was interesting for people that like letters and I'd have a rant about the d as well :).<br>Michel did you get my private message on the issue of accented letters on the macedonian layout?</div>

In Dutch it's just 'cursief' (and I believe the Germans stick to Kursiv). Slanted/oblique is not very common. I believe you should use 'schuinschrift' (skewed writing), but I've never actually heard people refer to 'Arial/Helvetica schuinschrift'. True italics always looked better to me, even for sans serif typefaces. Glad Segoe 'borrowed' that idea from Frutiger Neue rather than Frutiger.<br><br>And ditto on the synthetic obliques. I mean, why does Verdana have a real oblique, but Tahoma doesn't. It's the same bloody typeface!<br><br>Besides, there's a bug with the LATIN SMALL LETTER A in Segoe UI Italic as well ;-)</div>

However, the point is well taken, as we can't control where a font gets used we decided to include Italics (true ones) in Segoe UI, based on the amount of fake Tahoma Italic we’ve seen over the years on the web and elsewhere. &nbsp; &nbsp; <br><br>As for Frutiger Next Italics. Linotype obviously lifted that idea straight from Myriad as a way of getting back at Adobe. ;-)<br><br>Michael, if you’re interested in Italics a post on Meiryo Italics would be a good one. &nbsp;<br></div>

I believe some sort of localization effort was undertaken by MS as a part of the deal (or it's local subsidiary) but I'm not sure as I don't live in Macedonia for quite some time. I thought just to drop a note on the geo-politics in relation to the C9 interview. Some people criticyzed the goverment on that move and the trend today is that many public administrations try to move to the OS camp but my point of view it was the right choice to be made at the time.<br>Anyhow, we live in a day and age of choice and interoperability so I guess we just need to wait and see how things evolve. <br></div>

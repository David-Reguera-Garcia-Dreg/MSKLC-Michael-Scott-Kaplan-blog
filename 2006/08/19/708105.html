<P>You read about it here first, I guess. But the results are in.</P>

<P>I actually have been telling people I am, all things being equal, a nice guy. Apparently this is one of my evil ploys....</P>
<P>I'd talk about the differences in the terms (evil vs. angelic)&nbsp;and the sloppy word choice there. Like maybe it should have been evil vs. good, or devilish vs. angelic, or somesuch. You know, a more balanced set of word choices. If one is going to be judgmental, one should at least be objective and deterministic in one's methodology, or at least in one's language.</P>
<P><EM>I guess, looking at the questions, the ship has kind of sailed on that issue, anyway.</EM> :-)</P>
<P>All things considered though,&nbsp;it probably is&nbsp;just that kind of ornery, have to pick a fight, have to disagree with someone else's conventions, have to nitpick, and have to close the comparison&nbsp;with a snide italicized comment&nbsp;kind of attitude that got me the whole evil tag in the first place....</P>

It’s not “you” per se . . . it’s why some people “hate” the United States – they’ll say they “hate” our county, our politicians, our foreign polices – but always add they don’t “hate” the people of the United States. <br><br>So don’t ever take it personally – and understand with almost a BILLION Microsoft users, your small handful of critics simply seem to be louder then the rest of us.<br></div>

Kaplan</strong> on 19 Aug 2006 7:43 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Hmmm... the site had no idea I work for Microsoft, so it just did it on the basis of my answers. I never took it as them thinking MS was evil (I mentioned in my Dell support experience the other day that know they think MS is evil, that's no worry for me). <BR><BR>In this case, the determination of evility was judged solely by my answers to the quiz!</div>

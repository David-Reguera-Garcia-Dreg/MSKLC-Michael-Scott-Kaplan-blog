<P>A question came to myself and a few others the other day, about how to make people more aware of international support in Windows. You know, how to evangelize the area. </P>
<P>My first thought was indeed the title of this post. I mean, I'm no Robert Scoble, but I seem to have enough readers here to indicate that even if it isn't fashionable to actually <EM>read</EM> all the dreck I write, it is at least fashionable to look at it once in a while. Does this blog not count as a form of <STRONG><EM>International Evangelism</EM></STRONG> in various MS products, mostly Windows and the .NET Framework?</P>
<P>Now I can hardly hope to cover everything that needs coverage given the primary way to inspire me to post something (anything!) is simply to interest me in it, and clearly my interests have four flaws in this regard:</P>
<UL>
<LI>I have a much broader range of things I am interested than just international stuff, 
<LI>Not <EM>everything</EM> in the international space interests me, 
<LI>There is, frankly, way too much to cover even if the first two points weren't true, and 
<LI>The people who read here are obviously a small (if undeliably intersting,&nbsp;intelligent, and attractive!) subset of the folks that would need to be reached.</LI></UL>
<P>In short, the simple truth is that <STRONG>Mikey don't scale</STRONG>, and even if I did, I am hardly the ideal mouthpiece from a corporate standpoint (and I am&nbsp;paranoid enough to believe that&nbsp;at least one person reads every post religiously looking for a fireable offense!).</P>
<P>And even if I did scale, the fact is that not everyone reads blogs. They are not the one true&nbsp;answer to the generic question here.</P>
<P>So the real question comes in -- how to get people interested in the most important topic, if not <EM>in</EM> then at least&nbsp;<EM>for</EM>, the world -- what would <STRONG><EM>International Evangelism</EM></STRONG> look like, if there were an effort to handle it in a more scalable manner? If some attempt were made in terms of process and resources to try to tackle the issue of <STRONG><EM>International Awareness</EM></STRONG>?</P>
<P>As I am often wont to do these days with such a question, I thought I'd see if anyone out there had any thoughts on the matter. How do you make people more aware of a feature that works best when people do not even notice it is there, when everything they try to do in whatever language they do it in simply works?</P>
<P>What do you think?</P>

<p><strong>Tom Gewecke</strong> on 17 Aug 2006 1:45 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">I would consider MS, which at least has its &quot;Dr. International,&quot; home free in terms of international awareness compared to other platforms like &nbsp;the Mac. The general lack of info for the latter inspired me to put up a site devoted to the issue over 5 years ago:<br><br><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://homepage.mac.com/thgewecke/mlingo9s.html">http://homepage.mac.com/thgewecke/mlingo9s.html</a><br><br>I can't say I've ever detected much interest. &nbsp;Only &nbsp;a tiny &nbsp;proportion of users seem to ever want info on working in more than one language, and Apple has never expanded its own info support.</div>
<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 17 Aug 2006 8:30 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Of course the problem is also when end users want to do stuff and they do not know how, also... right?</div>
<p><strong>Richard</strong> on 21 Aug 2006 9:42 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">&gt; &nbsp;International Evangelism<br><br>This could cover three things:<br>1. Why<br>2. What<br>3. How<br><br>However, one could argue that if developers (or more specifically &quot;product managers&quot;/marketing/... -- those who decied what is implemented) get #1, then the others are just a matter of some check lists and links to where the detail is.<br><br>Like many things, once i18n has been accepted as needed, it is done (or at least try to). Making the business case (and CBA) to put it on the agenda is the real challenge.</div>
<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 21 Aug 2006 10:18 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Hi Richard, <br><br>Yes, I agree with that (especially the overriding importance of #1 here), but to convince people of #1, you have to have a lot of #2, and once you have #1 via lots of examples in #2, you definitely have to have the answers (more #2 and lots of #3, with occasional additional #1 and #2 to justfy the directions you take through #3), if you want to have any credibility, I mean).<br><br>So you pretty much have to have all three to have any credibility in being an &quot;international awareness&quot; provider, right?</div>
<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 21 Aug 2006 10:25 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Or perhaps one could argue that "international evangelism" has as a primary goal a marketing role, which must have the following: <BR><BR>a) A ton of the WHY <BR>b) heavy index value into redirecting to&nbsp;WHAT and&nbsp;HOW <BR><BR>In other words,&nbsp;WHAT and&nbsp;HOW could be thought of as more crucial in the "what it points to"&nbsp;and&nbsp;WHY as "what it is" ? <BR><BR>Would that have sufficient credibility? Or would that be looked at as having too much sizzle and not enough steak?</div>
<p><strong>Richard</strong> on 22 Aug 2006 6:00 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">&gt; a) A ton of the WHY<br>&gt; b) heavy index value into redirecting to WHAT and HOW<br><br>Yes. The evangelism is all about awareness and buyin, a lot of the how is out there (notably in this blog). Getting the decision makers to do it is the challenge (everyone speaks English after all, you just need to speak slowly and loudly :-)).<br></div>

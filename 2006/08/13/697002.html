<P>Julie Bennett was telling me that Samuel L. Jackson called her to tell her about seeing <A href="http://snakesonaplane.com/">Snakes on a Plane</A>, and while I admit that I was somewhat skeptical I should have realized that Julie would never deceive me. Someone among her many friends must have gone up to <A href="http://snakesonaplane.varitalk.com/">this site</A> to arrange the call. :-)</P>
<P>Sorry for ever doubting you, hon! </P>
<P>Though when Cathy and I both admitted to finding Patrick Hall's <A href="http://blogamundo.net/dev/2006/04/27/loonicode0003/">take</A> on the movie to be pretty funny, Julie decided we were both geeks.</P>
<P><EM>Fair enough. Yet another reason that I have no plans to become a hairdresser any time soon. </EM></P>
<P><EM>Well, that and the fact that although I find brushing through the long tresses of people I know and like to be soothing (as do they),&nbsp;that&nbsp;a) sharp objects, b) total strangers, and c) me are simply not a safe combination. Sorry about that....</EM></P>
<P>I am sure Julie might have felt differently about how geeky we were had&nbsp;we succeeded in&nbsp;getting Wonder Woman's INVISIBLE JET encoded. I am not giving up hope, what with <STRONG><A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/06/14/428797.html">this proposal</A></STRONG> still out there. Because you wouldn't have to put a magic lasso around around me to get the truth about whether the INVISIBLE JET should be encoded -- we definitely need it in the standard.</P>
<P>Maybe that could be the sequel -- Snakes on an Invisible Plane.</P>

<P>It was like 19 years ago, and it was the summer before my senior year of high school, perhaps a month or two before I moved to Philadelphia. </P>
<P>I drove to the west side of Cleveland, to see a band that had a song called <STRONG>Ship of Fools</STRONG> which was an MTV Hip Clip of the Week -- <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Party">World Party</A>. You know, back when MTV was more about actually playing videos.</P>
<P>There were some minor troubles at the door given my young age, but I took the same approach as Rob Lowe did in Class, and when&nbsp;the bouncer&nbsp;asked how old I was, I said <STRONG>Fifty</STRONG> and handed him a $50 bill of my hard earned caddying money. He wordlessly let me in, and I got to see Karl Wallinger do his thing.... :-)</P>
<P>The show was actually quite good, and although I haven't actually seen any performances since then, I did notice that he is going to be at <A href="http://www.neumos.com/">Neumos</A> <A href="http://www.neumos.com/081006.html">tonight</A>. I don't think I will be able to make it, but my fond memories of the last show I saw in Cleveland do cause me to be a little sad about that. Maybe next time he makes it through....</P>
<P>If anybody reading this blog does make it to Neumos to see the show, let me know how it went, would you please?</P></FONT>

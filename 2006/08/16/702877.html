<P>My recent post <STRONG><A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/08/03/687472.html">Keyboard UI in setup hoist by its own petard?</A></STRONG>, or more specifically one of the screenshots in that post, caused dmanchester to <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/08/03/687472.html#688837">ask</A>: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>In that second screenshot of the Vista installation, what's going on with the window title and the "Enter your language..." text? Are those placeholders for yet-to-be-localized text? Does the use of Cyrillic and Greek in the placeholders help confirm fields' Unicode compatibility? </FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This is of course a pseudo-localized build, which is a great mechanism to find issues without waiting for the localized strings to come back from the folks doing the translation...</P>
<P>There are also many other issues that can be&nbsp;found by extending the principle to locales, which is the point that Shawn raises in his post <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/shawnste/archive/2006/06/27/647915.aspx">Pseudo Locales in Windows Vista Beta 2</A>.</P>
<P>Shawn's post links to the <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/intl/nls_PseudoLocales.asp">MSDN topic</A> that talks about these three locales that you can enable in Vista with a bit of registry tweaking. Though to be honest I would also recommend in addition to the entries documented to be added&nbsp;to HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Nls\Locale, also&nbsp;adding the entries to the HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Nls\Language key as well. I'm just saying. :-)</P>
<P>(The reversal of all the latin letters is something I provided the data for, though it was originally Shawn's idea!)</P>
<P>In any case, the MSDN topic mentions without explaining that you can test the "9-bit locale identifiers" [sic]. Some of you may recall when I talked about this issue with <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/intl/nls_238z.asp?frame=true#primary">Primary Language Identifiers</A> over a year ago in <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/03/02/383458.html"><STRONG>Why do LCIDs skip around so much?</STRONG></A>, where I pointed out the very real problem that bad app development that is not properly parsing LCIDs can cause.</P>
<P>And these three pseudo locales all have LCIDs that can help testing her, so I heartily recommend trying out these locales in you applications to see how things work for you. There is very little room left in the 8-bit <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/intl/nls_9c84.asp">PRIMARYLANGID</A> space, so future versions may start to really expose deep-seated application bugs....</P>

<P>But what, exactly, would i add to Nls\Language?</P>
<P>reg_sz "501", "l_intl.nls" ?</P>
<P>reg_sz "501", "0409" ?</P>
<P>reg_sz "501", "501" ?</P>
<P>You don't say *why* i would want to add them here, but i assume it's &nbsp;so they're visible though the control panel. And i can't really test how my application behaves under a different code page until i can select it.</P></div>
<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 17 Feb 2010 2:39 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><P>They're all fair game!</P>
<P>You want to add them to be the same as all the others. So reg_sz "0501", "l_intl.nls" is what you are looking for....</P></div>

<P>So when Bryan asked me the other day whether a <STRONG>Technical Aide</STRONG> was someone who reported to a <STRONG>Technical Lead</STRONG>, I had to smile.</P>
<P>It is not like the titles, which aim for consistency, really meet their goals.</P>
<P>A Software Development Enginner reports to a Development Lead who reports to a Development Manager.</P>
<P>And a Software Test Engineer reports to a Software Development Enginner in Test who reports to a Test Lead who reports to a Test Manager. Which is kind of consistent, too.</P>
<P>But then does a Program Manager report to a Program Manager Lead who reports to a Program Manager Manager?</P>
<P>No, a Program Manager reports to a Lead Program Manager who reports to a Group Program Manager.</P>
<P>Then all three of those managers may report to a Group Manager who may report to a&nbsp;Product Unit Manager may report to a Director who may report to&nbsp;a General Manager who may report to a Corporate Vice President who may report to a Vice President (or vice versa), and so on.</P>
<P>Consistency is not our weakness here.</P>
<P>Now I talked about a Technical Lead a bit in <STRONG><A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/03/15/395685.html">this post</A></STRONG>, but I can add to that the fact that a Technical Aide does not report to a Technical Lead.</P>
<P>A Technical Aide is kind of like the Microoft&nbsp;version of&nbsp;a Lord Privy Seal or a Minister Without Portfolio. They would usually report to someone really important like a CTO or a VP.... which of course I am not.</P>
<P>Maybe a Technical Lead could report to a Technical Aide, though usually not.</P>
<P>So Bryan, does that answer your question? :-)</P></FONT>

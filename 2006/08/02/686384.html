<P>I specifically avoided mentioning when Scott Hanselman put me in his Essential Blogroll in his <A href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=34">25th Podcast</A> (it was incredibly flattering, but I figured if you were already reading this blog&nbsp;then you didn't need to know that Scott was thinking good things about it!). :-)</P>
<P>But then he decided to cover Globalization and Internationalization with .NET in his <A href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=36">26th Podcast</A>. And this is definitely a good one to see, since (like Joel Spolsky's <A href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html">The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets (No Excuses!)</A>) will be the best way to let some people know about internationalization stuff in software who may otherwise never hear about it!</P>
<P><FONT size=2>Two small corrections in </FONT><A href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=34"><FONT size=2>#25</FONT></A><FONT size=2>, Scott: </FONT></P>
<OL>
<LI><FONT size=2>If Klingon ever makes it in, it is much more likely to be due to the hard work of </FONT><A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/shawnste/archive/2005/12/01/499137.aspx"><FONT size=2>this man</FONT></A><FONT size=2>, not me. I mean, unless the Klingon High Council contacts me directly and demands support for the honor of the Empire, that is....</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT size=2>Many people were instrumental to getting the Ethiopian script in general and the Amharic language in particular supported in Vista, though the one crucial piece I was heavily involved with&nbsp;(along with Ning Jin-Grisaffi and especially&nbsp;Daniel Yacob) was getting an Amharic input method into the product after we suddenly found out we did not have one!). I will probably blog more about this whole issue some day. :-)</FONT></LI></OL>
<P>In <A href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=36">#26</A>, he covers a lot of interesting ground and goes beyond talking about .NET when he covers stuff like the <STRONG><A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/06/14/631016.html">breaking Notepad</A></STRONG> issue and IsTextUnicode. As well as info on Unicode itself.</P>
<P>Highly recommended listening, as are pretty much all of <A href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/">the Hanselminutes</A>&nbsp;(as usual, I listen to all Podcasts by downloading the full .WMA file and then listening at 2x speed!)....</P>

<P>Peter asks:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>My customer is programming with .NET.<BR><BR>Now he wanted to know if there is a way to determine if a given day in a Calendar is a weekend based on certain culture.<BR><BR>It is “Friday/Saturday” in the Middle East, “Saturday/Sunday” in Europe/Americas and probably something else in somewhere else.<BR><BR>We are trying to find a method similar as IsWeekend(Date d).<BR><BR>Based on my research, this code below will get the first day of week based on the culture.<BR><BR><FONT face="Consolas,Courier New"><STRONG>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CultureInfo myCI = new CultureInfo("en-US");<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MessageBox.Show(myCI.DateTimeFormat.FirstDayOfWeek.ToString());<BR></STRONG></FONT><BR>Is there a similar method for the information about weekend?<BR><BR>Thanks!</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Hmmm. Not exactly the same question as the one asked in <STRONG><A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/09/20/471605.html">How many days in a weekend?</A></STRONG>, but close. And I did hypothesize back in that post from almost a year ago that the weekend was always in LOCALE_SDAYNAME6 and LOCALE_SDAYNAME7. But several people have pointed out that it ain't always so (there are&nbsp;indeed places that consider Sunday to be the first day of the week but Saturday/Sunday to the weekend.</P>
<P>So there really is no way in Windows or the .NET Framework to find out when the weekend is, per locale/culture.</P>
<P>What do you expect from a company with developers who think that working a half day means putting in 12 hours? :-)</P>

AFAIK, Sunday is the first day of the week and Saturday/Sunday are weekend days for locale en-US. Other places would be the southern-most state of the USA, namely Mexico, since we have followed the USA's lead in many regards.<br>Europeans can't help themselves to avoid bashing us for having such a &quot;weird&quot; thing as Sunday=first day of the week.<br><br>Besides, as you have pointed out, the definition of &quot;weekend&quot; is very subjective... for some fellow students, the weekend starts on Thursday, regardless of their current locale... :D</div>

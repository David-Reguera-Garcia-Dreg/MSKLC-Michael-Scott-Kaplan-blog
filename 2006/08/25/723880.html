<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>In your blog posting "Getting rid of your extra yen" on 2005/12/28, someone made a comment that even after the locale was changed from Japanese back to English, "MS Gothic" (rather than Lucida Console) remained in the list of available fonts for the Command Prompt. Today, I ran into exactly the same problem/behavior that Nicholas Allen (the commenter) was describing. Then I realized that any shortcuts made to cmd.exe while the OS was in Japanese locale retained the MS Gothic font whereas cmd.exe itself always displayed the list of fonts applicable to the current locale. So there appears to be something sticky about the codepage that gets recorded in the Shortcuts to cmd.exe. Thought you would like to know.<BR><BR>Thanks,<BR><BR>Cameron</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The post Cameron is referring to is <STRONG><A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/12/28/507759.html">here</A></STRONG>. :-)</P>
<P>This seemed like a worthwhile tip to share with people here, as it isn't terribly obvious that this is the case and I don't think I've ever seen it in the documentation....</P>

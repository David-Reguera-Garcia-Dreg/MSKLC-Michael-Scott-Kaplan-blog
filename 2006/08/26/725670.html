<P>Regular reader and Internationalization MVP Mihai asked in the Suggestion Box: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>Just read the today post ("Creation of transliterating input methods") <BR><BR>And I do agree with Thakara that the TSF documentation is very poor. <BR>If TSF is soo alive and well in Vista, and seems to be "the way to go," then maybe is time for a better doc. <BR><BR>I know, updating the MSDN can take long, but maybe you can shot some articles on the subject, to get us started? </FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The post Mihai is talking about is <STRONG><A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/08/18/706063.html">this</A></STRONG> one....</P>
<P>Well, I can't say I disagree with the idea; I said as much in <STRONG><A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/07/13/664497.html">this post</A></STRONG>, Though as I also said there, it will take some time to really dig in there. </P>
<P>But on the other hand, there are those other samples I have been posting for the Cantonese and Unicode IMEs -- which are also Text Service Framework TIPs. And I will be posting more samples of them, updates to those samples, and information about the format (and how it worked out to help for Yi and Amharic in Vista!).</P>
<P>So hang in there, I will be doing more posts soon in this area. :-)</P>

<P>The whole IMM based model is mostly non-functional for all of the TSF-based IMEs, as many posts have indicated. So ImmGetImeMenuItems, we expect to fail. The trick is finding out how to do the same thing with the Text Services Framework!</P></div>

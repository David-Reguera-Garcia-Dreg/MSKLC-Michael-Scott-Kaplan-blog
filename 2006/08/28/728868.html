<h1>There should always be a fallback available</h1>

<P>So during the season finale of Entourage, one of the sage pieces of advice given to Vince about his plan to fire Ari was that he really ought to get a feel for what is out there in terms of agents before he actually fires Ari. It is all about having a good fallback in case the resource you have been relying on turns out to not be able to come with the goods....</P>
<P>One of the things that has been built into the <STRONG><A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/02/10/370460.html">Language Interface Pack</A></STRONG> design, required due to the fact that it is only a partial localization, is the notion of a fallback language to use in case the resources do not exist in the expected language. </P>
<P>Hoefully you would not fire the LIP since it is not screwing up like Ari did, it is just doing its best. But clearly English is not always the best choice for language fallback.</P>
<P>In Vista, this notion has been further extended so that it does not have to only be embedded in the locale itself but can also be a user overridable choice. The Regional and Language Options tab will look as follows when a partial localization is chosen:</P>
<P><IMG height=575 src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/uilanguage.png" width=510></P>
<P>Notice how there is even a third language choice you can make if the second one is thought of as a partial localization.&nbsp;Importantly, note that&nbsp;neither the second nor the third choice will be visible if a partial localization is not chosen.</P>
<P>Which is not to say&nbsp;Dutch is a partial localization in Vista, but it is temporarily with not all the strings localized, and it allows the testng of this feature to happen more widely.</P>
<P>Now all of this is very cool, but I think the design is a bit flawed, in my opinion.</P>
<P>Because we actually encourage people to build their own applications with MUI-like features and we encourage them to use both the MUI resource loading and UI language functions, and clearly our business cases that are used to decide which localizations are full ones and which ones are partials will not always match those of an ISV writing an application with MUI functionality.</P>
<P>Therefore, the option to say "if you can't find <STRONG>this</STRONG> language, then use <STRONG>that</STRONG> one" should always exist. Because even if a full localization is involved, what we call full and what a user does are two different things....</P>

Or like Fedora Linux. Or like the language preferences in most browsers (including IE).<br><br>Now each application will be forced to design it's own language fallback list.<br><br>I was happy to see the MUI API getting public, but it is only a half-backed solution :-(<br></div>
<p><a id="729717" href="#729717">#</a> <strong>The SZ</strong> on 29 Aug 2006 5:09 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">I hope this dialog is a joke. Are you kidding. How many people are speaking three different languages? Which users should understand this? Which user wanna have a userinterface in three different languages?<br><br>Wait, I have a two new feature requests:<br><br>* I wanna have a random choosed language feature.<br>* On even days I wanna have all programms at the upper half of my destop using chineese, and the apps on the lower half using japaneese. On uneven days, all apps on the left side have to use french, and on the right side spanish.<br><br>Can you add this please?<br><br>Steffen<br></div>
<p><a id="730242" href="#730242">#</a> <strong>Mihai</strong> on 29 Aug 2006 12:55 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">&lt;&lt;How many people are speaking three different languages?&gt;&gt;<br>Many!<br>In fact, I think in Europe this is more the norm than the exception.<br><br>And it does not mean you will have one application in a mixture of 3 languages. If I select Romanian, French, English and an application (not part of the OS) is fully localized in French, I will get French UI in the application, no mixtures, no nothing.<br></div>
<p><a id="730493" href="#730493">#</a> <strong>RubenP</strong> on 29 Aug 2006 3:43 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Maybe a silly question, but as a .NET developer the first question I have is: how do *I* get the benefit of this MUI stuff? I.e./e.g., how does this relate to CultureInfo.UICulture and ResourceManagers? (And I'll be sticking my fingers in my ears and start singing stuff like 'lalala' if the answer involves P/Invoke.;-)<br><br>(And that many Europeans can speak three or more languages, does not mean they actually like that. I don't see that an average Flemish user would select French as a fallback language, or for a Walloon to select Dutch. They'd rather select English, or even [*gasp*] German. Reality usually doesn't leave a choice, but *given* the choice...)</div>

<P>It wasn't all that long ago that I was talking about how <STRONG><A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/08/18/706383.html">Sometimes, uppercasing sucks</A></STRONG>. And between that post and <STRONG><A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/08/22/708503.html">the follow-up one</A></STRONG> I was showing example strings like </P>
<P><FONT size=6>Ρύθμιση σήματος </FONT></P>
<P>which a native would expect to be capitalized not as </P>
<P><FONT size=6>ΡΎΘΜΙΣΗ ΣΉΜΑΤΟΣ </FONT></P>
<P>but instead as </P>
<P><FONT size=6>ΡΥΘΜΙΣΗ ΣΗΜΑΤΟΣ </FONT></P>
<P>and I pointed out that the NLS casing and collation tables, which pride themselves on features like reversibility and weighed equivalences, simply did not have this type of transformation in mind.</P>
<P>I even suggested that some people were considering the problem from a typographical point of view. Which really makes sense given that it is essentially an appearance issue much more than anything else -- but an important appearance issue, one&nbsp;that should not really be ignored.</P>
<P>And luckily, typographical wizard John Hudson pointed me to <A href="http://typophile.com/node/15982">this thread</A> over on&nbsp;Typophile that really digs into the issues of dealing with the expected appearance of uppercase Greek from the point of view of the fonts.... definitely worth a look as it really digs into some of the complexities. </P>
<P>So now that it turns out someone has actually been out there doing what I was just kinda hypothesizing about, I thought it would make sense to take a step back and make sure people understand the trade-offs of each method, so I'll talk about some of these issues in a future post....</P>

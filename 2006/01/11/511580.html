<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Simon Daniels pointed me at an article entitled <A href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4595228.stm"><STRONG>Why is Menzies pronounced Mingis?</STRONG></A>&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It is about <FONT face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Ȝ</FONT>, also known as YOGH.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Simon suggested it&nbsp;might be&nbsp;interesting for two reasons:</FONT></P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>It is one of the many characters being added to the core fonts for Vista;</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>If you pronounce it right, it&nbsp;sounds like&nbsp;BLOG, not YOGHurt (UK spelling in honor of the UK article!).</FONT></LI></UL>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I agree with the first point, though I am n</FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>ot sure why he thought I'd be interested in something that sounded like blog. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It has been a letter that I had never seen before I started working with Unicode, but once I was getting involved with the standard I saw it mentioned regularly. It seems that once upon a time it had been unified in Unicode with EZH (U+1d23) and Michael Everson produced a convincing proof that this was a false unification, linguistically speaking (an argument that carries a great deal of weight with many of the linguists and former linguists who work on the Unicode Standard). Anyway, ever since then Michael brings up the issue every time he talks about disunifications either done at his behest or at the behest of others after his attempts failed.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>A typical mention goes something like this:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><EM><FONT size=2>YOGH and EZH were disunified. Nuskhuri and Mkhedruli were disunified. The two QOPPAs were disunified. NUNAVUT H and AIVILIK B were disunified from Latin "H" and "b" as letters naturalized by Canadian Syllabics.</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>You get the point.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It is funny, but for me the issue of passive vocabulary was raised.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Since Michael Everson is in Ireland and I am usually not and since he usually does not come to the USA for UTC meetings, I do not see him all that often. But he would regularly mention the YOGH in email, and it just made me think of Yoghurt, so in my mind that was how it was pronounced. In a situation like that where it is constantly reinforced (albeit passively), it is hard to think of the pronunciation as being anything different -- until I got mail from Simon I did not actually know I was mistaken!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Perhaps the fact that it actually sounds like BLOG might help retrain me, given all the blogging I do.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And the fact that it is now going to be in the core fonts in Vista means that anyone will be able to see it, rather than the people who happen to have the right font.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So I guess Simon was right, and it is&nbsp;something cool to blog about. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

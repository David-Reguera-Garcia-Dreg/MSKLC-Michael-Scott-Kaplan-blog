<h1>Adding a new blog category?</h1>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I have been asked by a few people in email why I don't have a <STRONG>fonts</STRONG> or <STRONG>typography</STRONG> category.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I have actually been resistant to that, since although&nbsp;the area&nbsp;</FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>frankly fascinates the hell out of me, my lack of expertise on some of the important basics about the non-programming aspects about typography has given me pause.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I know I can't really compare with actual typoraphy experts, and I did not want to seem disrespectful.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The tack I take with the analagous situation regarding linguistics (i.e. making fun of my own <EM>delusions of linguistic aptitude</EM>) seemed inappropriate since I have no delusions about having any kind of typographical expertise. I have none, and Barney Rubble would be able to produce higher quality OpenType fonts than I....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Does anyone have any thoughts about this? Is such a category one that would be sensible and/or useful for the random posts that do touch upon fonts?</FONT></P>

Hence I'm not expecting such posts. Now this maybe a consequence of my total lack of knowledge in these areas and I might suddenly found them fascinating if you started to write about it. Who knows...<br><br>Anyway, up to you.</div>

Of course whether posts about font linking/fallback are interesting in a separate issue from general typography issues, right? :-)</div>
<p><a id="516191" href="#516191">#</a> <strong>Serge Wautier</strong> on 23 Jan 2006 9:07 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Michael,<br><br>Now you're confusing me ;-)<br>I suggest you write a post about whether font fallback/linking is a typography issue (I let you choose the category).<br>Oops, sorry, this is not the suggestion box :-D<br></div>

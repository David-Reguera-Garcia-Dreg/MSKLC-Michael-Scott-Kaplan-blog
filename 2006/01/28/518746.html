<h1>Localisation via Wiki?</h1>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma><EM>(UK spelling of localization in the title a nod to our friends on the other side of the puddle!)</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It was as long as six months ago and as recently as yesterday that people have asked me how I would feel about specific posts or perhaps even the whole blog here localized into one or more other target languages. I have usually been a bit nervous about anything beyond small attempts since my informal style is not the best target for a localizer.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But </FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>Joel Spolsky is trying out a bold experiment, described in his post entitled </FONT><FONT face=Tahoma><A href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/01/27.html">Translations</A>. He is trying a Wiki to support what would amount to </FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>a community translation project. Quite similar to what Wikipedia is doing with its content (though the latter is much scarier&nbsp;from a synchronization standpoint since </FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>the original source text could theoretically be any language!).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I&nbsp;have some experience&nbsp;in managing large volunteer translation projects, and I agree completely with Joel about the problems with maintaining them over time (I would add to his list&nbsp;</FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>the quality issues and the variability of methods people were wanting to use to provide the text!).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Now the Wiki idea&nbsp;here is&nbsp;undeniably is </FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>a very cool thing to keep an eye on, and I think it is a lot more likely to "succeed" (where success is defined as reasonable synchronization of content and consistent quality levels)&nbsp;</FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>than Wikipedia's model due to the impossibility of synchronization with source and target in constant flux. It is much more comfortable and indeed possible to stay in sync if you treat one as the master original and then any clouded or faulty meaning in the translations as a bug in localization for another language speaker to correct.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It will also be an interesting place for people who are interested in language differences to keep an eye on changes that are made.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Kudos, Joel!</FONT></P>

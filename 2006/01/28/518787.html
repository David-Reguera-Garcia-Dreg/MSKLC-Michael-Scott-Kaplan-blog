<P><FONT face=Tahoma>There is an old joke you have probably heard some version of:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman">One day a blonde decided that she was sick of all the "Dumb Blonde" jokes people were telling. She decided she would show everyone that blondes really were smart and set out to learn the capitol of each state in the USA. A few days later, she overheard the folks at the watercooler, again telling blonde jokes. Having had her fill of it all, our blonde hero interrupted the group and advised she could prove to them that all blondes were not dumb. She said she could give the capitol of any state, and taken aback by her confidence, a gentleman asked her to name the capitol of the State of Ohio. She thought for a moment, then proudly proclaimed "O"!</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>After reading Geoffrey K. Pullum's post <A href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002791.html">The parts of speech</A> </FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>on Language Log, I find myself feeling the same sense of frustration that Associated Press could get such a fundamental fact wrong.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I mean, didn't any&nbsp;of them go to elementary school and learn enough about grammar to know that the parts of speech hardly require a lifetime of study? Or if they had not been paying attention, h</FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>adn't they ever seen Schoolhouse Rock?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So I guess AP gets to be a step below our blonde heroine, who made an honest mistake between <STRONG>capitols</STRONG> and <STRONG>capitals</STRONG>. And at least she put a bit of effort into&nbsp;<EM>her</EM> blunder.</FONT></P>
<P><EM><FONT face=Tahoma><STRONG>Addendum 5:00pm: </STRONG>I was seeding in a mistake above for the sake of a post I was doing to do next week about word choices, but someone found it fast enough that I need to rethink the theory. Capitols are indeed in Capitals. :-)</FONT></EM></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But to use words stupidly in an obit for a linguist? Now <STRONG>that</STRONG> is chutzpah.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I won't say what part Associated Press was showing off this time, because it's one of those "words you aren't supposed to say in public" parts. If you know what I mean. :-)</FONT></P>

<p><a id="518808" href="#518808">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 28 Jan 2006 7:20 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">It is, and we look at it the same way (except when there is a spelling error, though apparently you can get high school students to make this mistake often!).<br><br>I was going to see if no one noticed and use the info for different post. Though I think you found it quickly enough to kill my theory. :-) </div>

You nearly tricked me into thinking that American English uses &quot;Capitol&quot;. You can't be sure about these things if you learned British English in school. (And German at home.)</div>

Kaplan</strong> on 29 Jan 2006 1:52 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Hi Sebastian,<br><br>That is the other reason I decided to rethink my plans -- I csnnot &quot;prove&quot; that people don't always distinguish if they do distinguish but assume it might be different somewhere else.<br><br>Maybe it's worth a post to describe the failed experiment in full! :-)</div>

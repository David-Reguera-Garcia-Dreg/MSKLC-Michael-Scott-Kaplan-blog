<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I took most of Friday off (I ended up putting in a few hours for a small keyboard snafu and answered a question or two while I was there, but otherwise it was a day off).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I decided to go and see a linguistics talk being given over at the University of Washington at their weekly colloquium.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The talk was about Cuzco </FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>Quechua, a language that has interested me since we added the following locales to windows XP SP2 (which I first mentioned a year ago in <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/01/26/360685.html"><STRONG>Lions and tigers and <STRIKE><FONT color=#a9a9a9>bears</FONT></STRIKE>ELKs, Oh my!</STRONG></A>):</FONT></P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT face="Courier New"><STRONG>0x046b&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quechua - Bolivia</STRONG></FONT> 
<LI><FONT face="Courier New"><STRONG>0x086b&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quechua - Ecuador</STRONG></FONT> 
<LI><FONT face="Courier New"><STRONG>0x0c6b&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quechua - Peru</STRONG></FONT></LI></UL>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The talk (given by Rachel Hastings, whose PhD is in fact also about Quechua!) </FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>was a very interesting report about investigating the Definiteness Effect in Cuzco&nbsp;Quechua, looking epecially at existential and possessive sentences. A</FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>side from a little bit of linguistic jargon in a few of the questions that people asked afterwards, I pretty much understood all of the things that were being said. I'm&nbsp;still not a linguist but I might have to upgrade that whole 'linguistic aptitude' thing from delusions to notions soon!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I'll probably talk more about Quechua some time soon, it is a very interesting language, somehing I thought even before Rachel proved it is true in more ways than I realized.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Anyway, I was talking to&nbsp;her after the&nbsp;presentation and was explaining about my interest in Quechua and other languages, getting into some of the language issues I had been working on lately. </FONT>S<FONT face=Tahoma>he was interested in the fact that we were supporting several locales covering the Quechua language, and I'll definitely try to get her on the Vista beta so she can see it right alongside all of the other languages (and maybe report if she sees any bugs!). It was cool making a language contact who is a linguist -- because no matter how helpful native speakers can be, someone who has done as much work as she has on the language? She&nbsp;has so much explicit knowledge that can be so helpful, it is amazing to meet such people....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Then listening to people after the talk, like the one who pointed out how much Quechua has in common with Turkish. How does stuff like <EM>that</EM> happen, anyway?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><EM>(A part of me wonders if I should think about going back to school, but I think I lack the discipline that it would take to do that. Perhaps I will look into taking a class next semester or something....)</EM></FONT></P><FONT face=Tahoma>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Then on my way out an undergrad stopped me and asked me if my name was Michael Kaplan. It turned out she had seen <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/12/14/503918.html">my Channel 9 video</A>! I am not sure why exactly,&nbsp;but that is still fairly cool when I think about it. I mean, I know that people who read here might know about it, some may even watch it. But total strangers who are studying linguistics&nbsp;wasting 30 minutes of their lives to see me blather? That is awesome for reasons that I probably won't analyze further.... :-)</FONT></P>

After all, Finnish-Hungarian-Turkish-Korean takes one nearly to the Bering Strait.<br>Other New World puzzles include the lotus flower motif and the funerary use of jade in Precolumbian Mexico. The question has always been whether this comes from recent (0-1500AD) transpacific contact or reflects a common ancient heritage. The Quechua-Turkish similarity might suggest the latter.</div>

It's conceivable that they spoke a Turkish language.<br><br>Alas, this group was eventually wiped out, but not before they wrote their history down on plates of gold... which were later discovered by the Prophet Joseph Smith.<br><br>I'll leave the plausibility of this theory to everyone's individual judgment ;)</div>

Linguists from Microsoft Research and from the Speech and Natural Language group collaborate with the UW linguistics dept to encourage contacts and dissemination of information.<br><br>Maybe I'll meet you there next week? (I'd be glad to)<br><br>best wishes,<br><br>Thierry<br><br>Thierry Fontenelle - MS Speech &amp; Natural Language<br><br></div>

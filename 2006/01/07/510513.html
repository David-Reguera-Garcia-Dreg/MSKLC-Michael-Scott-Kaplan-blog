<P><EM><FONT face=Tahoma>(Nothing technical in this post)</FONT></EM></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>There was a movie I was thinking about yesterday called <A href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0132512/">At First Sight</A>. It starred Val Kilmer and Mira Sorvino. Val plays Virgil, a blind man who has an operation to try to regain his sight. I had trouble (when I first saw&nbsp;the movie years ago)&nbsp;believing that someone who was blind would look at the blindness as an actual feature, as something that is a protection that is good to have.</FONT></P><FONT face=Tahoma>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>However, after two infusions of Novantrone,&nbsp;when I have lost many of my intermittent symptoms, I find myself missing some of them.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I mean, I missed that whole pain sensation thing and it was great to get it back, sure. But I didn't miss feeling the needle when they did the second infusion -- that hurt!</FONT></P>
<P>And I missed temperature sensation and loved that I could feel hot and cold again. But it's not summer right now and it would be nice not to feel it when I go out to get the mail or going to work.</P></FONT>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Another factor: there was a rerun of House on last week (episode name: TB or not TB) that I just got around to watching (I missed it the first time around).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>There was a scene at the end that kind of resonated with me, it went something like this:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT size=2><EM><STRONG>House:</STRONG> Everybody does it.&nbsp;We are who people think we are.&nbsp;People think he’s a great doctor so they give him stuff.</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><EM><STRONG>Cameron:</STRONG> He is a great doctor.</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><EM><STRONG>House:</STRONG> The reality is irrelevant.&nbsp;{House looks into the clinic and sees Cecelia sitting there.}&nbsp;I’ll prove it.&nbsp;People who know me see me as an ass, treat me as an ass.&nbsp;People who don’t know me see a cripple, treat me as a cripple.&nbsp;What kind of selfish jerk wouldn’t take advantage of that fact?&nbsp; {He enters the clinic, and walks by Cecelia, deliberately&nbsp;pressing his cane on her boot and putting his weight on it.}</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><EM><STRONG>Cecelia:</STRONG> Ow!</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><EM><STRONG>House:</STRONG> Oh, my goodness, are you okay?</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><EM><STRONG>Cecelia:</STRONG> Yeah.&nbsp; {Cuddy comes to her door.}</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><EM><STRONG>House:</STRONG> {exaggerated, toward Cuddy -- who he owed an apology from earlier} I am so sorry.&nbsp;It was completely my fault.</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><EM><STRONG>Cecelia:</STRONG> It’s nothing, I’m fine.</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><EM><STRONG>House:</STRONG> Well, I’m very relieved, I feel terrible.</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><EM><STRONG>Cecelia:</STRONG> Don’t worry about it, I’m fine.</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><EM><STRONG>House:</STRONG> You sure?&nbsp;Okay.&nbsp; {They shake hands.&nbsp;Cuddy and House make faces at each other.&nbsp;As House leaves, Cuddy walks through her office door to Cecelia.}</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><EM><STRONG>Cuddy:</STRONG> How’s everything?</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><EM><STRONG>Cecelia:</STRONG> I’m gonna go.&nbsp;My foot is killing me.</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><EM><STRONG>Cuddy:</STRONG> Oh, what did you do?</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><EM><STRONG>Cecelia:</STRONG> It was nothing, it was all my fault.&nbsp;{She leaves.}</EM></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Now I have not ever done anything like that intentionally (well, some people would say I am ass and they would also say it is intentional; I was talking about the cripple thing, and his little experiment).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I have done such things unintentionally, both with the cane and more recently&nbsp;with the scooter (in the case of the scooter it is usually somebody bumping into it while I am not moving). But there are a frightening number of times that it plays out just like it did in Dr. House's little experiment, with someone else claiming full responsibility for something, even if it was in no way their fault.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It is depressing to think that what House said is true -- that people who don't know me would see me as a cripple. But I can't deny that is usually seems to be the case.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I definitely don't want to take advantage of my MS -- either the symptoms or the perceptions that others have. But even if I am not trying to do so, I guess I am. Just by not being insistent on not being given special treatment (which people would look&nbsp;at in an even worse way, whether they knew me or not -- the appearance of being a bitter cripple would hardly be an improvement).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I was in the hospital overnight not too long ago, and I didn't end up calling someone who I was supposed to be calling that night (before i ended up in the hospital, I mean). I did call when i got out, and felt bad about it. I found myself resenting for a moment the fact that they assumed that I had ended up in the hospital. Even moreso because it was true, which is obviously a dumb reason to be mad about the fact that someone else was not mad because they correctly guessed at what had happened. I get dizzy trying to untangle how I should feel about that kind of situation....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I mean. how can any&nbsp;person&nbsp;get carried up two flights of stairs to watch a show and hang out with&nbsp;the performers after&nbsp;not feel like they are taking advantage? Although the one thing I do love (now that I think about it) is that of all the singer/songwriters I have met over the last few years, there is not a single one who ever treated me the way strangers do. As a group they have disproven Dr. House's theory and been just truly friendly people. I haven't fully analyzed that and probably won't since I think it's nice just to let it happen, but it is pretty cool.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Anyway, to the people who know me, definitely keep doing what you are doing and don't treat me any differently. I need you folks to make up for the&nbsp;people I don't know who aren't singer/songwriter types!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><EM>UNRELATED BONUS ASIDE:&nbsp;I have come up with a surefire way to make sure a television show gets killed off -- I just have to start trying to watch it live when it is on (this has now happened with both <STRONG>Threshold</STRONG>&nbsp;and <STRONG>Medical investigation</STRONG>). I suppose some folks in Hollywood could pay me to not watch their shows, or maybe to watch their competitors' shows instead? :-)</EM></FONT></P>

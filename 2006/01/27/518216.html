<P><FONT face=Tahoma>As you might imagine, these days I get a lot of email from people in different groups at Microsoft about all kinds of internationalization issues.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Usually they are polite, but some of them can be demanding at times!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Now </FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>while it is true that I have a lot of different things that I know something about, it is not like I know everything about every single issue.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Unfortunately, I usually do know the answer often enough that people keep on asking. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Anyway, yesterday someone was looking for a way to convert between Locale Identifiers (</FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>LCIDs) and culture names.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So I immediately suggested the NLS API functions <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/intl/nls_LocaleNameToLCID.asp">LocaleNameToLCID</A> and <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/intl/nls_LCIDToLocaleName.asp">LCIDToLocaleName</A>.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>"I'm sorry," they said. "We need something that works in managed code."</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Ah, that is even easier since the <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfSystemGlobalizationCultureInfoClassTopic.asp">CultureInfo class</A> has&nbsp;both <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfsystemglobalizationcultureinfoclassnametopic.asp">Name</A> and <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfsystemglobalizationcultureinfoclasslcidtopic.asp">LCID</A> properties.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>"Hmmm," they said. "We need something that will work downlevel."</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>No problem,&nbsp;since the .NET Framework can run as far downlevel as Windows 98 if needed.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>"Ah, but we have to handle custom locales, too," they offered.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>As you can imagine, I was getting a little exasperated by then. I pointed out that custom locales are a new feature in Vista, so there was no downlevel requiremnt for them.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>"No, we need to support all of these scenarios" was the response.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Hmmm.... so basically they need:</FONT></P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>both names and LCIDs</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>in both managed and unmanaged code</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>on Both Vista and downlevel</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>for both built-in and custom locales</FONT></LI></UL>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But they wanted to be "good citizens" and start using names and getting rid of their LCID dependency.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><EM>(of course in most societies the good citiziens would not be expected to be quite this demanding, but that is another story!)</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><STRONG>Well, I told them, they will probably need to store both names and LCIDs.</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>We simply were not able to know through special psychic powers that all these things would be needed to build such functionality into prior versions. Not that I would complain if I had this ability, but for the present it is simply beyond my power....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Anyway, I think when the extreme nature of their request was so baldly laid out, they kind of understood they were looking for a bit more than was possible. Which is not to say they won't be emailing me tomorrow to ask another question. :-)</FONT></P>

Welcome to corporate america.</div>

If they areabale to create then the locale works on the machine, so they can grab the two properties and store them.<br><br>And then everybody wins. :-)</div>

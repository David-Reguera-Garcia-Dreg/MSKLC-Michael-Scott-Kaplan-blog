<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Did you know that some of the graphics used in Windows are not actually graphics but are instead represented as symbols in a font?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It is true. And that font's name is Marlett. From its own description, as found&nbsp;in the TrueType <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/TrueTypeProperty21.mspx">Font Properties Extension</A> tool:</FONT></P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/MarlettProps.jpg"></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Looking at it in Character Map, you may see a few familiar UI elements from your Windows experience:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/MarlettXP.jpg"></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And although the file sometimes tries to hide itself, it is always there helping Windows have the right look and feel....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I find this font to be pretty cool, myself. Maybe we could get the Invisible Jet added! :-)</FONT></P>

Cool!<br></div>

Does Microsoft guarantee that it'll always be there and will always contain the same stuff at the same codepoints, or is this just a big, overly-visible implementation detail?<br><br>Also, does the Windows XP theme engine still use these symbols when it's drawing themed controls?</div>

This is both in the UI and when I just look at it in Character map, even though all the other fonts are being smoothed. Seems like it would have been cool if Marlett was smoothed, because you'd automatically get anti-aliased radio buttons and stuff :) But maybe it's ignored on purpose or something? Is that something any font author can do (say &quot;don't smooth my font&quot;) or is it special for Marlett?</div>

Kaplan</strong> on 26 Jan 2006 10:13 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Hi Dean --<br><br>It appears that ClearType is not applied to this font. There are some people looking into the issue now....<br><br>Another bug found through blogging? :-)</div>

If I look at the properties of a ttf font (inside and outside of the font folder), I have only the 3 default pages (general/security/summary).<br><br>You have a lot of font specific pages.<br><br>Steffen<br><br></div>

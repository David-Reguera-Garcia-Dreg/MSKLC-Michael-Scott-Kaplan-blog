<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It is indeed intentional, though not through an attempt on our part to be difficult. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It is actually a limitation in SGCAPS on Windows that we did not know about when MSKLC was first developed!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Early internal versions of MSKLC allowed SGCAPS to contain up to four characters, and also allowed an 'ALTGR SGCAPS' which gave two additional shift states. It was not until after testing the functionality we investigated and found that there was no way to represent these things in the created layout (at which point we had to take all that support out, unfortunately).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>In the end, MSKLC is designed to make what is possible much easier to do, rather than to make the impossible possible....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It is one of the possible things that we could look into adding in a future version, though of course that is an uphill battle since it would require work in both Windows and MSKLC, which is harder to coordinate, especially at a time where people are so focused on&nbsp;getting the next version of Windows ready to ship (the fact that SGCAPS as a feature is not the most intuitive thing in the world for most users is also a factor that makes this a more difficult addition to justify).</FONT></P>

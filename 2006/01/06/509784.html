<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I was reminded the other day of a scene from&nbsp;News Radio where a woman was telling David Foley about how "<EM>That's ironic. You know, like rain on your wedding day?</EM>", to which Dave replied "<EM>No, that's not ironic; that's unfortunate.</EM>"</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It&nbsp;also reminded me of the conversation about the difference between <STRONG>regular ironic</STRONG> and <STRONG>alanis ironic</STRONG> that it inspired&nbsp;with&nbsp;a linguist or two that I know.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It all came&nbsp;back to me&nbsp;when </FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>over in <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/fontblog/">fontblog</A>, I read as Kevin Larson <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/fontblog/509299.aspx">introduced the Irony Mark</A>.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Now although&nbsp;there is&nbsp;a French Wikipedia entry for <A href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_d'ironie">Point d'ironie</A>, I want to make sure everyone understands that we (Microsoft)&nbsp;don't add characters to Windows unless they are in characters that are in Unicode.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Of course&nbsp;that article suggests the possibility of using U+061f (ARABIC QUESTION MARK) for this character, but John Hudson points out in a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/fontblog/archive/2006/01/04/509299.aspx#509340">comment</A> to the fontblog post that this can cause other problems due to RtL and LtR context issues. Not to mention that it won't look like the character in question.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I just didn't want anyone to assume that there were random groups at Microsoft trying to introduce characters that were not in Unicode into our fonts -- because with the exception of the various symbol&nbsp;fonts (which use the Private Use Area), this is something that we try to stay out of as a company.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Even&nbsp;when we are&nbsp;talking about really important characters like&nbsp;Wonder Woman's&nbsp;INVISIBLE JET! :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma color=#ff1493><EM>This post of course brought to you by</EM> "<FONT size=6>؟</FONT>" <EM>(U+061f, a.k.a. ARABIC QUESTION MARK)</EM></FONT></P>

I've no idea why I did it, since of course I can't legally distribute it. Oh well. At least I have it on my computer, so I can feel better about using the symbols in it!<br></div>
<p><a id="510539" href="#510539">#</a> <strong>Gabe</strong> on 8 Jan 2006 3:52 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">That French Wikipedia article was pretty cool, if for no other reason than to see what the French call their punctuation.<br><br>For example, what we call a comma they call a virgule. This is interesting, because in English a virgule is a slash, and it turns out that a comma and a slash have common origins. The French word for slash is &quot;barre oblique&quot;, which I assume is basically just French for &quot;angled bar&quot;. A second instance of this sort of thing is that their name for a pilcrow (the backwards-P we use for a paragraph mark) is called &quot;pied de mouche&quot;, while the word &quot;paragraphe&quot; is used to describe the section mark (vertically stacked double-S).<br><br>Another interesting difference is that their bracket ([) is called a crochet. I thought it was odd that they would name a bracket after a method for fashioning afghans until I realized that crochet probably means &quot;hook&quot;.<br><br>The biggest thing I don't understand is that their braces ({}) are called &quot;accolades&quot;.<br><br>Only apostrophe, point (period), and prime (a tick mark) properly round-trip between English and French.</div>

There's a big difference between empty space and something that just *looks* like empty space...</div>

<h1>More on cursor support: half of the answer!</h1>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Ok, earlier today in the post <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/01/09/510654.html"><STRONG>More on cursor support: in Bidi, intuition can be a four letter word</STRONG></A>, I posted a problem. I have gotten some offline email and some guesses that gave as many as three non- contiguous selection areas, but no one who has yet come up with the solution....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So, to keep people looking and thinking, here is the string that allows for the five non-contiguous areas of selection in Notepad:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face=Tahoma color=#ff0000 size=5><SPAN dir=ltr>אבג123אבגABCאבג123אבג</SPAN></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Now you just have to figure how to get the non-contiguous selections to happen in Notepad!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>You can post answers if you want (I have marked this post to moderate all comments, so you won't spoil it for anyone by guessing there).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Good luck! :-)</FONT></P>

E.g. move cursor between the visually leftmost 1 and 2, hold shift and press the right-arrow 13 times and you get the 5 nonconsecutive selection highlights.</div>

Or do I not get the question? It works in the Explorer too with your text right there. I also found that on a machine where I have not installed extra language support it works in Explorer but not in Notepad.</div>

<p><a id="511024" href="#511024">#</a> <strong>Doug</strong> on Monday, January 09, 2006 7:53 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">I had three noncontiguous areas with only LTR and RTL characters (and you can't get more than that I believe), but I didn't realise that numbers were Bidi neutral. I've got it now, though :). Trying to select part of that text with the mouse to copy and paste it into Notepad really messes with your head!<br><br>On another note, it's an odd feeling for the right arrow key to move left through RTL characters, but it makes sense. Does this happen even in localised versions of Windows? In that case, if computers were first developed by people who wrote RTL, could we expect the left arrow to go right through English text?<br></div>

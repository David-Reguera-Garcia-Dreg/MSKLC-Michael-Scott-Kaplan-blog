<P><FONT face=Tahoma><EM>(Nothing technical in this post, sorry!)</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I have been getting some interesting email and other communication from people since I have talked about taking Novantrone.</FONT></P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Some of it is very supportive and talks about how they think I have a really positive attitude.</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Some of it is people who are worried, either for me or for someone they know in the same situation.</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>some of it is from people who are taking Novantrone or were taking it, with good results.</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>And some of it is&nbsp;from very unhappy people who know of really bad experiences with Novantrone.</FONT></LI></UL>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Now many of those people who think me being positive about it is misleading and evil. I won't post any of the ruder mails that fall into THAT category, but I'll post the most recent one from that fourth category:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face=times size=2><EM>I read your concerns about Novantrone.&nbsp; You are right to be worried about this drug.&nbsp; My daughter took Novantrone and ended up losing her once healthy heart.&nbsp; Her doctor failed to monitor her properly and the drug destroyed her heart.&nbsp; Doctors gave up on her and said that she would die because no one would give her a heart transplant because of her MS.&nbsp; For weeks she lay clinging to life until one very special hospital in North Carolina gave her heart transplant over a year ago. </EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=times size=2><EM>Her life has changed dramatically since the heart transplant.&nbsp; Currently, she takes numerous anti-rejection pills; she currently is fighting an episode of rejection.</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=times size=2><EM>Novantrone is too deadly for MS patients.&nbsp; It never helped her MS at all.</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=times size=2><EM>I really do not think MS patients understand how deadly this drug is. . . for more deadly that MS.&nbsp; Novantrone kills!</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=times size=2><EM>Think about what happened to my daughter before taking Novantrone.&nbsp; MS is bad; however, there is hope with MS.&nbsp; Novantrone kills.</EM></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>My heart definitely goes out to this woman's daughter, and I hope she is able to recover after the transplant.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Let me state for the record that I am not a doctor or a lawyer, but if a neurologist prescribed Novantrone and was not doing regular echocardiograms then&nbsp;someone should probably be seeing a lawyer, I know I would. Though of course it was less than a year ago that the recommendtions for regular echocardiograms were put in (and many insurance companies probably would have refused to pay for this "un-necessary test" before the change -- there is lots of evil to go around here)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But beyond that, I would not want anyone to read about my experiences and decide that they want to take Novantrone for their MS just because of my attitude or results. Because even if the doctors behave responsibly, it <STRONG>is</STRONG> a poison. That's its point. And if I had another, better choide, you can bet your ass I'd be taking it.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I am actually reminded of a scene from the movie <STRONG>The Paper</STRONG> that I saw again a few days ago on TV:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face=times size=2><EM><STRONG>Vitor Truro</STRONG>: Now don't overreact. If we go after it early, before it metastasizes to a bone, the majority of these prostate cancer cases are beatable. <BR><STRONG>Robert Duvall</STRONG>: Go after it how? <BR><STRONG>Vitor Truro</STRONG>: Irridation therapy. <BR><STRONG>Robert Duvall</STRONG>: That's fantastic. That's wonderful. Because... as it turns out, that's exactly the portion of my anatomy I'd like to see exposed to radiation. <BR><STRONG>Vitor Truro</STRONG>: You'll have to take an hour or two off work for each treatment. We should start right away. How's next monday? <BR><STRONG>Robert Duvall</STRONG>: To burn a hole in my ass? Sounds good. That way&nbsp;I still have the weekend. <BR>&lt;frustrated pause&gt;<BR><STRONG>Robert Duvall</STRONG>: Could you possibly be any more humourless about this? <BR><STRONG>Vitor Truro</STRONG>: I don't believe so. No. </EM></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Now we can laugh if Emo jokes about he bought his girlfriend something crazy and expensive that she didn't even need (he signed her up for radiation therapy). But we know that it is serious stuff, deep down. And Novantrone is a chemotherapy drug, and the only good thing that can be said about such a poison is that sometimes it brings a very targetted form of deadly to the mix.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>They did <A href="http://www.nationalmssociety.org/Clinup-Novantrone.asp">change the labelling last year</A> for a reason. And I don't plan to ignore that fact. </FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>I mean, I've been lucky so far. But if I get an echocardiogram that tells me anything even remotely negative, then I won't be in for that next infusion. My LVEF is&nbsp;about 75%&nbsp;right now, and if it starts going down I am not going to wait for it to go below 50% before I say farewell to the blue stuff. If you know what I mean. I may need that "good heart" later!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And my doctor knows that (I have made it very clear but I think she knew anyway, she knows me in&nbsp;serious situations like this one).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And if the Novantrone doesn't work out, I'll be sure to mention that too -- I am not shilling for the drug company on this one.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But for now (two doses in) things are still going okay (and it does appear to have helped with some transient symptoms). I'll stick with it until that changes or the course ends....</FONT></P>

<p><strong>Marie Arnold</strong> on 26 Oct 2007 7:00 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><P>My husband was on Novantrone from 2002 to 2004. I do not remember him having any echocardiograms, only blood tests. He was just diagnosed with congestive heart failure and had an ejection fracture of 10%. He may need a defibrulator implant. &nbsp;Novantrone didn't help the MS symptoms much either. &nbsp;It isn't worth the risk.</P></div>

<p>I'm curious about how you are doing now, 2 years later? &nbsp;My neuro just recommended Novantrone and I'm trying to find more real people who have had it. &nbsp;I hope you are well.</p></div>

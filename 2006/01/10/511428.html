<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Hugh just posted about the <A href="http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/002160.html">Top Ten Blogger Lies</A>.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Maybe they are lies when some people say these things, but I am struck by how true&nbsp;the statements all&nbsp;are, to me at least....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Here is the list. Hugh's comments are struck out gray and mine are RED.</FONT></P><FONT face=Tahoma>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><STRONG>1. I don't consider myself an A-Lister.</STRONG></P>
<P><FONT color=#808080 size=2><STRIKE>No, but I turn up for speaking gigs at all the big conferences anyway. Uh-huh.</STRIKE></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000 size=2>I am an expert in an area with a very narrow draw and definitely&nbsp;do not think&nbsp;I am on the blogger A-List.</FONT></P>
<P><STRONG>2. I don't care about traffic.</STRONG></P>
<P><FONT color=#808080 size=2><STRIKE>Of course I don't. Even though I'm a freelance consultant, and my blog is my primary way of marketing myself. Rock on.</STRIKE></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000 size=2>I&nbsp;do not&nbsp;freelance&nbsp;and I am not a&nbsp;consultant. And I can't imagine anyone hiring me based on this blog who I would truly be happy working for. Sorry!</FONT></P>
<P><STRONG>3. I've read your blog.</STRONG></P>
<P><FONT color=#808080 size=2><STRIKE>Yeah, well I read the "Musings of an unemployed tech consultant" bit on the title bar, before clicking off. That counts.</STRIKE></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000 size=2>When I say I have read it, I have. It is too easy to get caught in that lie so it is much better not to tell it. It is not embarrassing to not have read it yet. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><STRONG>4. I started blogging back in 1999.</STRONG></P>
<P><FONT color=#808080 size=2><STRIKE>Of course, back in 1999 a Flash-animated, brochureware homepage was considered a blog. Kinda sorta.</STRIKE></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000 size=2>I wouldn't say this since I wasn't. Easy.</FONT></P>
<P><STRONG>5. My blog has no commercial agenda.</STRONG></P>
<P><FONT color=#808080 size=2><STRIKE>I'm far too sexy to care about money. Exactly.</STRIKE></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000 size=2>I am in no way sexy but I make no money off this blog anyway -- so commercial interests here are generally not mine. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><STRONG>6. I only have advertising on my blog as an experiment.</STRONG></P>
<P><FONT color=#808080 size=2><STRIKE>That explains why the adstrip is right under the "Musings of an unemployed tech consultant" bit. Indeed.</STRIKE></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000 size=2>No ads here, at least nothing I make money off of....</FONT></P>
<P><STRONG>7. I've never liked the unegalitarian term, "A-Lister".</STRONG></P>
<P><FONT color=#808080 size=2><STRIKE>Even though I am one. Oh, the irony.</STRIKE></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000 size=2>Well, I am not one (see #1), and I think the term is fine if you are someone everyone reads. Rock on!</FONT></P>
<P><STRONG>8. I'm proud to be a D-Lister.</STRONG></P>
<P><FONT color=#808080 size=2><STRIKE>Even though I spend 7 hours a day writing the thing. Right.</STRIKE></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000 size=2>Well, I don't spend&nbsp;that many&nbsp;hours a day --&nbsp; I actually do not spend too much time at all. It's probably why the quality is what it is. Not sure I know the "D-Lister criteria" to know if that is something I'd say, though....</FONT></P>
<P><STRONG>9. He's a big hero of mine.</STRONG></P>
<P><FONT color=#808080 size=2><STRIKE>He's got more traffic than downtown Mexico City and I'm hoping to God he links to me one day.</STRIKE></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000 size=2>I am flattered when people like <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/OldNewThing/default.aspx">Raymond Chen</A> or <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/LarryOsterman/default.aspx">Larry Osterman</A> link to me, but they&nbsp;were heroes of mine long before I blogged so that's no great shakes. But I don't say it to get links; its better if they link to stuff that interests them!</FONT></P>
<P><STRONG>10. I really admire what she's doing for the blogosphere.</STRONG></P>
<P><FONT color=#808080 size=2><STRIKE>I've noticed that she's currently single.</STRIKE></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><FONT color=#ff0000>I link to several different women but I cannot imagine ever using that as a way to meet people. </FONT><FONT color=#ff0000>This applies to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/BetsyA/default.aspx">Betsy</A>, <A href="http://www.dasblonde.net/">Michele</A>, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/SuzCook/default.aspx">Suzanne</A>,&nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jfoscoding/default.aspx">Jessica</A>, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/SaraFord/default.aspx">Sara</A>, <A href="http://www.gregcons.com/kateblog/default.aspx">Kate</A>, <A href="http://www.shutuplaura.com/">Laura</A>, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jobsblog/default.aspx">Gretchen</A>, <A href="http://www.thedatafarm.com/blog/default.aspx">Julie</A>, <A href="http://abecedaria.blogspot.com/">Suzanne</A>&nbsp;(the other Suzanne!), <A href="http://www.sqlskills.com/blogs/kimberly">Kimberly</A>, and any other blog I&nbsp;subscribe to&nbsp;that is written by someone who happens to be female. I don't judge according to split-tail-edness. :-)</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000 size=2>On a side note, my only ever relationship that came out of anything online crashed and burned hard enough that if "she is currently single" then it ain't gonna get me trying to affect that status....</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE></FONT>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It might just be me, but it looks like I can make (and mostly have made!) every one of these statements and not lied&nbsp;to say&nbsp;any of them.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So welcome to <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/default.aspx">Sorting It All Out</A>, where lies come to rehabilitate themselves!</FONT></P></STRIKE></FONT>

A friend of mine (a translator) used to proof-read his text under MSDOS by holding down the PageDown key and letting the pages flash before his eyes: in the fraction of a second that each page lasted, there was no time to read anything... but a misspelt word would jump out at him.<br><br>PS - you may enjoy the link in the &quot;My URL&quot; field.<br><br>--------------------<br><br>Disclaimer: the opinions expressed in this posting are not necessarily those of the author.</div>

I thought I was the only one to do this. I have some sort of built-in spellchecker. If I see a page, then instantly any spelling errors jump out at me in bold.<br><br>l33t-sp34k drives me nuts, even though I think it's funny. So do people in AIM that can't type and/or spell... enough that I won't talk to them.</div>

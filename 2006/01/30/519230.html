<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=2><em>Sometimes (e.g. in journals) Cyrillic/Greek letters are used in proper names. The sorting order then becomes somewhat complicated. Are systems giving results like the following in use? Are there any (relatively) widespread standards?</em></font></p>

<p><font face=Tahoma>This type of 'integrated multilingual sort' is not something that is directly supported by Windows and would require a massive reassignment of all weights to work properly.</font></p>
<p><font face=Tahoma>It is also not generally expected by users who I have spoken with, though. And has not really come up as a frequent request.</font></p>
<p><font face=Tahoma>Of course if one is trying to support such a sort, the easiest way to do it would be to keep for each entry a separate transliterated name, perhaps using the new <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/tools/translit.mspx">Microsoft Transliteration Tool</a>! :-) , and then with all of the strings on the level playing field of the same script you could simply sort by those entries to integrate the sort.</font></p>
<p><font face=Tahoma>But it is a specialty usage, not one that would expected in everyday sorting....</font></p>

Or the list of 'languages in menus and dialogs' in the regional options CPL).</div>

What I am getting in Outlook Newsgator now are RSS feeds that refeed a long list of previous entries, but with no content whatsoever, just a link to the default blog page.  They all seem to have the timestamp of when I did the download (around 7am today).<br/><br/>In your case, the other thing I notice is that the name on the feed changed from "Sorting It All Out" to "mitchcap."<br/><br/>The oldest article that was refed (that is, obliterated depending on how a feed reader matches it to the previous post) has title "Invariant is a really good choice ... ."<br/><br/>The other blogs where I have noticed this so far are "Gianpaolo's blog" and "Dan Fernandez's blog."  <br/><br/>I'll see who I can get an e-mail to about this too.</div>

Dang.</div>

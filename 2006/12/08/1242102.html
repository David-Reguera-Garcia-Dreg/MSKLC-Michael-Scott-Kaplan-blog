<hr/> <!-- Archival Source: ProcessPostOld -->
<P>I bought a <A class="" href="http://www.zune.net/" mce_href="http://www.zune.net/">Zune</A> the other day.</P>
<P>This is something of a departure for me, as I have not&nbsp;bought a portable music player smaller than a Tablet or laptop since the Walkman I picked up over two decades ago. And generally speaking I don't go for the latest entertainment devices, something that has been true since I bought an Atari 5200 around the time I bought that Walkman.</P>
<P>But I figured what the hell, I'd go to the MS Company Store and pick one up. :-)</P>
<P>I bought a white one, which is (according to Carolyn) the least cool of the three colors. But I never claimed to be cool, so that was no problem.</P>
<P>So I set up my new cool Zune.</P>
<P>I found that I was quite happy with the sound quality and especially happy that I was able to sync the over 25gb of music from my Lattitude D820 and still have enough room for all eight episodes of Love Monkey in WMV format.</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/zune01.png"></P>
<P><EM>(that would be Paul Bryan and&nbsp;Aimee Mann from the episode entitled <STRONG>The One That Got Away</STRONG>)</EM></P>
<P>But I admit I was a little bit less happy when I scrolled through those many gigabytes of music.</P>
<P>As you can imagine, I have lots of music on my machine that is imported from other countries, and lots of that music is not in English.</P>
<P>It was very cool to see it in the Zune app on my laptop:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/zune02.png"></P>
<P>It even included my humorous playlists!&nbsp;</P>
<P>On the other hand, it was&nbsp;decidely doubleplusuncool to see what it looked like on the device:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/zune03.png"></P>
<P>Hmmmm. Well, I guess I have to install some fonts. I better go find out how....</P>
<P>But I find article 928210 in the MS Knowledge Base (<A class="" href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/928210/en-us?sd=zune" mce_href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/928210/en-us?sd=zune">Boxes (□) or other characters appear instead of letters in the name of a song or an album when you browse for music on your Zune device</A>) which confirms my diagnosis with some decidely un-international text:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P mce_keep="true"><EM>CAUSE</EM></P>
<P><EM>This behavior occurs when the name of the media contains characters that are not part of the United States English (en-us) font that is installed on the Zune device. </EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P mce_keep="true">followed by a suggested seven step workaround, step #6 of which is:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P mce_keep="true">Modify the album name or the song name so that it contains U.S. characters to help you identify it.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P mce_keep="true">Hmmm.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">I asked around and nobody had any advice on installing some more fonts. :-(&nbsp;</P>
<P mce_keep="true">What are we republicans that we assume that US text == English text? Grrr.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">Well, I am not going to return my Zune. But the behavior as well as the text of the KB article (which does not even put in the text that this is a bug) are bad enough that the Zune makes it to the Unicode Lame List of What's [Internationally] Weak this week....</P>

Just the fact that it's not a PlaysForSure device sits strangely for me.</p>
<p>This lack of international support is a strange one, though. Especially since it can obviously SUPPORT it, it just doesn't &quot;support&quot; it...</p>
<p>Apparently, the release dates anywhere outside the U.S. are still all &quot;Unknown&quot; so I guess they have plenty of time to fix it...</p></div>

Any files with non-ASCII characters in the filename can't be recognized at all.

<P>Zune team won't let us talk about the future plans, but the fonts used on the V1. are Convection UI (XBox 360 UI font that includes Greek) and a new narrow version of Convection UI with a smaller character set (read no Greek). See <A href="http://www.ascendercorp.com/portfolio_custom.html" target=_new rel=nofollow>http://www.ascendercorp.com/portfolio_custom.html</A></P>
<P>Subsetting the fonts to the same char set may have been sensible for support reasons, but I think its important to remember that this is a V1. and that the PMC supported a larger char-set. </P>
<P>Cheers, Si </P></div>

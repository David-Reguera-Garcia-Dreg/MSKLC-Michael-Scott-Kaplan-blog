<h1>Thumb twiddling?</h1>

<P>I feel like I have been lax on the blog lately, not putting as much time into it as I usually do.</P>
<P>But then, there was this whole problem with the windstorm and the power outage. And that put my work behind a few days.</P>
<P>And work has also been busy.&nbsp;I'll give you a hint about what I have been working on....</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/msklc14_1.png"></P>
<P>Or perhaps another hint?</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/msklc14_2.png"></P>
<P>I think there might be a few regular readers who might be excited about this? :-)</P>
<P>I feel like a typical Microsoft product -- the installation package for MSKLC 1.4 is more than twice the size of the the one for 1.3, and the setup packages it creates are now more than ten times larger.</P>
<P>But there is a price that had to be paid to get in the fixes for <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/06/27/648618.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/06/27/648618.html">this problem</A></STRONG> and <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/06/27/648723.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/06/27/648723.html">this problem</A></STRONG> and especially <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/01/26/517728.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/01/26/517728.html">this problem</A></STRONG>. So at the end of the day, I think it will be mostly thought of as a fair trade-off.</P>
<P>Then there is a setup question I have for the people who&nbsp;pay&nbsp;attention to&nbsp;details about such things&nbsp;-- I wonder whether I should include the validation table in them or not. As I have mentioned <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/10/08/478479.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/10/08/478479.html">before</A></STRONG>, some people have noticed validation in Orca fails, though fewer than 5% of them noticed why. Of course adding that table will make things a little bigger still. Maybe it should just be an option or something?</P>
<P>In any case, just so people don't think I have been twiddling my thumbs or anything. :-)</P>

<h1>Hurry up and make it slower, already!</h1>

<P>Some people go crazy about performance -- they want everything to work as fast as possible. But there have been a few projects over the years where great performance actually worked against the interests of the project!</P>
<P>I suppose the first time I remember seeing it (not in a project I worked on but that I used) would be the Windows Solitaire game. Whereas winning used to cause an amusing card bounce effect, the faster CPU speeds turned it into something else thst was frankly just weird. But looking to stuff I actually was involved with....</P>
<P>One of these projects (which I hinted about long ago in <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/03/12/394420.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/03/12/394420.html"><STRONG>Performance gains at the cost of your own components</STRONG></A>)&nbsp;was the rewrite of the Security Wizard that was done in Access 2000. </P>
<P>You see, the old wizard was literally creating a new database and copying all of the objects into it. The copying obviously took some time, especially on large projects. But then&nbsp;we discovered that it was possible to change the workgroup ID of a database (which was the principal reason for the old mechanism of creating the new file, due to the conventional wisdom that the WID could not be modified).</P>
<P>The first prototype of the updated wizard was a beautiful design, right down to the Office 97 clip-art stick figures I used for the per-page graphics that caused real amusement at the demo!</P>
<P>But it had one terrible flaw.</P>
<P>You see, the DAO code that literally ran through every object, cleared its security attributes, and defined the new ones was so fast hitting the Finish button did not lead to a long enough pause to allow the user to think anything happened. And believe me, one time that you really don't want people to think that you didn't do the job is when you are securing something. The great performance led to a less satisfactory experience for the user!</P>
<P>It is actually just one of those real world "UI on top of an algorithm" issues one has to keep in mind -- that the ideal customer experience requires something to take just long enough for it it be plausible that the job was done.</P>
<P>And no longer, of course. Can't keep people waiting! :-)</P>
<P>The issue has come up many other times in UI pieces I have worked on -- the Partial Replica Wizard, the validation step in the Keyboard Layout Creator, and more -- all times where the tight, fast code actually worked against customer satisfaction....</P>

People were used to having a window where the could stop a message from being sent in MSMail. That window narrowed to something less than humanly-possible reaction time when Exchange was rolled out (barring any network problems). I &nbsp;created an extension that would slap a 'send mail in X seconds' property on all outgoing email. It took the Outlook team several years to replicate that simple feature...</p></div>

<p>In a way, this is the converse of the need for an &quot;I'm busy&quot; icon when the algorithm takes a while to respond, but both cases address the same human need -- to have a warm fuzzy feeling that the machine is actually doing (or has actually done) what you asked it to do.</p></div>

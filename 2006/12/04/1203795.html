<P>There is a <A class="" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sqlclr" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sqlclr">SQL Server 2005/CLR integration</A> blog. </P>
<P>I find this fact impressive, because it means there is a team of people who are working on the difficult and thorny problem of getting these two very different technologies working together.</P>
<P>They have their work cut out for them, if you ask me. </P>
<P>I&nbsp;mean, just speaking from the standpoint of internationalization and focusing in particular on locales and collation, there are a ton of things that simply don't match.</P>
<P>Like when Aldo Donetti asked me:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT face="Times New Roman,Times" size=2><I>
<P>HI Michael, I’d have to figure out what’s the best collation to match the OS comparison behavior – would you have any clue?<BR><BR>The problem is that one of our teams is storing a path\filename in a table and of course we are clashing with collation issues, since there seem to be none that matches the OS’ file system. <BR><BR>I think it should be something like OrdinalIgnoreCase …</P></I></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Indeed, OrdinalIgnoreCase, as I have discussed <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/08/12/696284.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/08/12/696284.html"><STRONG>previously</STRONG></A>, is designed for exactly that purpose -- to match the OS notion of handling symbolic identifiers that amounts to an "uppercase and then binary compare" semantic. And SQL Server has nothing like it, unfortunately.</P>
<P>Each potential solution has its own problems, and over the next few days I'll try to cover the issues and problems that come up with each approach....</P>

<h1>Update on the update to the update for Romanian and Bulgarian</h1>

<p>I heard from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.secarica.ro/">Cristian Secară</a> from Romania again not too long ago:</p> <blockquote><font face="Times New Roman,Times"> <p><font size="1">Hi Michael, <br><br>First: thank you for your feedback regarding the Windows Keyboard Layouts page (</font><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/11/05/981537.html"><strong><font size="1">your blog</font></strong></a><font size="1"> on 05 November). <br><br>Second: Tudor pointed me out, and then read on your blog (</font><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/11/19/1104093.html"><strong><font size="1">your blog</font></strong></a><font size="1"> on 19 November) about the European Union Expansion Font Update for Romanian and Bulgarian. One thing I want to add here: although the covered fonts are ok for physical written documents (and thanks to MS for that !), there is at least one more important font required here: Verdana. This is required for virtual written documents (i.e. internet). Just from the early days of RC 1 beta testing I encountered discussions on forums, where some are saying something like "hey, look, Vista has the new keyboard layout included, I am using it right now !", while the answer was something like "hey, stop using it, we have difficulties in reading your post". Why ? Because the originator used Vista to write his post and the reader was on XP, so the <font face="Tahoma">ș</font> and <font face="Tahoma">ț</font> appeared as blank squares to the reader.<br><br>There is nothing unexpected about that user behaviour giving the existing situaton, but if a font update&nbsp; is on the way already, why then not complete the picture starting from right now ? <br><br>Some points here (my own speculations):</font></p> <ul> <li><font size="1">it may be important that existing XP users will not be disapointed about the new Vista, just because one single important font update is missing; I mean if the average XP user without much knowledge will see blank squares in messages written by Vista enthusiasts, they may have a bad influence in convincing others that Vista has "problems" with the Romanian language; again, in short term this may be an expected behaviour, but why not complete the fix if the fix has been already<br>started in some way ? </font> <li><font size="1">it would be fine if Verdana is updated, because this can lead to write and read pages in correct Romanian as quick as possible; I know&nbsp;this will be a long process (months/years), but why not start from right now ? </font></li></ul> <p><font size="1">Verdana is the most used font for web pages, at least, today in XP. I consider an update to this font to be equal in importance like the Arial and Times New Roman requested by EU. I am speaking for Romanian, I don't know what font the Bulgarian sites uses for most ... <br><br>Cristi </font></p> <p><font size="1">PS: I told to Tudor that the minimum font update should be Arial, Courier New, Times New Roman and Verdana, perhaps Georgia too; but I can live for now just with Arial, Times New Roman and Verdana update :) <br><br>-- <br></font><a href="http://www.secarica.ro/"><font size="1">Cristian Secară</font></a></p></font></blockquote> <p>Well,&nbsp;I suppose I&nbsp;could claim that as soon as I connected with Judy&nbsp;of the Microsoft Typography PM team that my extensive authority&nbsp;and influence led to everyone dropping what they were working on and providing an update to the update to include Verdana.</p> <p>In truth, when I mentioned this mail to her, she let me know that they were already working&nbsp;to update the update to include Verdana. </p> <p>And it is now available!</p> <p>You can check out the updated&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=0ec6f335-c3de-44c5-a13d-a1e7cea5ddea&amp;DisplayLang=en">European Union Expansion Font Update</a>&nbsp;(which still has neither <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=0ec6f335-c3de-44c5-a13d-a1e7cea5ddea&amp;DisplayLang=ro">Romanian</a>&nbsp;nor <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=0ec6f335-c3de-44c5-a13d-a1e7cea5ddea&amp;DisplayLang=bg">Bulgarian</a>&nbsp;translations of the download page available but I continue to hope for the future!), a download that not only includes</p> <blockquote> <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="5">Times New Roman (regular ȘșȚțЍѝ, <strong>bold ȘșȚțЍѝ</strong>, <em>italic ȘșȚțЍѝ</em>, and <strong><em>bold italic ȘșȚțЍѝ</em></strong>)</font></p></blockquote> <p>and</p> <blockquote> <p><font face="Arial" size="5">Arial (regular ȘșȚțЍѝ, <strong>bold ȘșȚțЍѝ</strong>, <em>italic ȘșȚțЍѝ</em>, and <strong><em>bold italic ȘșȚțЍѝ</em></strong>)</font></p></blockquote> <p>but now also includes</p> <blockquote> <p><font face="Verdana" size="5">Verdana (regular ȘșȚțЍѝ, <strong>bold ȘșȚțЍѝ</strong>, <em>italic ȘșȚțЍѝ</em>, and <strong><em>bold italic ȘșȚțЍѝ</em></strong>)</font></p></blockquote> <p>Enjoy!</p> <p>(I still owe several posts here about the Romanian letters and keyboards,&nbsp;and will be getting to them soon!)</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><font color="#ff00ff"><em>This post brought to you by</em> <font face="Tahoma" size="6">Ș</font>&nbsp;<em>(<a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0218">U+0218</a>, a.k.a.

<p>This is the Vista version of the font family, plus the missing Romanian characters which were *not* in the Vista version - hence the package now being kind of useful on Vista. </p></div>

<p>The fonts included in the update for Romanian and Bulgarian are the XP ones with six glyphs added, NOT the Vista ones. The Vista fonts have all the required glyphs already, at least the ones for Latin languages (I don't know how to name them, I mean not the ones for Arabic, for example).</p>
<p>One proof for this is that the XP fonts have the glyphs for U+0162 and U+0163 with cedilla below (which is wrong and caused a whole bunch of confusions over time), whereas the Vista fonts have the glyphs with comma below (which is correct, finally). The XP-like glyphs are still present in the font update.</p>

<p>Um. Yes, you are right: Verdana from the fonts update is the same as the Vista one + the two additional characters required for Bulgarian.</p>
<p>Therefore, we have here a BIG problem: (1) the Verdana font delivered with Vista misses the glyphs for U+040D and U+045D; (2) the font update is claimed to be Vista compliant; (3) the Arial and Times New Roman from the font update are the XP ones, with 6 more glyphs; (4) the Arial and Times New Roman from Vista contains approx double number of included glyphs.</p>
<p>In order for a Bulgarian Vista user to benefit from the updated Verdana font, in case of installing the package &quot;as is&quot;, that user will effectively downgrade its Arial and Times New Roman fonts !</p>
<p>A workaround may be to extract only the Verdana family from the font update and overwrite by hand the four Verdana .ttf files on Vista system (and then reboot). But, hmm ...</p>
<p>Any comment here Michael ?</p>

<P>The question that came in was:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><EM><FONT face="times new roman,times">Hello All,<BR><BR>Does anyone tell me how to turn off advanced text services in Windows Vista?</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>It's funny but I feel like I have spent nearly 50 years this past half decade answering the opposite question -- how to make sure that advanced text services were turned on, and how to make sure that their functionality was extended to all programs....</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/TextServicesXP.png"></P>
<P>In the end, the answer was that this was user selectable and quite easy to turn off both features -- just uncheck the top box and check the bottom one (obviously you can't check both of them since extending the support of something that is turned off just doesn't make a whole lot of sense -- <STRONG>extensibly non-functional</STRONG>? Not as pithy of an oxymoron as other common ones like <STRONG>thunderous silence</STRONG> or <STRONG>military intelligence</STRONG> or <STRONG>girlie man</STRONG>, but still kind of fun.</P>
<P>Now to get to this latest question how to turn off this functionality in Vista), the answer is <STRONG>you can't</STRONG>. The new dialog gives you many choices:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/TextServicesVista.png"></P>
<P>But there is no choice to turn it off. Which I am personally quite happy about, not just for the sake of all of those developers and ISVs who needed to have the support on for work they were doing or their apps were, but also for the sake of the many languages in Vista that you would not be able to type in at all with this support turned off.</P>
<P>So just like the <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/10/10/813347.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/10/10/813347.html">fonts that people can count on being there</A></STRONG> and the old "feature" of <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/05/27/422458.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/05/27/422458.html">optional NLS support going away</A></STRONG>, Vista is stopping a lot of this "stunt language functionality" nonsense. Which is a good thing....</P>
<P>So, I guess you could say that not only is advanced text services in Vista a turn on, but you can also say that now that this sassy little feature is so exciting and excitable&nbsp;that it will never be a turn off! :-)</P>

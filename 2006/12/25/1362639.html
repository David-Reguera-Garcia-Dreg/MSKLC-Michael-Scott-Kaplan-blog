<h1>Anyone out there switching modes in JIS?</h1>

<P>The report was that a specific sequence of bytes was failing conversion via code page 50220 to Unicode when using <A class="" href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms886760.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms886760.aspx">MultiByteToWideChar</A> but succeeding when using <A class="" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/misc/mlang/mlang.asp" mce_href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/misc/mlang/mlang.asp">MLang</A>. The bug only repros on XP (in Server 2003) the conversion was working in both technologies.</P>
<P>Now as I pointed out in <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/07/26/443375.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/07/26/443375.html"><STRONG>All code page architectures are created equal</STRONG></A>, some really are more equal than others. So let's take a look at this "MLang being more equal than Win32 on XP" case, shall we?</P>
<P>An excerpt of the byte sequence that shows the problem is:</P>
<P><FONT face="consolas,lucida console,courier new,courier"><STRONG>1B 24 42 2D 21 2D 22 2D 23 2D 24 2D 25 2D 26 2D 27 2D 28 2D 29 2D 2A 1B 28 4A 1B 24 42 2D 2B 2D 2C</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P>Breaking it down a bit:</P>
<P><FONT face="consolas,lucida console,courier new,courier"><STRONG><FONT color=#ff00ff>1B 24 42</FONT> 2D 21 2D 22 2D 23 2D 24 2D 25 2D 26 2D 27 2D 28 2D 29 2D 2A <FONT color=#00ff00>1B 28 4A</FONT> <FONT color=#ff0000>1B 24 42</FONT> 2D 2B 2D 2C</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P mce_keep="true">Now you will notice that the sequence in pink and the later one in red are the same. Yung-Shin did an analysis of what was going on:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P mce_keep="true"><EM><FONT face="times new roman,times">The 3-byte escape sequence in&nbsp;pink switches the mode to JIS X 0208-1983 mode, and two additional 3-byte sequence (1b, 28, 4a and 1b, 24, 42) switches the mode to JIS-Roman and back to JIS mode X 0208-1983 again.&nbsp; This is actually unnecessary because itâ€™s already in JIS mode already.&nbsp; However, in XP, these bogus escape sequence causes it to exit the loop and returns from the MB2WC call.&nbsp; In a word, if bogus escape sequence like this, the bogus sequence will truncate from the bogus escape sequence.&nbsp; If there are no bogus escape sequence (i.e. removing the red bytes), XP will convert the string just fine.<BR><BR>This bug is fixed in Server from <A class="" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/shawnste" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/shawnste">Shawn</A> by continuing the loop so its mode is switched correctly.</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P mce_keep="true">Now I write blog posts in tools that have no problem inserting HTML like </P>
<P mce_keep="true"><FONT face="consolas,lucida console,courier new,courier">&lt;font face=Tahoma&gt;Hello <STRONG><FONT color=#ff0000>&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face=Tahoma&gt;</FONT></STRONG>Dolly!&lt;/font&gt;</FONT></P>
<P mce_keep="true">(note the completely bogus bit converting out of and right back into the exact same font in red)</P>
<P mce_keep="true">So I can believe there might indeed be editing tools that might do the same thing with encodings that use escape sequences to switch in and out of different modes.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">The file itself that containing the errant sequences may well have just been set up to test the specific case, so it may or may not be proof of a real need to do something better here in XP.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">But I was wondering if anyone out there had run into this specific bug before, and whether it was blocking them (because writing code to prefilter the bytes would actually be quite a pain to do for obvious reasons).</P>
<P mce_keep="true">So, is there anyone using ISO 2022 code pages running into this problem?</P>
<P mce_keep="true">&nbsp;</P>
<P mce_keep="true"><FONT color=#ff00ff><EM>This post brought to you by <A class="" href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/000e" mce_href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/000e">U+000e</A> and <A class="" href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/000f" mce_href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/000f">U+000f</A> (a.k.a.

<p>When converting from unicode to ISO2022 </p>
<p>MLANG will issue a final shift sequence back to JIS roman.</p>
<p>WIN32 (MultiByteToWideChar) will not.</p>
<p>Also there are discrepancies in the conversion tables between MLANG and WIN32. </p>
<p>U+2172 (small roman numeral three) has differing encodings; in fact they use different shift sequences.</p>
<p>There are more discrepancies that cause severe issues when SEARCHING ISO2022 text for expressions.</p>
<p>Beacuse it depends what API the program used to serialize the data.</p>

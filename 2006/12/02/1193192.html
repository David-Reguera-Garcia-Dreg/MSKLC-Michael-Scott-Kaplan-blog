<h1>Enhancing language 'artificially' ?</h1>

<p>So yesterday, the question that was asked on an internal blogging alias:</p> <blockquote><font face="Times New Roman,Times"> <p>Yesterday, I have installed Windows Vista and observed <u>“Windows Checks”</u> during installation.<br><br>My question here is &nbsp;as per English Grammar <br><br>“The <i>third person singular</i> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_verb">regular verbs</a> in English is distinguished by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affix">suffix</a> <i>-s</i>.<br><br>If the base ends in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sibilant">sibilant</a> sound like /s/, /z/, /ʃ/, /tʃ/ (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet_for_English">IPA</a>) that is not followed by a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_E">silent E</a>, the suffix is written –es.<br><br>If the base ends in a consonant plus <i>y</i>, the <i>y</i> changes to an <i>i</i> and <i>-es</i> is affixed to the end.”<br><br>I think, The word “Windows” is not singular, as a result it should be <u>“</u><u>Windows Check</u><u>”</u> or <u>“</u><u>Window Checks”</u>, can anybody give me interpretation why the word “Windows” is used a <i>singular here?<br><br></i><i>Thanks</i></p></font></blockquote> <p>Not sure what that has to do with blogging, but.... :-)</p> <p>A few people pointed out that since <strong>Windows</strong> in this context is referring to&nbsp;a software product, it is a singular, proper noun. Which it is here, and it is why the usage was actually correct.</p> <p>Of course Windows is pretty ubiquitous now, but obviously that wasn't always the case. Which got me wondering about this kind of usage and how it would be interpreted by someone who was either unaware of this other status or who was simply less aware of it. You know, like someone who was not really hearing all that much about Windows the software product.</p> <p>Is this a usage that leads to&nbsp;a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_Path_Sentence">garden path sentence</a>? A slightly more conventional one even than the ones I have discussed previously like <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/07/23/675957.html"><strong>garden path menus</strong></a> and <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/10/16/833414.html"><strong>garden path blog post titles</strong></a>?</p> <p>Again it does not seem necessarily fit the textbook definition of a garden path sentence that a psycholinguist might use, despite the obvious similarities. But at least the garden path effect seems to be involved....</p> <p>Now coming back to the present where everyone knows what Windows is and the confusion is much less common, it seems easier to get the effect by using the word to <em>not</em> mean the software product and cause the backtracking to happen. </p> <p>And obviously someone who speaks no English will never have the ambiguity at all.</p> <p>But I can't help looking at this principle of Microsoft product names (Windows, Access, Excel, Outlook, etc.) based on generic words and feeling like this is a very artificial and fast process compared to the way words usually tend to shift in language. It just doesn't seem to take as long to change the meaning as it might have used to have taken. Sure things catch on, but do they really catch on this quickly under normal circumstances?</p> <p>So I wondered whether this is something that a linguist has studied, or maybe even written a dissertation on. It seems like a fascinating thing to be happening in language....</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><font color="#ff0080"><em>This post brought to you by</em>&nbsp;<font size="5">©</font> <em>(<a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/00a9">U+00a9</a>, a.k.a.

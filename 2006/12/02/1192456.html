<P>The question that came up the other day from Tom: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Is there a Tifinagh keyboard layout for Vista?&nbsp; I was wanting to make one for OS X but have had a hard time finding a model.<BR>Thanks.&nbsp;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Well, good to know that people are planning on putting Vista to good use. I wonder what the spin would be for those "I'm a Mac, I'm a PC" commercials? :-) 
<P>To answer the question, there isn't a layout for Tifinagh in Vista. There do seem to be quite a few different thoughts on layouts on the web, but none seems to stand out as authoritative. 
<P>Though generally speaking, we wouldn't have a script-based keyboard. But it might make more sense to&nbsp;look into&nbsp;keyboard layouts for languages like Amazigh,&nbsp;Tamazight, or Tamasheq, instead?

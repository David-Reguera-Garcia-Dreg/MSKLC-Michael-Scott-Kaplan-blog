<P>Keep in mind this is the "Wednesday night" show, which starts at 12:37am on Thursday.<BR><BR><EM>(Don't worry, Cathy -- Kevin will pick this up on Tivo, I'm sure!)</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>There are some other shows that have&nbsp;already happening&nbsp;or will be&nbsp;happening like on KCRW or the World Cafe. </P>
<P>And for those&nbsp;who can make her Albany show at The Egg&nbsp;on Thursday night (Dec. 14th), she is appearing with&nbsp;the very talented <A class="" href="http://www.rachelyamagata.com/" mce_href="http://www.rachelyamagata.com/">Rachel Yamagata</A>.</P>

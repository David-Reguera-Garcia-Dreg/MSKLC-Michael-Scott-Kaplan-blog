(Excluding of course an Ordinal comparison, which doesn't help me because the ordinal order for Greek extended characters is not the alphabetical order). This is true for all the types of string comparisons in .NET, and someone has said that there is the same problem with the API call CompareString() <BR><BR>Is this an error in Windows, or is there a way to correctly compare and sort Greek characters with accents?

<P>Well, somewhere between the title of this post and the one it alludes to (<STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/01/18/355210.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/01/18/355210.html">this one</A></STRONG>), the answer lies.</P>
<P>These characters have no weight in collation, in either Windows or the .NET Framework, until Vista.</P>
<P>Though as a bonus in managed code, if you are running on Vista, any of the 72&nbsp;Windows-only cultures that are synthesized from new locales in Vista will also give those characters weight....</P>
<P>Short of that, it's ordinal or bust.</P>
<P>As a postscript, this does not change in Orcas, given the whole red bits/green bits mess I have ranted about <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/09/06/742073.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/09/06/742073.html">before</A></STRONG>. The powers that be are convinced that all customers prefer results that are consistent with prior versions even if that means being consistently dead wrong (if you disagree then I won't disagree with you!).</P>

<p>It's so confusing!!</p>
<p>And if Windows can update its collation tables, why can't the .NET framework? I would have expected that they'd use the same data, actually...</p>
<p>Ah well, not that there's much you or I could do about it, unfortunately!</p>

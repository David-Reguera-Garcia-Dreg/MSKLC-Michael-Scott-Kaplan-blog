<P>Ok, in the time since I posted <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/12/15/1299969.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/12/15/1299969.html">Technical Lead's Personal Log: Stardate unknown</A></STRONG>, I have learned a few things:</P>
<UL>
<LI>When my power was back on for a few seconds on Friday night, some parts of the Cambrian were back on completely;</LI>
<LI>A tree fell on a building and it apparently took some power lines with it, affecting a nice chunk of the Cambrian;</LI>
<LI>A tree that falls may indeed make&nbsp;a sound, but it is hard to see where it fell when the power is out;</LI>
<LI>PSE&nbsp;probably won't fix&nbsp;things until this upcoming week some time since it is a "local" issue;</LI>
<LI>I probably have some of the above details wrong, except probably&nbsp;(unfortunately) for the date they will fix it;</LI>
<LI>At least one person called my mobile asking me what I was doing on Tuesday, apparently unaware that anything had actually gone wrong over the weekend;</LI>
<LI>Blogging pays off, at least when it comes to staying alive (I was out of wood and still without power until someone who reads my blog offered me a couch!).</LI></UL>
<P>So I am alive and well, and I have had a shower (those who have to see me tomorrow at work will probably appeciate the latter!).</P>
<P>I'll probably be in a bad mood tomorrow since I was robbed of a weekend and would probably take a day or two off if I had power (until then, going to work actually makes more sense!). But the only meeting I had was cancelled so this might all work out okay....</P>
<P>This will be the last such post for the year, it is time to get back to international stuff! :-)</P>

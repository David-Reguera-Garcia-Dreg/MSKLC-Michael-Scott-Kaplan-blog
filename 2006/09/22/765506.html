<h1>Inaccurate localization can make you bust out laughing</h1>

<P>Remember when I posted (in the beginning of the year) <STRONG><A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/01/17/513418.html">Inaccurate localization can cause problems</A></STRONG>?</P>
<P>Well, we ran across a not quite as dangerous issue just the other day with the&nbsp;Brazilian Portguese&nbsp;localization of Vista (currently in progress, just as with other localizations). The question that came in to <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/kierans/">Kieran</A>: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P>There's a keyboard layout named BR (does not exist) that's showing up in the localized version (PTB). Do you know anything about it?</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/kbdlist_br.png"></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Kieran forwarded it on to me if to ask if I had any thoughts. </P>
<P>I looked at it for a moment, confused. Then suddenly I realized what it was and had to laugh out loud. </P>
<P>Did you spot it to? If you need a hint then you can&nbsp;see what it looks like on an English system:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/kbdlist_us.png"></P>
<P>The localizer had accidentally translated US to BR! :-)</P>
<P>I talked to Kieran afterward and mentioned how much this seemed like a blog post waiting to happen, and she said that she was about to say the same thing. It is one of those great stories like the one in the <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/02/01/364707.html#365158">comments</A> of <STRONG><A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/02/01/364707.html">this post</A></STRONG> that are just funny to people involved in international....</P>
<P>Anyway, like I said, this is not as dangerous as the Welsh street sign, and obviously it will be fixed in the shipping version. But I have found that if you take the stuff that I laugh about that at least 40% of it will make my readers laugh, too. And I am betting that this one falls in that 40%....</P>

<P>Have you ever noticed how the bigger fan someone seems to be of your blog, the more likely they are to ask a question about something that is actually already covered in some prior blog post? :-)</P>
<P>Like that question Charles Bocock asked the other day that I covered the other day in <STRONG><A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/09/12/750155.html">They speak English in other places, too</A></STRONG>. </P>
<P>Like the other day when&nbsp;Feroze asked me: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"><FONT face="times new roman" size=2>
<P>...I have been reading your excellent blog on glob/loc issues and use it as a resource to clarify any questions that I have.<BR><BR>In our product, we need to generate... a map of users in the corporate directory. This map is used to lookup users by punching their lastnames on the telephone keypad. For eg, to lookup GATES, a caller would punch in 42837 on the telephone keypad.<BR><BR>The issue that we are facing is that there are some names which have letters with Accents/Circumflex/Diaresis etc. For such letters we want to use the equivalent character from the ASCII charset. For eg, for Latin letter A with Acute, we want to use ‘A’.<BR><BR>Is there a simple framework API that will do this transformation for us, or do we have to write a mapping table for all Unicode codepoints?<BR><BR>Thanks for your valuable time,</P></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Charles Bocock then actually asked another question in the Suggestion Box that was hauntingly similar:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"><FONT face="times new roman" size=2>
<P>Thanks for your excellent reply to my last question about an English version of Windows ;) <BR><BR>OK, here is something else I could never find a solution for. I used to work with SMS (text messages) a lot, and I tried to find a solution to get the base character from a combination (character with diacritic). <BR><BR>The reason for this is because text messages are costly, can only contain 160 characters, and the character set is missing a bunch of useful diacritic combinations (no circumflex for example). <BR><BR>GSM Character Set: <BR><A href="http://www.csoft.co.uk/sms/character_sets/gsm.htm" target=_new rel=nofollow><FONT color=#0000cc>http://www.csoft.co.uk/sms/character_sets/gsm.htm</FONT></A> <BR><BR>You can send messages in Unicode, but then you're down to only 80 characters per message. <BR><BR>An option we wanted was to strip diacritics from some characters (e.g. ê -&gt; e). <BR><BR>Is there a way of doing this in .NET?</P></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Of course both Feroze and Charles&nbsp;may have just been imitating&nbsp;Dean Harding, who did the very same thing and inspired <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/08/01/446486.html"><STRONG>Stripping out diacritics, redux</STRONG></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;in August of last year.</P>
<P>Dean's was even funnier since he mentioned how he had been reading my blog for years (it was not really that old at the time!). I think everyone was just trying to be polite.</P>
<P>And all three of them are basically answered by <STRONG><A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/02/19/376617.html">Stripping Diactrics</A></STRONG> from February of last year, which points out that normalizing to form D and then removing anything with a combining character class will do a great deal of what they want here.</P>
<P>Bob only knows I never read this blog, and I never search in it unless I am looking for a post I know is there. So I can see where folks are coming from in terms of not knowing about the post with the answer.</P>
<P>But then on the other hand I never claimed I liked myself, either. :-)</P>

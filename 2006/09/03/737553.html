<h1>Is Vista Leaving on a Jet Plane [1]?</h1>

<P>During one of the breaks at the last Unicode Technical Committee meeting, Deborah Anderson wanted to ask me a few questions about Vista and Office 2007. </P>
<P>Now Deborah is one of those cool linguists that I enjoy having conversations with when I have the chance, and she is also the Project Leader of the <A href="http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/sei/">Script Encoding Initiative</A>. She is also one of nicest people in the world, so of course I encouraged her to ask her questions. :-) </P>
<P>What she wanted to know (for both herself and some of her colleagues at the <A href="http://www.linguistics.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley Linguistics Department</A>:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Will the core fonts support Plane 1 characters in Unicode?</LI>
<LI>If not, will future releases?</LI>
<LI>Will MS properly support Plane 1 for those producing their own fonts, giving access in Insert&nbsp;Symbol and other places?</LI></UL>
<P>This is of course the point where I wish that Deborah was not as nice of a person as she is; were she some evil mean rude&nbsp;person then I wouldn't feel bad giving her bad news for some of these questions....</P>
<P>To take the questions slightly out of order:</P>
<P>Windows Character Map will not support anything off of the Basic Multilingual Plane, in either current versions of Windows or in Vista; there is also no update to the character ranges in charmap, a topic about which&nbsp;I have several amusing&nbsp;stories that I will tell another day. :-)</P>
<P>The Word Insert Symbol dialog, limited in current versions to the BMP, will support Plane 1 and Plane 2 in the Office 2007 version. So you can look at Cambria Math:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/cambriamath.png"></P>
<P>(note that it does not have character names or subsets for any of these characters -- this looks like a very minimalist version of support to me!)</P>
<P>Now like I said, Microsoft is not shipping any other Plane 1 fonts, though it is shipping several Plane 2 fonts, such as MingLiU-ExtB, MingLiU_HKSCS-ExtB, and SimSun-ExtB. And although charmap won't show any of the characters in these fonts or any Plane 1 fonts you happen to install, Word's Insert Symbol dialog will do just fine, for either Plane 1:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/code2001.png"></P>
<P>or Plane 2:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/code2002.png"></P>
<P>(notice how I am using Code2001 and Code2002 from <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code2000">James Kass</A> for the above samples to show that the tools will work with fonts other than the ones Microsoft ships).</P>
<P>Now Code2001 happens to include support for Old Persian Cuneiform, Tengwar, and Cirth, in the Plane 0 and Plane 15 Private Use Areas, and this gives us the chance to see that the Insert Symbol dialog does not support other supplemental planes:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/plane1plane2.png"></P>
<P>There is obviously room for some additional improvment here in the future -- like character names for supplementary characters, additional block names, additional planes. But it looks like the immediate needs involving Plane 1 should all be handled adequately for the time being. :-)</P>

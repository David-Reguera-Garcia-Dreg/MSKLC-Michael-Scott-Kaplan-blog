<P>I figure that since I initially posted about TUNE in <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/08/31/733302.html"><STRONG>And if your language starts playing a different TUNE</STRONG></A> that actually mentioned a meeting that would be happening in Tamil Nadu over the weekend that I should post some follow-up information on what happened....</P>
<P><A href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tamil-ulagam/message/35427">This Yahoo group has a thread or two</A> with lots of summary info, excerpted below.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>
<P>Due to a last minute attempt to reach out the tamil community on the proposed unciode encoding a ONE day conference was organised by the&nbsp;Tamil Virtual University.<BR><BR>Here a summary<BR>1. The name TUNE has been changed to TANE - TAmil New Encoding.<BR>2. To make revision on the proposed code chart of TANE- Symbols and numerals<BR>3. To obtain consensus from countries outside Tamil Nadu.<BR>4. To seek support from software developers such as Microsoft and vendors.<BR>5. To chart a migration time table from current encoding to TANE<BR>6. TANE to be made available FREE for the community for easy access&nbsp;in and outside tamil nadu.&nbsp;( the last tools offered free by GOI was hosted by a server from NOIDA and they were cumbersome) - Prof Balakrishnan comment.<BR><BR>There were few members of TU present at the event.&nbsp;Thiru Ramki, Naa Elangovan, Badri, Anbarasan, Logasundaram ( he is&nbsp;not in this list) members of KTS - Anto Peter and Ananth - KTS President and Sec respectively.<BR><BR>Here is an extract of email send by Elangovan of cadgraf to the Infitt.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P>To-days meeting was chaired by Dr.V.C.K and inaugurated by&nbsp;Mr.Dayanidhi Maran, Minister for IT and Communications. The Technical&nbsp;Committee meeting was headed by Dr.M.Anandhakrishnan. It was well&nbsp;attended by Microsoft, IBM, CDAC, IISC, IIT, Anna University, KTS,&nbsp;etc; The minister requested for a unanimous decision of all concerned&nbsp;for the most efficient and most appropriate 16bit encoding for Tamil&nbsp;as early as possible as the E-Governance project of the Indian Govt.&nbsp;may have to be rolled out from the beginning of 2007.&nbsp;There was good technical participation from all sectors. At the end,&nbsp;Dr.M.A. announced that there is a near consensus to proceed with the&nbsp;16 bit encoding for Tamil which need not be the exact replica of&nbsp;TUNE. This will be called 16 bit Tamil encoding. However this will be&nbsp;publicised in all web sites to seek wider consultations world-wide&nbsp;and from all vendors for the next 3 months. The final encoding will&nbsp;be based on the feed backs and suggestions received. The official&nbsp;version of the recommendation will be submitted by Prof.MA to the TN&nbsp;Govt. for their further action<BR><BR>I am happy to see that now there is More time and scope for all&nbsp;technocrats all over the the world to participate and offer their&nbsp;suggestions.<BR><BR>Regards<BR>Elango</P></BLOCKQUOTE></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>So, the name of the new encoding is now TANE rather than TUNE (isn't Tane&nbsp;the Māori god of birds? I may be misremembering something here!).</P>
<P>I heard from several sources there that "Unicode and MichKa were a Western monopoly," which is amusing to me given the fact that Unicode is 100% locked in with ISO 10646 and all - I wonder how the NBs in&nbsp;Japan and other countries would react to being called a Western monopoly. </P>
<P>It was also&nbsp;interesting to be named so directly and prominently in a meeting where a bunch of people don't like me very much. Thankfully several others pointed out the good work that INFITT WG02 has been doing that I have been helping with. </P>
<P>That's the secret --&nbsp;if you are going to make enemies, be sure that you also make friends!</P>
<P>When it came down to an actual vote, only two voted to keep the current encoding; 43 voted to form a new 16-bit encoding. </P>
<P>And there are two interesting strategic points I'll put up without commenting on as I think they speak for themselves (I have heard them both many times before over the last few years):</P>
<OL>
<LI>That Chinese could get 27000 characters when there govt. put there foot down; similarly Japanese got 500+ for a character encoding system. Similarly if GOI and TN Govt. put there pressure we will get this. If they don't give, we will use PUA and over few years it will become defacto standard. 
<LI>There is huge cost savings in E-Governance. TN Govt has to spend Rs.3000 crores for there E-Governance initiative where 1GB is needed for each citizen. Adopting TUNE over Unicode will result in saving of Rs.1500 Crores because of Storage savings alone.</LI></OL>
<P>Well, I suppose we are all living in interesting times. It will be interesting to see what happens next.</P>

The Chinese government has since been forced to implement their alternative syllabic encoding model in the PUA on Planes 0 and 15 (actually it is more complicated than that, as the government specifies two implementation levels -- Level 1 supporting the PUA precomposed syllables only, and Level 2 supporting PUA .precomposed syllables and standard combining Tibetan). I believe that the Tibetan case provides a strong precedent for not accepting the TUNE/TANE re-encoding of Tamil.<br></div>

I think it's a GOOD thing to have your script considered &quot;complex&quot;. Just look at the cool stuff you can do with Segoe Script when English is being considered &quot;complex&quot;!<br><br>I've followed some of the &quot;discussion&quot; on the unicode list, and I gotta agree - they all seem to have their hands on their ears and saying &quot;la la la&quot;</div>
<p><a id="741064" href="#741064">#</a> <strong>Mike Dimmick</strong> on Tuesday, September 05, 2006 9:11 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Unicode is very much structured as a glyph-additive system, so far as I can tell. That is, the glyph produced by &lt;(base character) (combining character)&gt; is very similar graphically to superimposing the combining character glyph(s) on the base character glyph, with some adjustments for spacing. Glyph addition - where each glyph (or a couple of glyphs each side of a consonant for some Indic vowels) adds (or subtracts, in case of virama/pulla! - but this is still an added symbol, not removing part of a glyph) a recognisable sound or modifies the sound in a known way - works for many scripts.<br><br>This model does not work for Far East scripts where the same glyphs are used by multiple languages but pronounced differently, hence why the CJK Hanzi characters are simply listed as 'CJK UNIFIED IDEOGRAPH' in the catalogue - there's no 'sound' or concept that can be listed as there is for other scripts, making the diagrammatic reference chart the sole source for which character is which. The 27,000 characters are not solely for Chinese but for Japanese and Korean as well (possibly other languages that use Hanzi too) and you'll hear plenty of complaints from all three groups that they should never have been unified in this way. You can't use components of each glyph as building blocks to make a more complex glyph because the components don't have any real identity or value of their own.<br><br>The only thing then to explain is why the Latin alphabet is pretty consistently encoded with precomposed characters. The answer basically is history. Western and Far East encodings have an awful lot of history. ISO 646 goes way back (as ANSI X3.4 in 1968), the regional variants (mapping parts of the 7-bit set to precomposed modified base characters) date back to 1972. The ISO 8859 series started life in ECMA - I can't find a date for the first edition, but the second edition of ECMA 94 (which became parts 1 to 4 of ISO 8859) is dated 1986.<br><br>The preamble to ECMA 94 states that the reason for including the precomposed characters was because modified characters were typically encoded as &lt;(base character) (Backspace) (modifier)&gt; which causes really horrible processing problems. Ironically one of the standards listed in the preamble, ISO 6937-2, is considered 'difficult to use for processing as some graphic characters are represented by one and others by two [byte] combinations'. Here, however, the modifier preceded the base character and was therefore a bit odd.<br><br>It does feel a bit weird to be 'restricting' a script to a smaller number of characters when Unicode offers such a large range of code points, but there are simply so many scripts to encode that it pays, when not having to offer compatibility with an older standard, to be conservative with allocations than going overboard with largesse and running out of code points prematurely.<br><br>The idea of using the PUA invokes Raymond's common question, 'what if everyone did this?' If everyone did this, it would be impossible to write documents, or encode fonts, containing two scripts that both used the PUA. The word Private in Private Use Area means that it's for the end-user's private use, governments certainly should not be trying to use this area.</div>

And since it cannot be used and since normalization is defined by Unicode, it is not an answer. <br><br>Actually, most of what you are saying is either incorrect or misleading (mathematical letters have intrinsically different properties than letters and are not letters in any real sense, as an example, and the suggested Myanmar changes are an incredibly controversial issue that involves sequences that CANNOT be encoded properly in the current model which does apply to Tamil or any of the TUNE/TANE arguments).<br><br>And because of this, the whole comment is misleading and confusing in the context of TUNE/TANE. I'd rather avoid misleading people if possible, which is why keeping us on the actual topic here would make more sense than bringing up less than relevant examples of exceptional cases that do not establish precedents for Tamil to use. <br><br>Now as to processing speed, I also disagree with you.<br><br>English processing for many operations could be make significantly faster if we re-ordered the letters used in English to intersperse the uppercase and lowercase letters. That is NOT an argument to re-order ASCII that anyone in their right minds would accept. And it does not apply to Tamil either, even if proof did exist. It is an attempt to use an out of scope problem as an argument for an improper change. <br><br>The same implies to the need to capture the dozens of phonemes that exist in English by encoding characters rather than relying on the five that exist in the alphabet. Encoding such characters would make spellcheckers, thesauri, and such MUCH more efficient. Does this mean that we need to encode all those new characters, due to Unicode's vicious refusal to allow efficient processing in these tools? No, it does not -- for the same reason as the Tamil change is out of scope. <br><br>The fact that the Tamil arguments are all unproven (and that the original flawed proofs were withdrawn) is just a bonus in showing the underlying actions of those proposing the change; the fact is that the entire attempt is out of order.</div>

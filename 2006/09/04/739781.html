<h1>Kristin takes first prize at the Song Writing Contest</h1>

<P>I am basically a lazy person. </P>
<P>This is the main reason that I decided not to schlep down to Gig Harbor for the <A href="http://www.gigharborfolkfestival.com/">Gig Harbor Folk Festival</A>, even though I knew <A href="http://kristinconnell.com/">Kristin Connell</A> would be playing and I wasn't doing anything that I couldn't get out of. </P>
<P>I am basically an idiot though. Because Kristin won first prize in the <A href="http://www.gigharborfolkfestival.com/song_writing.htm">Song Writing Competition</A> and is now working on breaking in the new Tacoma ER28C guitar she won, plus she has a half day of studio time, to boot. And I missed it.</P>
<P>The festival actually looked like it would have been as lot of fun to go see, so next year I am going to not be so lazy and just go. It probably won't cure me of the idiocy problem, but it may be a positive step in that direction....</P>

<P>Raymond, in responding to Steve Makofsky's <A href="http://www.furrygoat.com/2006/08/a_question_thats_bothering_me.html">How do you throw out a garbage can?</A>, asks <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/08/30/731753.aspx">How do you wash soap?</A></P>
<P>Now I remember an old Friends episode where this came up (The One Where Joey Moves Out), right at the beginning of the episode:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>
<P><STRONG>CHANDLER</STRONG>: Waaa-aaah. <BR><BR><STRONG>JOEY</STRONG>: What? <BR><BR><STRONG>CHANDLER</STRONG>: The spoon. You licked and-and you put. You licked and you put.<BR><BR><STRONG>JOEY</STRONG>: Yeah, so?<BR><BR><STRONG>CHANDLER</STRONG>: Well don't you see how gross that is? I mean that's like you using my toothbrush. You used my toothbrush?<BR><BR><STRONG>JOEY</STRONG>: Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain.<BR><BR><STRONG>CHANDLER</STRONG>: Mine is the red one! Oh God. Can open, worms everywhere.<BR><BR><STRONG>JOEY</STRONG>: Hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap?<BR><BR><STRONG>CHANDLER</STRONG>: Because soap is soap. It's self-cleaning. <BR><BR><STRONG>JOEY</STRONG>: Alright, well next time you take a shower, think about the last thing I wash and the first thing you wash.</P></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This little conversation is the explanation for my answer. I&nbsp;am always sure to&nbsp;rinse it off. Because I don't really tend to connect the last thing I washed yesterday with the first thing I wash today. Soap is self-cleaning, but you do have to actually <STRONG>clean</STRONG> it. :-)</P>

<p><strong>Igor</strong> on 28 Sep 2006 10:23 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Why do you people bother with soap bars when liquid soap is so much more convenient?<br><br>- You can't get it to be dirty<br>- It washes better<br>- It is refilable<br>- You can't drop it<br><br>The last thing can be very convenient in some circumstances where you would be in danger if you needed to bend to pick it up ;-)</div>

<P>Earlier this year, I remember <STRONG><A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/04/08/571353.html">saying</A></STRONG> </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P>It is amazing how the number of times you need to bite your freaking tongue around parents is directly proportional to how many things you learn about language acquisition!</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>And it is true -- because parents will often say the most inane or insane things abut their kids and their language skills. :-)</P>
<P>But I did like the study at the University of Washington about how <A href="http://www.washington.edu/newsroom/news/2003archive/02-03archive/k021703.html">Brief exposure to Mandarin can help American infants learn Chinese</A>. The most interesting point of which is that (if true) it means that brief REAL exposure to a greater number of phonemes during that critical stage before all of the youngster's language instincts have faded could make later language acquisition easier. </P>
<P>The fun trick now might be to figure the smallest number of languages that would allow for the largest number of phonemes to be learned by a child -- and then to arrange for a series of nannies or whatnot who&nbsp;know those languages to come and speak them?</P>
<P>I wonder if the big language/phoneme chart exists somewhere to try to make such an acquisition plan.... :-)</P>
<P>Not to ding Dora the Explorer (or Sesame Street's efforts to compete with her!), but that sort of plan would&nbsp;be of&nbsp;more real in terms of benefit to a child if a parent wanted to make an effort!</P>

<p><strong>Jeremy Bettis</strong> on 10 Sep 2006 9:35 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">This is also a great argument for speaking many words to your babies, and reading them stories.<br><br>I remember people teasing us because we didn't talk to our children in baby-talk, but spoke to them with a full vocabulary even though they didn't understand it.</div>
<p><strong>Jim Jimjim</strong> on 11 Sep 2006 5:18 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">I wonder about the trade-offs though. &nbsp;Just as multilingual children have smaller per-language vocabularies, maybe it's the case that children exposed to Mandarin have more trouble later on discriminating spoken English that is faint, noisy, or just accented.<br><br>Perhaps we prevent their feature detectors from overfitting the English phoneme training data, but we shouldn't forget that the dectector calibration is there for a reason.<br></div>
<p><strong>Zach</strong> on 13 Sep 2006 10:57 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Dora can be insideious. Rachel (my daughter for those of you other than Michael) had been for weeks saying what sounded to us like &quot;A Gentelman! A Gentelman!&quot; and we had no idea what she was saying. &nbsp;It turned out she was saying &quot;Aiuda mei!&quot; which means &quot;help me&quot; in spanish. <br><br>Hopefully her exposure to spanish (via dora) and other languages through various other people/media will give her much better language skills than her parents.</div>

<p><strong>Zach</strong> on 14 Sep 2006 11:23 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Is she really hot? Because i'm on board for that one. :-)<br><br></div>
<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 14 Sep 2006 11:43 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Well I'd assume the hiring decision would be a joint one that you would have to justify to your S.O., so I'll let you judge the likelihood of <STRONG>that</STRONG>. :-)</div>

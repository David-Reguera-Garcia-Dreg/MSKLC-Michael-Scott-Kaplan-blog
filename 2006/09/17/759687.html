<P>I talked before about how <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/09/17/758310.html"><STRONG>Tamil is an abugida</STRONG></A>. I thought I'd talk for a bit about input methods, since once you know what the language is and now that I have suggested that what the language is should have a bigger role in how it is typed than how the language is encoded.</P>
<P>I'll start this post by proving how bad not doing as I suggest can be; I'll point out the current Tamil keyboard on Windows, the one that has been there since Windows 2000, in the base, shift, altgr, and ctrl+shift states:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/kbdintam_base.png"></P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/kbdintam_shift.png"></P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/kbdintam_altgr.png"></P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/kbdintam_ctrl.png"></P>
<P>If you are a native speaker, this might seem unfamiliar. And definitely not QWERTY phonetic. Like if you look at the <STRONG>N</STRONG> key (VK_N) you find ல, <A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0bb2">U+0bb2</A>, TAMIL LETTER LA:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/kbdintam_vk_n.png"></P>
<P>and if you look at the <STRONG>V</STRONG> key (VK_V), you'll find ந, <A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0ba8">U+0ba8</A>, TAMIL LETTER NA:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/kbdintam_vk_v.png"></P>
<P>Not really a keyboard that builds an intuitive user experience, is it?</P>
<P>Now sure, you could try and build a more intuitive keyboard with <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/tools/msklc.mspx">MSKLC</A>, but there is s lot working against you there -- such as the fact that there isn't really a dynamic way to affect the text when you type multiple keystrokes.</P>
<P>And besides, if you really want that kind of keyboard you can build it right now with <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/tools/msklc.mspx">MSKLC</A>, and without me. :-)</P>
<P>But how about if I try to build something using the same stuff I used for the <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/07/20/671835.html"><STRONG>Unicode</STRONG></A> and <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/07/27/679538.html"><STRONG>Cantonese</STRONG></A> IMEs.</P>
<P>This one is not yet ready for prime time (neither is the Sinhala one I am working on with the help of Thakara I mentioned <STRONG><A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/08/18/706063.html">before</A></STRONG>), but I can show what I have in mind so people can poke holes in the idea (or if they like it they can say that, too!).</P>
<P>Here it is before anything is typed:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/tim0.png"></P>
<P>Let's try typing the letter <STRONG>N</STRONG>, you know, that <STRONG>VK_N</STRONG> we were talking about before.</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/tim1.png"></P>
<P>Interesting... a nice list of candidates, as well as a bit of input that suggests how additional letters can narrow the field. Plusd, you notice how that first item has no letters after the character? That's what I will get if I hit ENTER&nbsp;(or 1, or choose the first item)&nbsp;right then:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/tim2.png"></P>
<P>What do you know <STRONG>ந்</STRONG> (a.k.a. <A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0ba8">U+0ba8</A> <A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0bcd">U+0bcd</A>) -- TAMIL LETTER NA plus&nbsp;TAMIL SIGN VIRAMA, or more conventionally, NA + puLLi. Which is basically a letter N, since the inherent vowel is being dropped.</P>
<P>Ok, let's try a bit more. Let's try typing <STRONG>N</STRONG> followed by <STRONG>I</STRONG>. What happens then?</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/tim3.png"></P>
<P>Well, that thins the field out a bit, huh? I can just hit ENTER (or 1, or choose the first item) and be like the Tamil version of the knights who say நி (NI):</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/tim4.png"></P>
<P>. Or I can type <STRONG>NII</STRONG> (or 2,&nbsp;or choose the second item earlier, and since there is only one item it will just commit it automatically:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/tim5.png"></P>
<P>Now the fact that the input method gives that candidate list and those hints as to what typing will do to change the list can be very helpful in learning the layout. The data behind the entries with TAMIL LETTER NA is simple enough:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face="Consolas,Courier New" size=4><STRONG>"n"&nbsp;&nbsp; = "</STRONG>ந்<STRONG>"<BR>"na"&nbsp; = "</STRONG>ந<STRONG>"<BR>"naa" = "</STRONG>நா<STRONG>"<BR>"ni"&nbsp; = "</STRONG>நி<STRONG>"<BR>"nii" = "</STRONG>நீ<STRONG>"<BR>"nu"&nbsp; = "</STRONG>நு<STRONG>"<BR>"nuu" = "</STRONG>நூ<STRONG>"<BR>"ne"&nbsp; = "</STRONG>நெ<STRONG>"<BR>"nee" = "</STRONG>நே<STRONG>"<BR>"nai" = "</STRONG>நை<STRONG>"<BR>"no"&nbsp; = "</STRONG>நொ<STRONG>"<BR>"noo" = "</STRONG>நோ<STRONG>"<BR>"nau" = "</STRONG>நௌ<STRONG>"</STRONG></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and the input method just kind of extends that to all of the consonants in the language (and adds a few of those Grantha that are in Unicode now). </P>
<P>Of course this is working entirely off of using the Unicode names for all the letters in the Tamil block as pure transliterations and building an input method from them as is (with some minor additions based on what people have told me in the past), which will not be 100% of what a native speaker might expect. Here is what I am working off of right now</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face="Latha,Consolas,Courier New" size=4>a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; அ<BR>aa&nbsp;&nbsp; ஆ<BR>i&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; இ<BR>ii&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ஈ<BR>u&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; உ<BR>uu&nbsp;&nbsp; ஊ<BR>e&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; எ<BR>ee&nbsp;&nbsp; ஏ<BR>ai&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ஐ<BR>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ஒ<BR>oo&nbsp;&nbsp; ஓ<BR>au&nbsp;&nbsp; ஔ<BR>k&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; க்<BR>ng&nbsp;&nbsp; ங்<BR>c&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ச்<BR>j&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ஜ்<BR>ny&nbsp;&nbsp; ஞ்<BR>tt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ட்<BR>nn&nbsp;&nbsp; ண்<BR>t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; த்<BR>n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ந்<BR>nnn&nbsp; ன்<BR>p&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ப்<BR>f&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ஃப்<BR>m&nbsp;&nbsp; ம்<BR>y&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ய்<BR>r&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ர்<BR>rr&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ற்<BR>l&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ல்<BR>ll&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ள்<BR>lll&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ழ்<BR>v&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; வ்<BR>ss&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ஷ்<BR>s&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ஸ்<BR>sh&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ஶ்<BR>h&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ஹ்</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Feel free to suggest anything that might be wrong here (is you do not see the second last entry SHA + puLLi then you might not be running on Vista!).</P>
<P>Now this kind of a phonetic input system seems more intuitive, both it what initially gets typed and in the feedback you get&nbsp;while you are typing. It certainly feels (to me) like a much more natural system than typing <STRONG>I I N</STRONG> to get <STRONG>NII</STRONG>. </P>
<P>Though I am not a native speaker so my opinion is not the most important type of opinion here, of course. :-)</P>
<P>Which is not to say a visual input system would be impossible -- one could simply swap around the letters and create one based on the visual aspects, too. I am not sure whether or not that would be useful, so I'll again ask native Tamil speakers what they think....</P>
<P>And I'll try to make this sample and the Sinhala one available soon! :-)</P>

Is that a typo?<br><br>And secondly how do i get the &quot;aauta ellluthu&quot; (the symbol that is comes before the p in the sound f, the 3 dots on a triangle character). Though it is not used in regular discourse, it has its uses in peotic tamil.<br><br>Also, I find this phonetic typing a bit tedious. (maybe thats just me.. and I am a bit inclined towards a completely visual representation).<br><br><br></div>

I was mainly focusing on the consonants and vowels for this post, that's all.<br><br>Of course where to put it is an interesting issue to decide. Any thoughts? :-)</div>

From&nbsp;the standpoint of the visual layout it would also be more jarring since it would move from the standalone vowels to the dependent vowel before the consonant as you typed, which seems even more fatiguing, to me....</div>
<p><a id="759876" href="#759876">#</a> <strong>Michael S.

Obviously such an effort will have differences from the MS Phonetic Input Tool due to the different approaches and of course different sources and different levels of expertise....</div>
<p><a id="760292" href="#760292">#</a> <strong>vishnu vyas</strong> on 18 Sep 2006 2:19 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Hmm.. about the unicode.. I find it weird that the lighter na has more 'n's than the heavier (harder) na. Logically it should be the other way round isn't it?<br><br>And secondly why not use capital/small english alphabets to represent soft vs hard sounds? like l for la and L for lla?<br><br>And about phonetic input being tedius.. I should have probably used the word - unnatural. I will explain what I am saying.<br>For example consider the tamil word for house - veedu.<br><br>In a phonetic input system I would have to type &quot;v-i-i-t-t-u&quot; (according to what you have specified) even though veedu is more natural. On the other hand if it was based purely on visual representation.. I would have typed v-the sign for ii-t-the sign for u.<br><br>Strictly speaking there are only 43 distinct symbols in tamil (including consonants, vowels, the vowel marks and the pulli). So if we can use shift in a consistent manner (harder/longer sounds) we can easily make it within the normal keyboard. Infact, we can take into acount the simple rule in tamil that explicit vowel letters are only used in the beginning we can simplfy it further more..<br><br>(when i say the sign I just mean the markings and not the vowels themselves). Infact you can conserve space on the keyboard by using shift to represent smaller/longer (for vowels) or harder/softer sounds &nbsp;(for consonants) on the same key. that would make it 7 + <br><br>Also, tamil has certain rules that are almost never violated and can improve the intellisense thing.. <br><br>1. The na corresponding to a single n occurs exclusively at the begining of words or when it occurs in the middle, it is allways the pure consonant form (n+pulli, pronounced as indh).<br><br>2. The other two na's never occur at the beginning of words at all.<br>(there are rules like these for other characters too..these are the ones that I remember).<br><br>The other things I can suggest to the phonetic input you have give is<br><br>1. accept both d/t for tt. (ta).<br>2. use th instead of t (its tha, not ta).</div>

But they do not have to be used for the keyboard, they were just a starting point for me. <br><br>But I cannot use small/capital letters as the input method itself does not distinguish between them....<br><br>Also, it does not have knowledge of word boundries -- it is a simple table based system.<br><br>But I will incorporate the other feedback you have here. :-)</div>

I was thinking about a 'real' Tamil keyboard with actual Tamil characters on the keys. In *that* case my argument still stands, I think. (And it looks like it actually works that way too.)<br><br>Also, about the Tamil characters not lining up with QUERTY; have you ever heard of AZERTY or Dvorak? ;-) These layouts don't line up with QUERTY either.

<h1>What's the latest on the MS front?</h1>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2><EM>(Nothing technical, you know the drill)</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I realize that I have probably been a little remiss in posting about what is going on lately, and there are at least a few people I know who probably only read this blog because of that (not everyone is into the internationalization thing!).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I just got my latest Echocardiogram and my <A href="http://www.hcoa.org/hcoacme/chf-cme/chf00048.htm">LVEF</A> is still up high. Which is very good.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I was corrected on one point --&nbsp;my previous LVEF values were not up to 75% as I posted <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/01/24/516670.html">previously</A>, but that is probably a good thing as 75% is a bit <EM>too</EM> high, really. But I am in high 60s and have remained there.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><EM>(So if anyone tells me to "have&nbsp;a heart" I can tell them that I am, and that I can prove it. Though once again it is probably why I am not invited to </EM><A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/02/13/531110.html"><EM>some parties</EM></A><EM>.)</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Now someone freaked me out a little when they pointed out that a few folks on Novantrone ended up with secondary acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), which although better than Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML), the thing that the Tysabri trial patients <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/03/01/382200.html">died from</A>, is no picnic.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Which remind me -- it looks like Tysabri on its own has been deemed safe and is back on track for finishing up the trials, albeit at a more careful pace. This is very good news for a lot of people (especially including people who had been on the trial for years).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Now I may have taken myself out of the Tysabri running now that I am taking the Novantrone, though I will have to check with my neurologist to find out what she thinks. But even if it is true, I am not enough of a jerk to refuse to be happy for the people who can take it....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Anyway, I'll probably talk to my neurologist about the whole AML thing, just in case.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I was thinking the other day (as I crossed the street in my scooter) that the odds of one of those absent-minded drivers accidentally hitting me is like at least 10,000 to 1. Which suddenly made me uncomfortable thinking about how many streets I have been crossing -- how long before the odds catch up?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I got over it quickly, but I think I am going to be more careful from now on, just in case. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So there is not much else going on -- symptoms seem pretty stable otherwise, and nothing seems to be getting worse. Which is always good news.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Even after all this time, I still have trouble with that aspect of medicine where a&nbsp;test that is positive, or a disease that is progressing, is a bad thing. But nothing is progressing, which is a good thing, and I like that.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Anyway, the reason I don't post about&nbsp;the MS thing as often is that things are going well. So try to understand if it is a while before the next time....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I'll post soon about music I have seen lately, including seeing Duncan Sheik last weekend in a very cool show. And I&nbsp;should be posting a bit about&nbsp;a font thing&nbsp;later today....</FONT></P>

<h1>Maybe there is such a thing as a surrogateS character (dammit!)</h1>

<p><font face=Tahoma><em>(No, the title of this post does not contain a typo!)</em></font></p>
<p><font face=Tahoma>I have a regular reader of this blog who is a 12 year old young man named Dean.</font></p>
<p><font face=Tahoma>He has an interesting take on my post <strong><a HREF="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/07/27/444101.html">There is no such thing as a surrogate character (dammit!)</a></strong>.</font></p>
<p><font face=Tahoma>Although he did not really follow all of the Unicode take on the evilness of the term "surrogate character," he pointed out that the real problem was not that "there is no such thing as a surrogate character" at all.</font></p>
<p><font face=Tahoma>He suggested that we should allow people to call these characters that are made up of two surrogate code units by a simple term:</font></p>
<p><font face=Tahoma size=6>A SURROGATES CHARACTER</font></p>
<p><font face=Tahoma>(the emphasis is mine)</font></p>
<p><font face=Tahoma>When he first suggested it, I went back through previous mails from Dean that convinced me his age claim was genuine (up to and including his delight that I used the word <em>dammit</em> in a post title!).</font></p>
<p><font face=Tahoma>It struck me as a much more brilliant compromise that more accurately resolves the problem of the natural tendency people seem to have to call these entities "surrogate characters" by shifting the battlefield&nbsp;in such a way&nbsp;that the language mavens, the grammar police, and the wordinistas can start battling for us!</font></p>
<p><font face=Tahoma>And to be honest, Dean suggested that some of these mavens could perhaps help the cause, citing <a HREF="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/05/08/415549.html">this post</a> and several <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/">Language Log</a> posts on the language maven issue.</font></p>
<p><font face=Tahoma>Why not have these busybodies do some work for us, just for a change? :-)</font></p>
<p><font face=Tahoma>Clearly there are two surrogate code units there, so calling the two of them a surrogate character is an obvious pluralization mismatch.</font></p>
<p><font face=Tahoma>What do you think?</font></p>
<p><font face=Tahoma><em>In my opinion, a touchdown (with the extra point), a field goal, and a safety for Dean, 12 points that the Seahawks could have used to win the Super Bowl yesterday! :-(</em></font></p>

So, for example, the two UTF-8 code units required to represent a character like 'ƒà', U+0108, (random example) are not actually called surrogates, even though the principle is the same.<br /><br />In which case, there is no real ambiguity to the term 'surrogates character' because it could only possibly be referring to the UTF-16 representation of a character...<br /><br />Hehe, pedantry is fun... :o)</div>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Earlier today, in reponse to my post <A HREF="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/02/28/540452.html">[Localized] Date/Time format tokens</A>, regular reader Serge Wautier commented:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><EM><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>Oddly enough, according to your screenshots, the Turkish translation seems to use the same letter (s) for hours and seconds! </FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Let's take a closer look:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/time041f.jpg"></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Geez, he's right.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It gets worse if you look at all of the choices one has for date formats:</FONT></P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/EnglishInTurkish.jpg"></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Why that is downright confusable, isn't it?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Hmmm... makes me wonder what happens if we look at the Turkish locale in Turkish (the above is looking at English (US) in Turkish):</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/TurkishInTurkish.jpg"></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Ok, that is a bit less confusable, isn't it? :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It also explains why a localizer may not notice the difference&nbsp;when they are&nbsp;reviewing what their change looks like -- how likely would they be to check other locales? And the wide range of them?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>This kind of problem is a side effect of the wide range of possibilities that is hard to completely test. For another example, here is the Arabic user locale list -- note the appropriate use of parentheses:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/EnglishInArabicUserLocale.jpg"></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Ok, now let's move over to the UI language list:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/EnglishInArabic.jpg"></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>How do you say <STRONG>Oops!</STRONG> in Arabic again? :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Now the original issue with Turkish can certainly complicate string parsing, and if you try to change the order of the time parameters you will likely run into problems (luckily this is very seldom done!).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Perhaps it is a good thing that this is only a UI feature and not a programmatic one?</FONT></P>

Are there a large number of Portuguese users with a strong dislike for uppercase letters? ;)</div>
<p><a id="540685" href="#540685">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 28 Feb 2006 12:57 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Ah yes, I will be talking a bit about that issue soon (and a few others to do with Portuguese)....</div>
<p><a id="540700" href="#540700">#</a> <strong>Richard Gadsden</strong> on 28 Feb 2006 1:19 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">I guess the difference between Portugu&#234;s and portugu&#234;s is that one is Brazilian and the other is Iberian.</div>
<p><a id="540701" href="#540701">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 28 Feb 2006 1:27 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Indeed, Richard. The tip of the iceberg, trust me!</div>
<p><a id="540770" href="#540770">#</a> <strong>Michael Dunn_</strong> on 28 Feb 2006 2:54 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Speaking of Portugu&#234;s, I hope you can discuss how/why there are Brazil and Portugal localizations, when MS's general policy is not to localize like that (ie, there's no UK English). &nbsp;I know a little about the differences (such as Brazil using &quot;f&quot; where Portugal uses &quot;ph&quot;); maybe they are different enough that Brazilians would have a hard time reading Portugal Portuguese?</div>
<p><a id="540860" href="#540860">#</a> <strong>Dean Harding</strong> on 28 Feb 2006 5:21 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Wow, I didn't know Arabic locales also mirrored the &quot;shading&quot; of controls so that the &quot;light&quot; part is in the top-right and the &quot;shadow&quot; part is in the bottom-left!<br><br>I guess is makes sense because in the same way that left-to-right people scan a page top-left to bottom-right, right-to-left people would scan a page top-right to bottom-left, and it would be jarring if the shading didn't follow the same pattern...</div>
<p><a id="545857" href="#545857">#</a> <strong>Roozbeh Pournader</strong> on 7 Mar 2006 9:35 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Well, to get to the linguistic side, it's interesting that the problem with Turkish is somehow related to the Arabic language (also used in the post). Saat and Saniye both have Arabic roots (ساعت and ثانیه), but while they start with different letters in the original Arabic (prounced [s] and [θ] respecticely), the prounciation of those two letters got unified in Persian and then Ottomen, from where the word came to modern Turkish. When Turkish started using the phonetic Latin alphabet, these became one letter.</div>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I pointed out in the post </FONT><FONT face=Tahoma><A HREF="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/11/18/492339.html"><STRONG>Some sort of order to collation</STRONG></A> that </FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>it is easy to dismiss linguistic issues when one is thinking about collation. As Steven </FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>Pinker pointed out in <EM>The Language Instinct</EM>:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><EM>...for the same reason that alphbetical order is similar across the Hebrew, Greek, Roman, and Cyrillic alphabets. There is nothing special about alphabetical order; it was just the order that the Caananites invented, and all Western alphbets came from theirs.</EM></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But it is not as simple as that. Looking at the&nbsp;beginnings of the&nbsp;alphabets for Hebrew:</FONT><FONT face=Tahoma></P></FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>
<UL>
<LI>א 
<LI>ב 
<LI>ג 
<LI>ד 
<LI>ה 
<LI>ו 
<LI>ז</LI></UL></FONT>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>vs. Greek:</FONT></P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Αα</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Ββ</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Γγ</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Δδ</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Εε</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Ζζ</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Ηη</FONT></LI></UL>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>vs. Russian:</FONT></P><FONT face=Tahoma>
<UL>
<LI>Аа 
<LI>Бб 
<LI>Вв 
<LI>Гг 
<LI>Дд 
<LI>Ее 
<LI>Ёё</LI></UL></FONT>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>vs. English:</FONT></P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Aa</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Bb</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Cc</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Dd</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Ee</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Ff</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Gg</FONT></LI></UL>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>and so on, we are as struck by the similarities (e.g. in Hebrew there is actually both a <STRONG>בּ</STRONG> (bet) and a <STRONG>ב</STRONG> (vet) that show up after the Alef, just as there is both a <STRONG>Бб</STRONG> (be) and a <STRONG>Вв</STRONG> (ve) after the А in Russian) as by the differences (e.g. there are two 'v' sounds in Hebrew, neither of which are anywhere near the 'v' in English -- or that in Hebrew <STRONG>א</STRONG> (alef) is silent while in most other languages it is not).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Obviously there is a commonality here that is not accidental, but just as obviously the actual letters present and the order of those letters has changed over time in different languages.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>There are many possible reasons for change here, and looking at the differences from the original order from the Caananites gave us and any language today, many of the reasons for changes in order have either an orthographic or a phonemic basis.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Which brings us to something of a linguistic basis, doesn't it? :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Now this is especially true as we look at languages that pick up the use of a script such as Latin, Cyrillic, or Arabic and find the need to add letters. Because obviously they need a place to put those additional letters within their alphabetic order, and there are obvious reasons to choose a linguistic basis for that ordering.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Now this ordering may conflict with what a user of the script but not of the language may have for a letter -- thus <STRONG>ڇ</STRONG> (tcheheh) will seem to&nbsp;many Arabic language readers&nbsp;like a <STRONG>ح</STRONG> (hah) with four funny dots in it, similar to how I (as a speaker of English) might look at <STRONG>ṻ</STRONG> (u with macron and diaresis) as a&nbsp;<STRONG>u</STRONG> with some&nbsp; funny smudges on top of it.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Am I wrong? Certainly.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Is that Arabic reader? Yes.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But in the context of both the English and Arabic languages, we are both 100% correct.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And while the decision of where I would place them in an ordered list will likely be after <STRONG>ح</STRONG> and <STRONG>u</STRONG>,on the arbitrary basis&nbsp;they look&nbsp;a bit like them,&nbsp;it is not&nbsp;really going to be the same for languages that might make use of the characters.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Where they might be placed in the alphabetical order of a language that makes use of <STRONG>ڇ</STRONG> or <STRONG>ṻ</STRONG> is likely be very different. Since our answer was on the basis of ignorance of what the&nbsp;letter is, it would only make sense that their knowledge of the letter and what it does will guide their notion of where it belongs alphabetically.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>This is an issue that I will be posting about in the future, with some more specific examples, giving both the "ignorant" and "knowledgable" viewpoints....</P></FONT>

<hr/><p><a id="530733" href="#530733">#</a> <strong>Gabe</strong> on 13 Feb 2006 12:21 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">This is an interesting topic. For one thing, these scripts (Hebrew, Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, and Arabic) were all derived from the old Phoenician, so they all inherited the same order. (In fact, it is my belief that the Phoenicians invented the concept of &quot;alphabetical order&quot;.) Are there any other languages that had a defined collation order before standardized orders were required by governments?<br><br>The thing is, letters that were not used sometimes were left out and new letters were sometimes added. This is interesting because it raises the issue of where new letters are to be added. <br><br>Some people added new letters only where old ones were deleted. For example, we have 'G' in the current position because that's where 'Z' was. Since the 'Z' wasn't being used, the 'G' (derived from 'C') was put in its place in order to maintain the alphabetical order.<br><br>In other cases new letters were added to the end of the alphabet. The 'Z' is last in English because it was later borrowed back from Greek (along with 'Y').<br><br>And the last option is to put new letters after what they are derived from, which is why 'J' (the consonant form of 'I') is right after 'I', and 'V' &amp; 'W' are after 'U'.<br><br>See <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.evertype.com/standards/wynnyogh/thorn.html">http://www.evertype.com/standards/wynnyogh/thorn.html</a> for an interesting discussion of where to put the Latin letter thorn.</div>

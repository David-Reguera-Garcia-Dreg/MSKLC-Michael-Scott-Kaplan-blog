<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The other day, Tracey asked me:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><EM>hi, i was searching the internet for how to buy bulk /cases of trader joe products when i came across your site. im so totally addicted to their fruit laces and organic fruit leathers. at 27 cents each they are a real bargain compared to other stores. but i hate driving 40mins to gedt them each week or two and having to feel like a fool while they count up 30 of each flavor. they always laugh and say i must have a real sweet tooth. i embarrass easily i guess but anhow it would be so much easier to just pay at once for a whole case. so my question is how do u go about ordering from them? through the company or direct to the store location? </EM></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Cool, another Limonata-related post!</FONT></P>
<P><IMG src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B0001FR0B6.01-A3OSY57YTXMHNX.LZZZZZZZ.jpg"></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I actually call ahead and ask them to set aside the number of cases I want, and it works quite well. I don't even have the excuse of a 40-minute drive since they are just a few minutes down the road, and they never give me a hard time.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But they do their orders every day and they'll set aside what you ask them to. In the absolute worst case, if you call after they have made the daily order, you will have to wait two days instead of one.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>In my experiences in both Washington state and California they are always quite helpful. :-)</FONT></P>

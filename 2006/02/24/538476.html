I am disappointed by the results Google returned to me; evidently this meaning of the word doesn't commonly (or at all?) exists.</p></div>

<p><strong>DespicableMe</strong> on 24 Jan 2011 4:58 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Unicide is what Dr. Evil and every super villian in movies is trying to accomplish. Think of how many people are involved in the word suicide, just yourself right? well what about homicide, someone else. and now think what is one step above genocide... complete universe anihalation. Thats right, but you must remember universe means all existence. Beyond our world, solar system, galaxy, etc. It is a irrational thought, but one that if it is considered, it would cross the mind of an equally evil and dillusional person.</p>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It was over a year ago that I pointed out in the post <A HREF="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/01/21/357960.html"><STRONG>Keyboards: hardware vs. software</STRONG></A> how disconnected our team (which owns most of the keyboard layouts) and the hardware team (which owns most of the actual keyboard hardware) were.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And how impressive it was that we managed to be in sync so often, given that disconnect.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But it is possible I may live the rest of my life without being able to understand why almost every keyboard layout has a key which, when typed, will produce <STRONG>|</STRONG> (<A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/007c">U+007c</A>, a.k.a. VERTICAL LINE) yet printed upon the face of the key is <STRONG>¦</STRONG> (<A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/00a6">U+00a6</A>, a.k.a. BROKEN BAR).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>What's up with that?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It turns out that every single byte code page other <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/reference/sbcs/874.mspx">874</A> of the <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/reference/WinCP.mspx">Windows code pages</A> supports <A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/00a6">U+00a6</A>, and every single <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/reference/WinCP.mspx">Windows code page</A> bar none (pardon the pun) supports <A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/007c">U+007c</A>.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And just about every font that has one has the other.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Even though in most cases (to get back to keyboards) almost every keyboard prints one on theface of a key but the matching layout has the other input.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So why this disconnect?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And more importantly, why does it persist?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And most important of all, why don't people complain? In either direction?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I suspect it is because no one really cares.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Or maybe is just that two guys can walk into a bar. Even if it looks like it is broken. Since it turns out they&nbsp;may still be serving drinks....</FONT></P>

I would assume that IBM decided the bar should be broken, so it made the original PC with a broken bar on the keyboard and in the graphics card fonts. Later on when Microsoft started implementing fonts of course they implemented the ANSI standard solid bar, but nobody ever thought to change the keyboard.<br><br>At some point I guess ISO decided that the broken bar was still useful (backcompat maybe?), so they assigned it a code point in the upper half of the charset.</div>

I certainly didn't know what was printed on that key until you prompted me to look.<br><br>Of course, on a UK keyboard the | symbol is on an extra key between the Z and the left shift key. A key which doesn't exist at all on a US keyboard! We also have a second extra key between the &quot; (which is really the @ key!) and the enter key, which has on it # and ~. I've often wondered why the UK keyboard is so different from the US one, since the only extra symbol you get is the British pound sign in the place of # on the 3 key.<br><br>My laptop has a US keyboard, and I initially tried to use the UK keymap on it despite the lying key captions, but I soon found out that I had four symbols I could no longer type due to the missing keys. Quite frustrating.<br></div>

And anyone who used it certainly did care, because it meant that pipe operators didn't work and you couldn't write C programs in a DOS IDE.</div>

I guess this was because the younger children hadn't learned about uppercase characters yet.<br><br>Now that computers are highly prevalent in schools, I wonder if they go to the effort of getting in lowercase-captioned keyboards or if they now just expect the kids to deal with it. After all, my old primary school — now largely refurbished and currently host to the next generation of my family — has several rooms devoted to computers, whereas in my day we had just roughly one per class of 30 children and they were generally just used to play educational computer games once in a blue moon. (I was &quot;computer monitor&quot; when I was seven or eight years old! Gotta start young!)<br></div>
<p><a id="539262" href="#539262">#</a> <strong>Gabe</strong> on Saturday, February 25, 2006 4:55 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">My understanding of the 1967 decision was that PL/I users needed a vertical bar, and IBM's user group wanted it to be among the upper case letters because not everybody had lower case at the time. Since PL/I didn't use the exclamation mark, and it is essentially a vertical line, they said that you could make your exclamation mark look like a vertical bar. Of course then people with full 7-bit charsets would still have the real vertical bar character and the only way to visually tell them apart would be to have a hole in the U+7C character.<br><br>Of course this was stupid and was fixed 10 years later, but IBM apparently never got the memo.</div>

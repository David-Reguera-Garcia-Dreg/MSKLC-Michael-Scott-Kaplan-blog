<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2><EM>Warning: if the site censors this post I'll probably pull it down and repost after I find out how to avoid the censors, maybe with a bit of phishing! :-)</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>A small riff on Language Log's Geoffrey K. Pullum, and his post <A href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002843.html">I didn't write shit today</A>....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Mike Dolenga and I have joked&nbsp;in the past&nbsp;about how some days you feel like you wasted way too much time -- maybe in investigating a bug but going down the wrong path, or unintentionally checking in code that turned out to have a bug, or just approaching an algorithm the wrong way and needing to just start over, or whatever.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Where sometimes we'd almost want to go to Julie's office and slap a $20 or $50 or $100 bill on her desk (amount of money based on the seriousness of the time wasted by the mistake).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Just to symbolically apologize for wasting the time, or for </FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>checking that shit in....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Now simultaneously, the phrase has the same sort of slang meaning that the expression usually suggests, which is&nbsp;perhaps more of an <STRONG>I didn't </STRONG><FONT color=#808080>[even]</FONT><STRONG> check in shit today</STRONG><FONT color=#808080>[, let alone the&nbsp;quality code I was supposed to]</FONT><STRONG>.</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Or perhaps it is better stated as the difference between:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><EM>didn't check in <STRONG>shit</STRONG> today</EM></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>versus</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><EM>didn't check <STRONG>shit</STRONG> in today</EM></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Of course it depends on intonation too, and I could provide audio examples as WAV or WMA files.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But I am not really going to start podcasting just to allow people to have a recording of me using swear words with different intonations.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Although both phrases could go either way, it is interesting to me how the meaning is different when you emphasize that one word.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Try it to yourself a few times, (if you are not writing code for a living, this specific test will not work with Geoffrey's formulation since he does not have the preposition in there, but I think the context is self explanatory).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Why does the meaning seem to change with the word order, if the words emphasized do not?</FONT></P>

<p><a id="535214" href="#535214">#</a> <strong>Mark Steward</strong> on Sunday, February 19, 2006 8:45 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Actually, I reckon &quot;[to do] shit&quot; is so regularly used in this sense that it's gained (perhaps by analogy with &quot;[to do] FA&quot;) a specialised meaning of &quot;[to do] nothing&quot;. &nbsp;So very few people (that I know) think of the implied &quot;even&quot;.<br><br>I think that's probably why (guessing at your intonation) there's a difference - in the form &quot;check shit in&quot;, the group &quot;check shit&quot; is parsed as a unit of its own, followed by &quot;in&quot;. &nbsp;Whereas &quot;check in&quot;, when read as a verb, fits the familiar pattern above, as the shit is intoned separately.<br><br>If you stress &quot;shit&quot; enough in the second one, its negative sense overcomes the strange grammar. &nbsp;Similarly, in &quot;I didn't do *nothing*&quot;, stressing nothing the right way can change the double-negative to an intensified negative.<br><br>Can't believe I just wrote all the above - I must be really desperate to get away from my essay.</div>

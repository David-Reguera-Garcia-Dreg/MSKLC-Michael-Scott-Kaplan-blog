<h1>ELK cultures for other platforms</h1>
<p><em>by Michael S. Kaplan, published on 2006/02/07 03:01 -05:00, original URI: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/michkap/archive/2006/02/07/526339.aspx</em></p>

<p><font face=Tahoma>Ever since that first post about ELKs (<strong><a HREF="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/01/26/360685.html">Lions and tigers and <strike><font color=#808080>bears</font></strike>ELKs, Oh my!</a></strong>) there has been a lot of interest in this mechanism. But that is not the only thing that generates interest.</font></p>
<p><font face=Tahoma>For example, Dieter&nbsp;asked the following question in the microsoft.public.win32.programmer.international newsgroup:</font></p>
<blockquote dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=2><em>I am passing 'hr-ba' to the construcutor of .NET Framework 2.0 class CultureInfo.&nbsp;Works fine in XP 2000, fails in Windows Server 2003 with message:</em></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=2><em>Culture name 'hr-ba' is not supported.<br />Parameter name: name</em></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=2><em>I have noticed that hr-ba is not in the lsit of supported cultures of&nbsp;CultureInfo documentation, but in blog entry </em></font><a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/shawnste/archive/2005/12/06/500675.aspx"><font face="Times New Roman" size=2><em>http://blogs.msdn.com/shawnste/archive/2005/12/06/500675.aspx</em></font></a><font face="Times New Roman" size=2><em> I have read&nbsp;that the CultureInfo is built up from os infos.</em></font></p>
<p><font face=Tahoma><font face="Times New Roman" size=2><em>Any suggestions what I have to make it work on Windows Server 2003? Is there a setup available that installs that additional cultures available&nbsp;in XP Prof. and not in Windows Server 2003?</em></font></font></p></blockquote>
<p><font face=Tahoma>It is important to remember that these 'Windows only" CultureInfo&nbsp;objects are simply not designed to work on all platforms. They just aren't.</font></p>
<p><font face=Tahoma>Now if someone who was using the exciting new Welsh locale in XP SP2 was not able to see it in their managed applications, they would be complaining pretty loudly.</font></p>
<p><font face=Tahoma>Of course now there will obviously be people unhappy with the fact that these new cultures will not be on all platforms.</font></p>
<p><font face=Tahoma>I think the problem is that developers like to complain. I know, because that is what I used to do anytime I wasn't getting what I wanted. :-)</font></p>
<p><font face=Tahoma>(Maybe that isn't even as past tense as I like to think!)</font></p>
<p><font face=Tahoma>Now it is true that&nbsp;there is no mechanism to add locales to a platform that does not have them other than the ELKs (which are not currently available&nbsp;for Server 2003, as I mentioned in <a HREF="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/12/17/504924.html"><strong>ELKs aren't roaming where the servers are</strong></a>). And while I have learned since I started working for Microsoft it is that one can never say never, there is obviously no way that Dieter's immediate need will be met directly. Even if everything changed.</font></p><font face=Tahoma>
<p><font face=Tahoma>But&nbsp;don't worry, there is a definite workaround here to get things up and running.</font></p>
<p>After all, there is certainly a mechanism to add cultures to the 2.0 version of the .NET Framework -- CUSTOM CULTURES!</p></font>
<p><font face=Tahoma>That's right, you can create a custom culture based on the Windows only one, save it as LDML, copy that file to the other machine (Server 2003, Windows 2000, even Window 98/ME), and register it.</font></p>
<p><font face=Tahoma>Dieter tried it out and responded back with:</font></p>
<blockquote dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p><em><font face="Times New Roman" size=2>Thanks for the hint with the LDML file. It worked for me.</font></em></p></blockquote>
<p><font face=Tahoma>And now, with that same format now being supported in new versions of Windows, the ability to level the playing field will only become easier in the future, for both managed and unmanaged code.</font></p>

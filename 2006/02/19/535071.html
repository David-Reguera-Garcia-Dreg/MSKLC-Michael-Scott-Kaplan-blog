<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Last weekend, </FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>I went to see <A href="http://duncansheik.com/">Duncan Sheik</A> last weekend at <A href="http://tripledoor.net/">The Triple Door</A> in Seattle.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It was funny, I had bought a couple of tickets and I had also put up some flyers for his management so my name was at the door for myself and a guest, too -- so I found myself with the equivalent of four tickets....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But&nbsp;most</FONT><FONT face=Tahoma> of the people who I would have thought to ask to go to such a show (due to me mentioning previously that I might do such a thing!)&nbsp;were either&nbsp;away (e.g. Kevin and Cathy were on vacation) or working (e.g. <A href="http://kristinconnell.com/">Kristin</A> was in Omak doing a show of her own).</FONT></P><FONT face=Tahoma>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Now Kristin told me later that her show went really well, but she did wish she could have gone. I first met her when she was opening for Jim Boggia, who was also opening for Duncan at The Triple Door. Some sort of synchrony there? :-)</FONT></P>
<P>Anyway,&nbsp;it was just Teresa and I at the show.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I don't mind supporting artists I like so I did not mind that I had bought two tickets that I did not need.&nbsp;As&nbsp;it turns out, I'm&nbsp;not sure whether it was being "on the list" or riding in with the scooter that got us sitting right up front. Either way we had a great view of the whole show....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Let me start by saying I had never been to this venue before, but at least from where we were both the sound and the show were awesome. I will definitely keep my eye&nbsp;on their schedule for the future.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Ok, so <A href="http://jimboggia.com/">Jim Boggia</A> came out and opened up, and the venue already looked pretty full. It seems like there were a few serious Boggiafilees in the crowd as people seemed very enthusiastic. An awesome opener, I wish I had a setlist but I forgot to bring a pen. :-(</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But as usual his performance was great; he is a classic. He actually said some great things about Teddy and Duncan on the tour (I did not know who Teddy was at the time, I guess I assumed he was in the band?)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>After he did his set, he came down right past us and saw us sitting there -- and remembered us from The Green Room, which was awesome. I swear I am junkie for that sort of thing -- you know, any time someone way more famous than me remembers who I am? That is just really cool.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I just looked over on his <A href="http://jimboggia.com/blog.asp">blog</A> (sorry, no RSS feed!) and saw a rather amusing story of being apparently locked in the trailer at two minutes to showtime.&nbsp;The story&nbsp;is very Jim, I highly recommend it.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Anyway, we chatted for a few minutes before he headed over to the merchandise table. I think the couple sitting to our left were impressed....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And then, there was a <EM>second</EM> opener! The Teddy that Jim referred to was&nbsp;<A href="http://www.teddythompson.com/">Teddy Thompson</A>, who&nbsp;came out and played for a bit. Teresa had been chatting with the folks next to us (something I doubt I will ever be as good at -- having conversations is easy for me; starting them is not). A</FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>nd after Teddy was done and&nbsp;came out, our neighbor was posing for a picture with Teddy which Teresa was taking with her cellular phone. Who says technology isn't grand? :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Ok, then the time came and out popped Duncan, playing a great, relaxed yet nevertheless intense set (which is how I have always seen Duncan -- very laid back yet with an emotional intenity in his songs that is at times palpable).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>About halfway though, <A href="http://www.davidpoe.com/">David Poe</A> came out and did a few songs with Duncan, and David mentiond that he and Duncan were forming a new band. I will definitely keep and eye out for what's going on there....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Anyway I had found a pen by that time, but was still hampered a bit by the fact that I do not know all of songs (and am a bit hampered now by how bloody awful my handwriting is!). Here is the setlist as best as I was able to manage:</FONT></P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Nothing Fades</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Good Morning</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>For You</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Fantastic Toys And Corduroys</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Start Again</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Genius</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Wishful Thinking</FONT></LI></UL>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>This is the point where David Poe came out. They performed two songs and I have no idea what the titles are, at all -- so here I am listing what the topic was for each:</FONT></P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Sex</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Death</FONT></LI></UL>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>(Sorry, maybe someone else was there who recognized them?)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>(David stayed on the stage for the next song)</FONT></P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>White Limousine</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>I Don't Believe In Ghosts</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>The Dawn's Request</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Memento</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Hey Casanova</FONT></LI></UL>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The band left the stage but people started cheering and we got our encore:</FONT></P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Chess <EM>(well, maybe this is Mr. Chess? Not sure....)</EM></FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>She Runs Away</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Home</FONT></LI></UL>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>We waited for people to file out (an interesting consequence of the venue's "accessible ramp that snakes through the entire club, row by row" that the <A href="http://tripledoor.net/mainstage.aspx">Mainstage</A> uses is that it is hard to fight against the traffic heading in the opposite direction to get to the stairs at each level).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But I didn't mind, it was fun to overhear comments from others and see that everyone else enjoyed the show too.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>All and all, a very nice Saturday night show to be at -- folks getting to see Duncan and Jim play at subsequent shows in the White Limousine tour are in for a treat!</FONT></P>

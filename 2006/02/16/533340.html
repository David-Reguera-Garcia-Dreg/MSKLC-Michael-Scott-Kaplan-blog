<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><EM>Why is "space" U+0020 not a control character, but "horizontal tab" U+0009 is? </EM></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I can't really answer for the Unicode Consortium on such points, such as why <A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0020">U+0020</A> is of the Unicode general category <A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/category/Zs/index.htm">Zs</A> (Separator, space) and <A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0009">U+0009</A> is of the Unicode general category <A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/category/Cc/index.htm">Cc</A> (Other, control) in an authoritative way.... :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Though it is pretty easy to see how people generally consider the space to be different than the tab, since the latter gets into the whole realm of rich text&nbsp;when you consider features like tab stops and such.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The space is pretty&nbsp;common in most languages as a word breaker, a feature that the tab in theory could do but generally doesn't in ordinary usage. Even in plain text the tab has specific functionality in common practice like something to start a new paragraph.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So why are characters in the categories they are in? Usage usually drives the decisions, since the data that Unicode provides like the general category is expected to be picked up by implementations to guide behavior. The best answer, therefore, can be gleaned by looking at what the general category is meant to do, what implementations are supposed to do with it....</FONT></P>

I don't have any delusions of linguistic aptitude at all ;) but I've always believed that gamma was, pretty much by definition, a greek character...</div>

<p><a id="533632" href="#533632">#</a> <strong>Michael Dunn_</strong> on 16 Feb 2006 4:57 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Perhaps the letters used in IPA are classified as Latin? &nbsp;IPA uses beta, theta, phi, and two versions of gamma (and maybe others that I'm forgetting).</div>
<p><a id="533673" href="#533673">#</a> <strong>Anthony Mills</strong> on 16 Feb 2006 5:35 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">It's a control character because in ASCII the characters 0-31 were control characters and 32-127 were printable characters.<br><br>Control characters were, of course, the ones that weren't actually printed but just jumped the terminal cursor around (13, 10, 9), beeped (7), form-fed the printer (12), etc.<br><br>So there you go. It's a control character because of legacy reasons.</div>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Yesterday, when I posted Every character has a story #19: U+200c and U+200d (ZERO WIDTH [NON] JOINER), I got an interesting <A HREF="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/02/15/532394.html#533011">comment</A> from Yosuke HASEGAWA:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><EM>Using ZERO WIDTH (NON) JOINER or ZWNBSP(BOM) to filename or registory key and values, you can create several files that appearance is the same name. </EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><EM>This may cause visual problems in security domain. So I hope to disable using Unicode control characters for filename in Windows. <BR>Of course, Bidi control characters such as "RLO" too. </EM></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Anyone who feels that way really needs to look at the two Unicode Technical Reports I mentioned:</FONT></P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>UTR #36: <A href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr36/tr36-4.html">Unicode Security Considerations</A></FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>UTR #39: <A href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr39/tr39-1.html">Unicode Security Mechanisms</A></FONT></LI></UL>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It is not merely a matter of invalidating some characters, as these UTRs make perfectly clear....</FONT></P><FONT face=Tahoma>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Add to that the legacy issue and the whole <STRONG>Uppercase and Binary</STRONG> world of the Microsoft Windows namespace and you are left with a very difficult problem -- one that is not really solved by disallowing a few characters since security problems on a local machine are not generally caused by confusable&nbsp;characters!</FONT></P>
<P>And that gets even more complicated when there are core strings that need to be used which, if they were not allowed would cause significant linguistic and political issues (as I pointed out yesterday).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Now with that said:</FONT></P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>The&nbsp;most recent&nbsp;<A href="http://www.unicode.org/consortium/utc.html">Unicode Technical Committee</A> meeting was last week, and we spent over a day of our four days working on various security topics raised in StringPrep, International Domain Names, and more;</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>the first author listed on both of those reports is Michel Suignard, a Microsoft employee who is actually on the GIFT team.</FONT><FONT face=Tahoma> This is an area in which we are clearly interested and are trying to help define how to&nbsp;help mitigate&nbsp;these problems on a the very wide scale of the entire internet;</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>This issue has a prominent place in one of my presentations at the <A HREF="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/11/21/495389.html">29th Internationalization and Unicode Conference</A> (the one entitled <A href="http://www.unicodeconference.org/program-d.htm#Kaplan_S9">Tales of Incorrect String Comparisons</A>).</FONT></LI></UL>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So nobody is ignoring the fact that there is a problem here, a problem&nbsp;that must <EM>not</EM> be ignored.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But nobody in Microsoft is planning on making a few cosmetic changes and calling themselves secure afterward, either. If you know what I mean....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

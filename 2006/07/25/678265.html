<P>Because the Afrikaans <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=0db2e8f9-79c4-4625-a07a-0cc1b341be7c&amp;displaylang=af">Language Interface Pack</A> is now available!</P>
<P>Some info about Afrikaans:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT size=2><STRONG>Number of speakers</STRONG>: 4 million </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><STRONG>Name in the language itself</STRONG>: Afrikaans </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Afrikaans is one of the 11 official languages of South Africa and is spoken mainly in the western one-third of the country, especially the Northern Cape and Western Cape provinces. After Zulu and Xhosa, Afrikaans has the third-largest language community in South Africa. It is also spoken in the neighboring country of Namibia. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>The language is a heritage of the Dutch colonization of areas of today’s South Africa from the 17th century onwards – which is why it was originally known as “Kaaps-Hollands” (“Cape Dutch”). It gained loanwords from languages of others settlers (mainly English, French and German) and the surrounding African people and underwent grammatical simplification and some phonetic changes. Afrikaans became a literary language about a century ago after it had been a spoken language only, and it replaced Standard Dutch (which had been the written language until then) officially in 1925.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><STRONG>Fun facts</STRONG>:</FONT></P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT size=2>Afrikaans is the only language that has its own monument: The Afrikaans Language Monument (Afrikaanse Taalmonument) is located near Paarl in the the Western Cape Province and was completed 1975.</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT size=2>A famous English loan word from Afrikaans is trek (as in Star Trek). It means long, hard journey.</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT size=2>Afrikaans has a double negative like the French ne ... pas which is used with composite verb forms: Hy het niks gedoen nie is literally He has nothing done not.</FONT></LI></UL>
<P><FONT size=2><STRONG>Classification</STRONG>:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Afrikaans is principally derived from the same 16th-century Dutch dialect that led to modern Dutch and is closely related to that language. Both belong to the West Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family. Afrikaans is the youngest Germanic language.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><STRONG>Script</STRONG>:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Latin script, 26 letters (like in English), with c, q, x, and z rarely being used. There are special characters: è, é, ê, ë, î, ï, ô, û</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Enjoy!</P>

<p><a id="678533" href="#678533">#</a> <strong>Maurits</strong> on Tuesday, July 25, 2006 11:06 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Originally one trekked across the veld[t], but Star Trek was popular in South Africa too :)</div>
<p><a id="679204" href="#679204">#</a> <strong>Paul Clapham</strong> on Wednesday, July 26, 2006 1:10 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Perhaps the post should have been brought to us by U+0149, a.k.a. LATIN SMALL LETTER N PRECEDED BY APOSTROPHE -- a character that as far as I know is only used in Afrikaans?</div>
<p><a id="679304" href="#679304">#</a> <strong>Ruben</strong> on Wednesday, July 26, 2006 2:47 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Indeed. But I believe that 'n is just as dubious as the precomposed ij character. Note that Dutch also uses 'n (short for een, as English 'a, an'), but it's never seen as a precomposed character, just an aportrophe followed by a consonant.<br><br>Having 'n as a seperate character does spare you the trouble of quasi-intelligent word processors that automatically type opening quotes rather than an apostrophe. Now if only I could find a keyboard containing that character... <br><br>Dutch has more than just 'n though: 'k, 'm, 'n, 'r, 's and 't. All informal except for 's; in written text one usually uses ik [I], hem [him], een [a, an], haar [her], het [it], but never des ('s) [in/at/of the].</div>
<p><a id="679411" href="#679411">#</a> <strong>legolas</strong> on Wednesday, July 26, 2006 4:31 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Are you sure it's 'gedoen', and not 'gedaan' in afrikaans? It's 'gedaan' in Dutch and 'gedoen' sounds really crazy, even for afrikaans (which already sounds like funny Dutch sometimes).</div>
<p><a id="679835" href="#679835">#</a> <strong>vedala</strong> on Thursday, July 27, 2006 12:43 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">What I noticed the sequence of the following characters:<br>&amp;#xc24;&amp;#xc46;&amp;#xc32;&amp;#xc41;&amp;#xc17;&amp;#xc41;<br>(తెలుగు) &nbsp; looks wrong. Instead of reading &quot;Telugu&quot; &nbsp;it reads as &quot;Tha-ey-lu-gu&quot; &nbsp;. The second character should actually appear on top of first character thus making totally three characters (Te-lu-gu). Here is the pronunciation of the language &quot;Telugu&quot;:<br>&quot;Te&quot; as in &quot;[The]spian&quot;, &quot;Lu&quot; and &quot;gu&quot; as in &quot;[Lo]op&quot; and &quot;[go]od&quot; respectively. <br>Cheers.</div>
<p><a id="679905" href="#679905">#</a> <strong>Willie</strong> on Thursday, July 27, 2006 2:07 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">The only context I can think of for the word trek is to move house, usually associated in South Africa with picking up to two guys from the street corner to do the heavy lifting, and getting a case of beer for your mates to help.<br><br>Gedoen is correct. Prefixing verbs with ge in Afrikaans makes it past tense, so &quot;Hy het niks gedoen nie&quot; is past tense for &quot;Hy doen niks nie&quot;.<br><br>It's really strange to read the Afrikaans pages on the Microsoft download site. This is not at all how we speak the language, at least not my generation. This is not due to bad localization from Microsoft and local Afrikaans publication also write this way. <br><br>Unfortunately this doesn't install on 2003, I'll have to install XP today, if only for amusement reasons.<br></div>

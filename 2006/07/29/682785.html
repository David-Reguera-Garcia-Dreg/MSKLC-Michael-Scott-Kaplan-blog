<P>Now how does that saying go?</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><STRONG>I</STRONG> before <STRONG>E</STRONG>, except after <STRONG>C,</STRONG><BR>Or when it sound like 'A', like in N<STRONG><FONT color=#ff0000 size=5>ei</FONT></STRONG>ghbor and W<STRONG><FONT color=#ff0000 size=5>ei</FONT></STRONG>gh,<BR>Or when it sound like 'Ear', like in the word W<STRONG><FONT color=#ff0000 size=5>ei</FONT></STRONG>rd,<BR>Unless it sound like 'Eek', like in Duncan Sh<STRONG><FONT color=#ff0000 size=5>ei</FONT></STRONG>k!</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Ok, I added that last part in. But in my defense I do have that built-in appreciation for singer/songwriters, and it is how his name is spelled. But what do you expect me to do, when <A href="http://www.duncansheik.com/">Duncan Sheik</A> is playing in Seattle tonight? :-)</P>
<P>That's right, he will be at <A href="http://www.chopsuey.com/">Chop Suey</A>, playing with <A href="http://viennateng.com/">Vienna Teng</A>. Doors open at 9pm.</P>
<P>You can get tickets <A href="http://www.ticketweb.com/user/?region=wa&amp;query=detail&amp;event=676278">here</A>&nbsp;(from TicketWeb), and if you happen to see me scooting along then feel free to say hi and mention if you heard about the show reading here! :-)</P>
<P>If I get up the nerve, I'll ask Duncan if the 'Mark Liberman' in the "<EM>Thanks to:</EM>" section of the liner notes in his newest album (White Limosine) is the Penn linguist I've mentioned in the past....</P></FONT>

At the age of 12 I thought myself very witty for coming up with this brilliant double-meaning. Of course, like many of my brilliant childhood accomplishments, I've since come to realise that (obviously) I was far from the first person to have this particular idea.</div>

(see <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/sheik">http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/sheik</a> for more details)<br><br>A few weeks ago I posted a fairly exhaustive list of the exceptions to the rule: &nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://rnblog.theoslogic.com/2006/07/weird.html">http://rnblog.theoslogic.com/2006/07/weird.html</a></div>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I talked about them a bit in the post <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/06/13/629804.html"><STRONG>Size matters (when it comes to day names, at least)</STRONG></A>. They are known as the 'shortest day names' and are retreived by calling <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/intl/nls_34rz.asp">GetLocaleInfo</A> with one of the LOCALE_SHORTESTDAYNAME# <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/intl/nls_8rse.asp">LCTYPE</A> constants.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Now if you look at them for a few locales, say like en-US:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face="Courier New"><STRONG>Mo;Tu;We;Th;Fr;Sa;Su;</STRONG></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>or for fr-FR:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face="Courier New"><STRONG>lu;ma;me;je;ve;sa;di;</STRONG></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>or for hu-HU:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face="Courier New"><STRONG>V;H;K;Sze;Cs;P;Szo;</STRONG></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>you will see a pattern emerging.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Basically, folks decided that each day's shortest name should be unambiguous.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>This weekend I am back in Cleveland for my grandmother's 90th birthday. And I was sitting at the kitchen table looking at somebody's pill case, and noticed that the letters on the "doors" for each of the seven days were:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><STRONG><FONT face="Courier New">S&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;W&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S</FONT></STRONG></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>and suddenly I realized something.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The purpose of the shortest day names was to support the creation of CALENDAR displays, like in Outlook and the <STRONG><A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/12/21/506427.html">updated Vista MonthCal/DateTimePicker</A></STRONG>.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>In the context of those types of calendars (or similar UI like those pill cases), is anyone ever going to mistake <STRONG>T</STRONG>uesday for <STRONG>T</STRONG>hursday? Or <STRONG>S</STRONG>aturday for <STRONG>S</STRONG>unday? Or <STRONG>m</STRONG>ardi for <STRONG>m</STRONG>ercredi? Or <STRONG>s</STRONG>zerda for <STRONG>s</STRONG>zombat?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Obviously not!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Now clearly for languages like Welsh, where the day names are:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><STRONG><FONT face="Courier New">Dydd Llun;Dydd Mawrth;Dydd Mercher;Dydd Iau;Dydd Gwener;Dydd Sadwrn;Dydd Sul;</FONT></STRONG></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>and Hebrew, where&nbsp;six of the&nbsp;day names start with <STRONG>יום</STRONG>, </FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>it makes sense to use a different one letter than the first letter of the full day name. But that does not invalidate the idea under which this NLS data&nbsp;field was originally born -- the <STRONG>ONE LETTER DAY NAME</STRONG>, now does it?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><EM>(by the way, the Hebrew shortest day names are one letter each!)</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I'm just saying.... :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<p><a id="663719" href="#663719">#</a> <strong>Michael Dunn_</strong> on 12 Jul 2006 4:34 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">In my college class listings, they used the one-letter abbreviations M T W R F S Z <br>That was a case where space was at a premium, and you couldn't tell whether &quot;T&quot; meant Tuesday or Thursday from the context.</div>
<p><a id="665510" href="#665510">#</a> <strong>Andr&#233; Szabolcs Szelp</strong> on 14 Jul 2006 7:06 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Well, you did not get it quite right with Hungarian.<br><br>The &quot;shortest&quot; abbreviations<br>H K Sze Cs P Szo V (for h&#233;tfő, kedd szerda, cs&#252;t&#246;rt&#246;k, p&#233;ntek, szombat, vas&#225;rnap)<br>are not only customary and have not only been used in calendar views in print (!) for decades, but there comes in an additional factor:<br><br>In Hungarian there are several multi-character graphemes (using Unicode terminology) (a lot of digraphs and one trigraph), such is the CS in cs&#252;t&#246;rt&#246;k and SZ in szerda and szombat respectively. Those, which are called graphemes in Unicode (they have stopped using &quot;letter&quot; for the ambiguity of grapheme--character notion) are considered letters in hungarian: the atomic parts of the script; such, S is a letter and SZ is a separate letter.<br><br>Therefore, even if you'd abbreviate the weekdays one letter only,<br>it would still be H K Sz Cs P Sz V. Abbreviating of /sz.*/ as /s/ (as well as /cs.*/ as /c/ or /dzs.*/ as /d/, /ty.*/ as /t/) is forbidden by hungarian orthography, writing traditon _and_ customary use (I'm stressing this, because there occure situations, when writing &quot;rules&quot; [orthography] is out of sync the needs of the writer community. But here, that's definitely not the case). And if you have -- in terms of characters -- more than one occasionally, _and_ a tradition even in print, why not stick with it? H K Sze Cs P Szo V is used by everyone, and no-one (who actually uses it) has ever complained about that.<br><br>Yeah, things become interesting, when people start ruling and judging about matter they are not _actually_ involved with.</div>
<p><a id="665728" href="#665728">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 14 Jul 2006 11:13 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Hi Andr&#233;,<br><br>Yes, I understand wanting to keep the user opinion about a character intact -- but if the name gets too long then it will end up being truncated by the UI, which is arguably a worse situation than if the truncation is intentionally planned, after careful consideration. :-)<br><br>But I think of the situation with Hungarian as similar to the English one - and the duplication of Sz is really not as bad as it may seem (though perhaps it is okay since when it truncates it will look like Sz anyway?).<br><br>Out of curiousity, what does Outlook do in its tiny calendar view?</div>

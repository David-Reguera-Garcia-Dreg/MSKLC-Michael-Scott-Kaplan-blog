<P><FONT face=Tahoma>In the spirit of <STRONG><A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/08/25/456496.html">the milk bet</A></STRONG>, I got the following invite yesterday: </FONT></P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT size=2>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face=Garamond size=3>As some of you have heard by now, there is something known as a Saltine challenge. The goal is to eat 7 saltines in 60 seconds. If you're interested and well-hydrated, join us in ##/#### tomorrow :) </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Garamond size=3>Cheers,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Garamond size=3>Sushmita</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE></FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Group morale events have clearly reached a new high (or perhaps a new low, it is all a matter of perspective!).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Yes, there is indeed The Saltine Challenge, which you can read a bit about <A href="http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2005/03/the-saltine-challenge">here</A> and <A href="http://www.drmomentum.com/challenge/saltine_challenge.html">here</A> and <A href="http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=483009">here</A> and <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saltine">here</A> (or do your own searches, it is a popular bit of folklore). Obviously&nbsp;some of&nbsp;those on the NLS and MST teams plan to outdo the original Nabisco ad campaign and do <STRONG>seven</STRONG> crackers, not just six....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>For those participating, Mike (another Mike, not the Mike who was formerly ours) explains <A href="http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2005/03/the-saltine-challenge#3094">the chunking strategy</A>: </FONT></P><FONT face=Tahoma>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face=Garamond>Alright, I'll give up the goods on the chunking method now:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Garamond>Basically, if you eat three, then two, then one, it seems quite a bit easier to accomplish the feat. The idea is that by getting three out of the way in one swoop while you're still somewhat wet, you're slaying half the beast right away. Doing one right after the other is bad because you're pretty much bone dry after only the first cracker, and doing all six right away is bad because that's just too much cracker to break down.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Garamond>Incidentally, when I did seven, it was with a 4-3 strategy. Still haven't been able to do a 4-4 yet though. And I wonder why my mouth is so scratched up this week...</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE></FONT>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>He was able to evedntually do <A href="http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2005/03/the-saltine-challenge#3373">eight saltines</A>, using a 3-3-2 strategy.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And then Mike (the first Mike, the one who was formerly ours) took a break from producing humorous and not-for-public-sharing build break haiku poems to provide the following little ditty:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><STRONG><FONT face=Arial>oodles of saltines<BR>all stuffed into my dry mouth<BR>I so want to puke</FONT></STRONG></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Of course, I think it might be fun to try to combine the two bets somehow -- though milk and cookies is a more conventional combination than milk and crackers. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Got milk?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Linguist, colleague, and GIFT Program Manager Kieran Snyder has finally created a blog here on blogs.msdn.com. The title is <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/kierans/">Loneliness of the long-distance linguist</A>,&nbsp;and her 'hello&nbsp;world' post is <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/kierans/archive/2006/07/19/671961.aspx">right here</A>.</FONT></P><FONT face=Tahoma>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I was half expecting that she would start posting over at <A href="http://www.languagelog.com/">Language Log Plaza</A>, the virtual pavilion that seems to cover a large portion of the known world, but I think it is great that she decided to start here with several thousand of our closest friends. :-)</FONT></P>
<P>Trivia -- I actually did read her dissertation (THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FORM AND FUNCTION IN DITRANSITIVE CONSTRUCTIONS), way back when. </P>
<P>I admit I did not understand some of it. Well, most of it. But that's why I tell people that what I have is notions of linguistic aptitude!</P>
<P>In any case, definitely one for the list of <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2004/12/18/325156.html"><STRONG>blogs I read</STRONG></A>....</FONT></P>

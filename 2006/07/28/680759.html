<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Remember earlier this month when I was talking about the <STRONG><A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/07/16/667468.html">Update to the mitigation tools for IDN security problems</A></STRONG>? </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Well, it turns out that Wikipedia has an external link to the tools in its <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_domain_name">Internationalized Domain Names</A> article. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Unfortunately, they are pointing at the old download site of the 1.0 tools I posted about <STRONG><A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/08/20/454144.html">originally</A></STRONG>. A link that no longer resolves. :-(</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Luckily the link is far enough down on the list that people haven't noticed, mostly. In fact if Sergey hadn't mentioned it to me I wouldn't have noticed (not being a paid Wikipedia fact checker does cut into the amount of time I could really spend on such a project!).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I am sure it will all work itself out, and someone will update the link shortly to point to <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=AD6158D7-DDBA-416A-9109-07607425A815&amp;displaylang=en">the correct link</A>. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And then also, just as hopefully (and so that no one takes this as a pure Wikipedia bashing blog post!), Microsoft won't move the link next time they do an update. :-)</FONT></P>

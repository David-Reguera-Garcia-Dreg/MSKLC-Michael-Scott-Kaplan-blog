<h1>Evil in the middle?</h1>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>This last Thursday I was reading Mark Liberman's <A href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003300.html">Diagnosing soup label syntax</A> (and the <A href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003302.html">Saturday follow-up post</A>) on Language Log, and I admit it was cool to know that there was a bucket in which to place these phrases like <STRONG>soup that eats like a meal</STRONG> which do not really fit into either the active or the passive buckets.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But at the same time, I have been haunted by many years (from school to article writing to book writing and most recently to doc writing) where in each case the teacher/editor/writer has explained how the passive voice is weak an must be avoided -- that it was something best thought of as evil, and avoided.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So I wonder whether the middle voice is also&nbsp;a problem in these contexts?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It is really&nbsp;too late to go back and ask&nbsp;J. Todd&nbsp;King about this. And I probably wouldn't ask Mrs schultz or Mr. Fields. And it is too late to ask most of those formed editors. I could ask one of the doc writers but they are focused on technical documentation and I am not sure that the <STRONG>procedure that runs like the wind</STRONG> is the way that they would expect one to talk about a function's performance considerations (we're not trying to write poetry here -- it is supposed to be technical).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But the question remains -- is the middle voice evil,&nbsp;in the same contexts that&nbsp;its cousin the passive voice is?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And if so, is it evil for the same reasons? Or does it have reasons of its own?</FONT></P>

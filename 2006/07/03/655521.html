<h1>More misuse of the locale/language of the OS</h1>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Back in the end of May, Dare posted some thoughts about the language of search in his post <A href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=5225b67a-c942-4fa7-8f69-ca045a33ccce">Our Multi-Lingual World and Search Indexes</A>. It seems that he and the Windows Desktop Search folks have both come to the conclusion that they "<STRONG>...should consider simply choosing the indexer based on the locale/language of the Operating System.</STRONG>"</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>We'll ignore for a minute how this is a very non-specific setting that will almost never be correct since the meaningful possble choices for a user are the user locale and the user UI language -- neither of which are based on an OS level setting.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Let's focus on the fact that this is hugely ignoring&nbsp;scenarios that are&nbsp;becoming more and more common --&nbsp;such as those&nbsp;behind using the Windows Multilingual User Interface on a server to support&nbsp;many individual users, or the bigger and bigger number of multilingual users (evident even in the small sample of the nine comments to Dare's post!).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I am forced to wonder whether the solutions that Google and Live appear to be using involving the building of huge multilingual interfaces&nbsp;and perhaps&nbsp;throwing away the cases where no meaningful content is found are such a bad idea. I mean, it is obviously a brute force approach, but as long as <A href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003310.html">computers seem to keep failing in MT</A> then it is obvious that they can also fail in language guessing scenarios that are not brute force operations.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And I definitely would like to&nbsp;see fewer people relying on the locale/language of the OS....</FONT></P>

<hr/><p><strong>Ruben</strong> on 3 Jul 2006 8:02 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">I think the problem Dare touched upon is quite wide spread. There's so much 'multi-lingual' or 'locale-sensitive' software around that feels so much like software designed by, say, English speakers that think they know how non-English speakers work. (I.e., like themselves.) Invariably, that's not how it works though. Which is a pain.<br><br>I think an extended visit to mainland Europe should clear that up. &nbsp;(Large parts of Europe are somewhat bi-ligual as far as computing is concerned. Except France that is; the French do try to be as mono-ligual as possible.)<br><br>And a visit to South-East Asia should clear up all those preconceptions about how 'alphabets' work.</div>
<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 4 Jul 2006 1:56 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Hi Ruben,<br><br>I will go a step further than that, because in my opinion a lot of the so called &quot;solutions&quot; are inadequate even for the English speakers who have multilignual data....</div>

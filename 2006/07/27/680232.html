<h1>When will we support Rongo-Rongo?</h1>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>A few years back, John McConnell gave a day 2 keynote at the 26th Internationalization an Unicode Conference, entitled <A href="http://www.unicode.org/iuc/iuc26/abstracts.html#a102">The Windows Language Roadmap or When Do We Get Rongo-Rongo?</A>. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The subtitle, in a bold tradition that was subsequently taken up by this very blog you are now reading, had little to do with the actual presentation, but provided an interesting title and a fun story that cannot be found in the slides (leaving people who did not attend the talk wondering what it was all about, just as with the moose at the end of the presentation!). </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>(He did give a slightly longer version of the talk at the <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/training/presentations/multimedia/gddc2004_devTrack.mspx#E2IAC">2004 Global Development and Deployment Conference</A>, where the advantage of a video version of the presentation online exists&nbsp;for your enjoyment. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Anyway, for your reading pleasure I will (with John's permission) provide the transcript of the story below, but it is right at the beginning of the video&nbsp;and definitely worth listening to in John's unique storytelling style if you have the time (since I did not include a laughtrack it's the only way you can find out where the crowd was amused!).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>enjoy!</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>I've had several people ask me about the title of this talk "<STRONG>When do we get to Rongo-Rongo?</STRONG>". Some people thought I made up the name. I'll explain, it has a little bit of a personal history.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>One of the very first projects I had when I was still a developer involved in globalization was back in the mid-80s. It was for a very large customer whose name I can't mention, but they're in Langley, Virginia.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>The assignment I had was to support bidirectional text; technically the documents supported left-to-right, it did&nbsp;not support bidirectional. So I understood and worked with people who understood bidirectional text and I was able to work that out.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>But being the ambitious little nerd that I was, I went off to a library and I decided I would find out more about writing systems. Because I knew vaguely that East Asian text was written vertically and I thought, 'well maybe I should generalize my code so I can support vertical writing.'</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>So the library was a wonderful resource. I found out about ancient Greek writing, which (I'll probably say this wrong) Boustrophedon, where they would&nbsp;write one line going one way and then the next line would start there and go back. And that was very appealing to me.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>But then even better was Rongo-Rongo, which it sounds like it's made up by teenagers or something, but it was&nbsp;a language used on Easter Island, or I shouldn't say language,&nbsp;a writing system on Easter Island. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>I believe there's only like 120, some small number of samples. They are on these large round disks. It has never been fully deciphered.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>But the thing that was really wonderful about it is it's written sort of like Boustrophedon, but when you get to the second line, rather than just going backwards, it actually turns upside down.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>So this really put me into a fever, writing the code.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>So, unfortunately in that particular coding assignment I ultimately concluded that I couldn't support Rongo-Rongo -- the performace hit was just a little too great.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>And so, when I delivered the software to the salespeople they said "What languages does it support?" and I said "It'll support anything except Rongo-Rongo."</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>I said this as sort of a joke, but about a month later we had the version&nbsp;two requirements, which said that "<STRONG>Version two must support Rongo-Rongo.</STRONG>"</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>So ever since that experience it's been the goal at the end of the rainbow, it's where we will eventually get to before I retire....</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The full presentation talks about <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/01/26/360685.html"><STRONG>ELKs</STRONG></A> and <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/02/10/370460.html"><STRONG>LIPs</STRONG></A> and lots off the other things I talk about here, and is worth a listen, in my opinion. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So here is a quick and dirty Q&amp;A:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><STRONG>Q</STRONG>: What company was John working for back in mid 80's?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><STRONG>A</STRONG>: He was working for <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation">DEC</A> at the time, though the contract was for that&nbsp;customer in Langley, Virginia.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><STRONG>Q</STRONG>: Does&nbsp;Unicode support <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rongorongo">Rongo-Rongo</A>?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><STRONG>A</STRONG>: Rongo-Rongo is not yet encoded in Unicode.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><STRONG>Q</STRONG>: Does Vista support it?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><STRONG>A</STRONG>: The first step that Windows requires when it comes to language support is support within Unicode (after that we can get into fonts and shaping engines and such), so given the answer to the first question, the answer to this one would also be no.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><STRONG>Q</STRONG>: Will&nbsp;Microsoft ever support Rongo-Rongo?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><STRONG>A</STRONG>: It is worth noting that John has not retired yet, so who knows what the future holds? It is still at the end of the rainbow....</FONT></P>

The text is written in the ancient Aea-Colchian (the modern Mingrelian and Lazian languages), on Cretan dialect of the one. The Disc is the oldest European documented literature, a verse of a hymn to the Palasgo-Colchian Aia-Sun and Chthonian (Colchian: “Aiabzha-Neshkari”/”Nerchi”) “Magna Mater deorum Idaea” (”Dea Dia”), Great Mother Goddess Nana/Cybele (Colchian: “Nana” _ mother; Phrygian: Matar Kubileya).<br><br>Colchis was “Coli” people’s (or Gargians, Margians, the modern Mingrelian) family-country, what was unite of races of the present day western Georgia (Caucasus). It was in the ancient geography district of Asia Minor, at the eastern extremity of the Black Sea, bounded on the north by the Caucasus mountains where was chained Prometheus by Zeus, centred about the fertile valley of the Phasis River (the modern Rion). The civilizations of ancient Colchis came to bloom in the Caucasian world. In the end of the 2nd millennium BC and first centuries of the 1st millennium BC (the Late Bronze Age) was the oldest Georgian Kingdom of Kolkheti, where the Golden Fleece was sought by Jason and the Argonauts, in the 6th century BC _ 7th century AD Georgian Kingdom Egrisi known to the ancient Greeks and Romans as Lazica. The capital of Colchis was the city Aia (or Cytaea; Colchian: Kutaia; Georgian: Kutaisi; or Greek: Archaeopolis, Colchian: Jikha-goji; Geogian: Tsikhe-goji, now Nokalakevi, the village of Senaki region in Mingrelia, Georgia). Colchian language were spoken by the pre-Olympic Titans, the Sun-god Helios and the daughter of the Oceanus Perseis’ son and daughters: King Aeetes (Colchian: “Aiathi” means “Aia-Sun family”) of the Aea-Colchis and Thessallia (in the ancient Greece), Queen Pasiphae (Colchian: “Bzhaiphe” means “she who shines for all”), the wife of king Minos of Crete, and goddess Circe of the mythical island of Aiaia. Ayetes was the father of Medea (Colchian: “Madiaia”).<br><br>If you have more questions, please contact us by E-mail: giakvashilava@yahoo.com<br> <br>Best regards,<br>Mathematician Gia D.

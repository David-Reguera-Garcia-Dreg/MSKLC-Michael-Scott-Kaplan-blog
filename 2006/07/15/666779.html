<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It hearkens back to that <STRONG><A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/05/16/599204.html">Persian? Or Farsi?</A></STRONG> post I did back in May of this year, and indeed some very similar issues about it exist. The question is whether the name of the language is <STRONG>Uighur</STRONG> or <STRONG>Uyghur</STRONG>....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The simplest answer (were I and all my readers to actually be the simplest people) would be to go to <A href="http://googlefight.com/index.php?lang=en_GB&amp;word1=Uighur&amp;word2=Uyghur">GoogleFight.com</A> and discover that the web thinks of it as Uighur by a 3.3 to 1 margin. But we&nbsp;aren't the simplest people, or at least we try not to be. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>A slightly less simple answer is that of course it is not -- the name of the language is actually <STRONG><FONT face="Microsoft Sans Serif">ئۇيغۇر</FONT></STRONG>, so that arguing about the English transliteration of it makes about as much sense as arguing about the best way to spell the transliteration of&nbsp;<A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channukah#Alternative_spellings_based_on_transliterating_Hebrew_letters"><STRONG>חנכה</STRONG></A> or <STRONG><A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kadafi#Spelling">معمر القذافي‎</A></STRONG>. In other words, it does not make very much sense....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Of course, one could also be really pedantic and claim that since the use of the Arabic script for the language is a relatively recent development, that even the transliteration is a translation of the original. As Omniglot <A href="http://www.omniglot.com/writing/uyghur.htm">point out</A>:</FONT></P><FONT face=Tahoma>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face=Garamond>Uyghur was originally written with the </FONT><FONT face=Garamond>Orkhon</FONT><FONT face=Garamond> alphabet, a runiform script derived from or inspired by the Sogdian script, which was ultimately derived from the </FONT><FONT face=Garamond>Aramaic</FONT><FONT face=Garamond> script. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Garamond>From the the 16th century until the early 20th century, Uyghur was written with a version of the Arabic alphabet known as 'Chagatai'. During the 20th century a number of versions of the Latin and Cyrillic alphabets were adopted to write Uyghur in different Uyghur-speaking regions. However the Latin alphabet was unpopular and in 1987 the Arabic script was reinstated as the official script for Uyghur in China.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE></FONT>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But such arguments are ultimately unconvincing, because in truth we do not really make up language name spellings by using such pure standards. The argument of needing the Aramaic spelling to get the "real" name becomes a clear case of reductio ad absurdum, and an argument we can discard.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>As I pointed out in the later <STRONG><A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/05/23/604843.html">Persian? Or Farsi? Redux</A></STRONG> post, the argument there&nbsp;is really a transliteration for&nbsp;<STRONG>فارسی</STRONG> vs. a usage of a much older word for the language, in a much older civilization -- a bit like the argument of using the original Aramaic above! And while&nbsp;using "Farsi"&nbsp;for "Persian" may be&nbsp;like calling Spanish "Español" in English, anyone who watches <A href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0235917/">Dora the Explorer</A> (even I have a niece, you know!) may find <EM>that</EM> more and more common to be doing anyway. So the whole "connotation preference" argument seems much more reasonable and honest -- and the decision can be based on which connotation is generally preferred.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So&nbsp;what about Uighur and Uyghur? Neither of them holds much in the way of an obvious connotation preference, at least in English, right? And neither really has a common form used in English words -- this language, which is pronounced in English much like "wee-girl" without the L at the end, is not something that one can easily gleen&nbsp;from either spelling, and both look somewhat un-natural given how uncommon the forms are in English. You could make the official spelling in English Weegir and make folks in spelling bees that much happier. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Of course it seems pretty common to keep words out of spelling bees that one could make a resonable case for causing an international incident over the way that the officials expect the word to be spelled, so we are spared that whole issue, in any case.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Now&nbsp;if you look at the language and its&nbsp;Turkic roots (or maybe more accurately branches), the Uyghur/Uygur spelling is more satisfying in Turkish, from the standpoint of both orthography and phonology (not to mention avoiding the violation of <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel_harmony#Turkish">Turkish vowel harmony</A> that Uighur/Uigur would be guilty of). Of course this too is not really an argument for the English spelling of the language, either.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It does appear that the government in China prefers the Uyghur spelling in&nbsp;many of its communications, which if it were consistent and broad based would probably be more convincing, at least in terms of a "Letting the largest person in the room settle the argument that was not all that important anyway" kind of resolution. But it seems inconistently applied there too, plus more often than not it is just <STRONG>维吾尔语</STRONG> there, anyway.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So is there one that is better? I guess I can see it both ways, and really have a hard time claiming it is the most pressing issue related to the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China. Like many others, I am inclined to lack the energy to&nbsp;fight about which is better to use.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Vista, in the current builds I am looking at, uses Uighur, which if nothing else has the benefit of connection with the three letter ISO 639 code (<STRONG>uig</STRONG>) even though the two-letter code (<STRONG>ug</STRONG>) can obviously go either way. I suspect that this is the sort of thing that could easily change a bit between versions or not based on the passionate feelings of customers about the LOCALE_SENGLANGUAGE, just as Farsi/Persian has managed to do.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Or people might create custom locales to fix what the reasonably see as our mistakes, as I pointed out in <STRONG><A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/01/04/508595.html">Determining (and correcting) locale settings</A></STRONG>.</FONT></P>
<P><EM><FONT face=Tahoma>(Note: a</FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>fter I wrote all the above, I found a Wikipedia talk page that covers <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Uyghur#Uighur_vs_Uyghur">the very same issue</A>, though it too has trouble coming to conclusions on the best spelling to choose -- if nothing else the article let me correct one point I had wrong in my initial text!)</FONT></EM></P>

My collaborators and I consulted a large collection of books in and about the language, and the use of Uyghur vs Uighur (plus a couple of other, rarer romanisations) seemed very inconsistent. In one case, even the same author used different conventions in different books.<br><br>In the end, we settled on Uighur, simply on the grounds that it was more common than Uyghur, although I agree that the latter makes better Turcological sence.</div>

<p><a id="733205" href="#733205">#</a> <strong>John</strong> on Thursday, August 31, 2006 5:11 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Hi everybody,<br><br>There were a long discussion about Uyghur vs. Uighur issue at the Uyghur Language Discussion Group <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/UyghurLanguage/message/112">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/UyghurLanguage/message/112</a> <br><br>where there are many non-Uyghur linguists and Uyghurologists. The following post has finally convinced more than 90% of the members of that group.<br><br>=============================<br>I haven't weighed in to date on the Uighur versus Uyghur issue, partially since I've considered it a question of fairly minor importance, and partially since I have no strong preference myself either way. Since the question doesn't seem to have died down, however, I've thought about it a bit and have decided to send along my own proverbial two cents' worth, in the hopes that I won't make any permanent enemies thereby. <br><br>Although normally somewhat of a traditionalist and thus fairly sympathetic to Michael's position, I also find the spelling &quot;Uighur&quot; to be particularly unattractive, and even un-English, regardless of its historical pedigree, and believe as well that the &quot;Uyghur&quot; rendering is in fact supplanting it fairly rapidly in common usage among scholars and linguists working in the field. No matter how well-established &quot;Uighur&quot; may be in certain writing on the <br>Central Asian area, it seems to me that it has not really penetrated the active or passive vocabulary of most well-read native speakers of English, unless they be specialists on the area. <br><br>Looking at recent publications on the language per se, I see that Reinhard Hahn entitled his book &quot;Spoken Uyghur&quot;, while Michael Friedrich entitled his (in German) &quot;Uyghurisch&quot;. Henry Schwarz also used &quot;Uyghur&quot; for his dictionary. The relevant sections in the compendium &quot;The Turkic Languages&quot; (again written by Hahn) uses &quot;Uyghur&quot;, while Anne Lee's translation of the Hamit Tomur grammar is entitled &quot;Modern Uyghur Grammar&quot;. Indiana University's Center for Languages of the Central Asian Region uses &quot;Uyghur&quot;, Radio Free Asia uses &quot;Uyghur&quot;, the Uyghur Dictionary Projects uses &quot;Uyghur&quot;, etc. There thus seems to be a trend in the recent Western writing on the language and people itself toward &quot;Uyghur&quot;, although the traditional spelling of &quot;Uighur&quot; obviously continues to be widely used as well. <br><br>Given that most of the Turkic languages and peoples are not that well known to most English speakers, it strikes me as only natural that, at least in some cases, there may be in time a trend away from the more traditional spellings to ones that more closely resemble their actual native pronunciations. This is especially the case when sovereign states weigh in to have the English versions of their names changed. &quot;Tartar&quot; gave way some time ago to &quot;Tatar&quot;, &quot;Turkoman/Turcoman&quot; has largely given way to &quot;Turkmen&quot;, &quot;Kirghiz&quot; to &quot;Kyrgyz&quot; (no matter how strange the latter looks to English speakers), etc. &quot;Sinkiang&quot; is, I believe, the traditional spelling for the geographical region inhabited by the Uyghurs/Uighurs, but given the <br>ascendancy of Pinyin these days, I suspect that few of us are still using that earlier spelling, and that it will eventually take on the <br>patina and associations of an earlier age, just as &quot;Hindoo&quot; does for &quot;Hindu&quot;, or &quot;Mahometan&quot; for &quot;Muslim&quot;. <br><br>If I'm not mistaken, the Chinese government also prefers the &quot;Uyghur&quot; spelling, which regardless of the tradition in English will also, I suspect, eventually lead officials and others in the wider world to adhere to that spelling over time. So although Michael is indeed correct, in my view, in saying that &quot;Uighur&quot; has an established place in English, it strikes me that this place is considerably less safe than it would be if the word were commonly used in English, which it is manifestly not. Given this situation, I believe that alternative renderings by interested writers, whether English-speakers or not, will likely impact the matter, and that &quot;Uyghur&quot; thus may well continue to compete with, and perhaps eventually win out over, &quot;Uighur&quot;. Traditionalists may not like it, and it may indeed introduce some confusion (such as, for instance, in searching for one <br>version or the other in databases and not coming up with documents using the other version, etc.), but it does seem to me that, judged on recent writing, there is a trend in the direction of &quot;Uyghur&quot; that may be irreversible. <br><br>Conclusion: It is better to use &quot;Uyghur&quot;.</div>

Arabic Script: mainly in China; &nbsp;Cyrillic script: in CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) or ex-Soviet Union; Latin Script: a new born commonly accepted agreement/standard called &quot;ULY&quot; (Uyghur Latin Script) &nbsp;since 2001, mainly used in Xinjiang and among the Uyghurs in exile. <br><br>The Unicode.org website <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.unicode.org/onlinedat/languages-scripts.html">http://www.unicode.org/onlinedat/languages-scripts.html</a> stats all but does not give script IDs. Azerbaijani and Uzbek are also written in three scripts and each scrip has an individual RFC 3066 Script Variants. &nbsp;Ex: &nbsp;az-latn, az-arab, az-cyrl, uz-latn, uz-arab, uz-cyrl. I think some Linux (ex: Mandriva) support this kind of scripts code, but not ug-latn, ug-arab, ug-cyrl. I have no idea wether these names are also supported in Common Locale Data Repository of Unicode.org . I have no idea about Microsoft because they are far behind or careless, there isn't even an Uyghur locale or keyboard in Win98/Win2000/XP. This may hurt Michael very badly :)<br><br>You can find Uyghur, Uighur and Uigur everywhre. What most people cite the following sites as the main reason their fantasy does not become a reality.

It seems like people are careless (may be tolerant or respectful) and don't even bother ask linguists or read more about this language.This is very messy and confusing indeed when it comes to select one between Uyghur and Uighur... <br><br>I think GoogleFight.com idea is cool but not a good solution to this problem because there are many &quot;garbage&quot; articles on the web and google (born in 1998) crawls only the web pages and not entire publications. Since the question is still alive, I would suggest consulting linguists &nbsp;(particularly) and/or the Xinjiang/Chinese government.<br><br>Vincent</div>

Personally, I would accept even if 'ئۇيغۇر' is spelt &quot;abcedf&quot; if English speakers use ONE SPELLING only. Just like &quot;维吾尔&quot; &nbsp;in Chinese for example. What bothers me (apparently many non-Uyghurs including native English speakers) is the various spellings like &quot;Uighur Uigur, Uiguir, Uighuir, Uighur, Uygur, Uyghur&quot; and even &quot;Weiwuer&quot;... But what would you do when we really need to select one?</div>

I really appreciate that! :)<br><br>What I found strange and confusing is that in some cases Microsoft creates the LOCALE_SABBREVLANGNAME by taking the two-letter language abbreviation from the ISO Standard 639, and some other cases by chopping off the last letter of the ISO three-letter-code. I am trying to find out if there is a reason why not &quot;UG&quot;. As I know, it is not taken/used by another language, it it?<br><br>Waris</div>

Since there are no other locales that have Uighur as a primary language, the needs for a locale like English where lots of different three letter codes with the same two letter code are needed....</div>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>A quick nod to Alex Papadimoulis for his <A href="http://thedailywtf.com/">Daily WTF</A> post <STRONG><A href="http://thedailywtf.com/forums/thread/81275.aspx">Long Distance DATE$ing</A></STRONG>. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>There is very little that I could add to this gem, other than to say that most people never realized that the syntax would even work (they assume Date$ is a function or something). This is lucky for us or we might have a much more widespread problem....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And I was once doing a job for a company that had this very bug in a complex application that was a pretty awful nightmare (their use of Date$ was actually the <EM>least</EM> of their concerns!).</FONT></P>

<hr/><p><strong>Ben Cooke</strong> on 13 Jul 2006 1:51 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">What exactly *is* DATE$ from a syntactic point of view? I'm a bit fuzzy on VB syntax, but I thought things shaped like that were either string variables or functions that return strings; you can't assign to the latter, and you can't (as far as I'm aware) make &quot;magic&quot; variables that run code when you assign to them. Or can you?<br><br>BASIC has always struck me as being a little crazy, but this DATE$ thing outdoes all of the other &quot;Huh?&quot; incidents I've had.<br></div>
<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 13 Jul 2006 9:23 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Well, Date$ is actually a property off of the VBA.DateTime module, and it has both a Get and a Let off of it -- so you can retrieve the current date and you can set it.<br><br>So, in a property call you can do anything you like, even if it is not a good idea. :-)<br><br>No argument on the crazy factor here....</div>

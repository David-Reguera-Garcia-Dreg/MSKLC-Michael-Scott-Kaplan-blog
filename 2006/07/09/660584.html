<P><FONT face=Tahoma>This weekend, I have been in Cleveland, where my family was celebrating the 90th birthday of my grandmother. Last night a bunch of us went to <A href="http://www.flemingssteakhouse.com/">Fleming's</A> and had a meal that would have put Ruth's Chris Steak House to shame (had they not already shamed themselves here by closing their Cleveland restaurant just recently!)....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I think about being alive 90 years and I am awed -- Woodrow Wilson was president, we had not even gotten into the Great War yet. Really, this gives that whole sense of time passing to be hugging someone you love who has lived that long.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Earlier in the day we were watching the LPGA's <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSBC_Women%27s_World_Match_Play_Championship">HSBC Women's World Match Play Championship</A>'s quaterfinals, seeing <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juli_Inkster">Juli Inkster</A> beat <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annika_Sorenstam">Annika Sörenstam</A> after 18 holes of match play on an 18th hole where both of them had amazing drives and it was Juli's birdie that won.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I admit I was rooting for Annika; whether it was because she was Swedish and had an <STRONG>ö</STRONG> in her name or whether she was born just 12 days after me, it is hard to say. It was nice seeing the <STRONG>ö</STRONG>&nbsp;was supported in whatever program they were using for text on the screen showing the scores -- perhaps it was that support that had me interested?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But Juli played an excellent game, and I believe she would have won had it been stroke play rather than match play too (when it is not it always feels to me like one of those cases where a US president wins the election even though they lost the popular vote?). No idea why I'm talking about this match so much since there were three other matches going on at the same time (and <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Wie">Michelle Wie</A> was forced to go wie, wie, wie all the way home after losing to <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittany_Lincicome">Brittany Lincicome</A>&nbsp;-- who just graduated from high school two years ago). But for some reason the Inkster/Sörenstam match held the most interest for me. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I will never try to analyze why golf holds my interest when it does (since the rest of the time it's like watching cars rust), I'll just savor it when it happens...</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Anyway, I'm off to get some food now. I'll post again tomorrow once I am back in Redmond. :-)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Well, as the Windows 98 page says <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/support/endofsupport.mspx">officially</A>:</FONT></P><FONT face=Tahoma>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face=Garamond>July 11, 2006 will bring a close to Extended Support for Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, and Windows Me as part of the Microsoft Lifecycle Policy. Microsoft will retire public and technical support, including security updates, by this date.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Garamond>Existing support documents and content, however, will continue to be available through the </FONT><A href="http://support.microsoft.com/gp/hublist"><FONT face=Garamond>Microsoft Support Product Solution Center Web site</FONT></A><FONT face=Garamond>. This Web site will continue to host a wealth of previous How-to, Troubleshooting, and Configuration content for anyone who may need self-service.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Garamond>Microsoft is retiring support for these products because they are outdated and can expose customers to security risks. We recommend that customers who are still running Windows 98 or Windows Me upgrade to a newer, more secure Microsoft operating system, such as </FONT><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/default.mspx"><FONT face=Garamond>Windows XP</FONT></A><FONT face=Garamond>, as soon as possible.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE></FONT>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It does leave the interesting question about support for the <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/handson/dev/mslu_announce.mspx">Microsoft Layer for Unicode on Windows 95, 98, and Me Systems</A> (MSLU). Since it only ever runs on Win9x, which is no longer supported, can UnicoWS.dll be supported?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Well, to decide that, let's see what "support" means in this context.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>We have not had any security bugs reported in years, and even periodic updates were not happening much any more. So the situation&nbsp;in those areas&nbsp;would unchanged.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The MSLU newsgroup (<A href="http://www.microsoft.com/communities/newsgroups/list/en-us/default.aspx?dg=microsoft.public.platformsdk.mslayerforunicode&amp;cat=en_us_9ef46042-35e5-4b33-99f8-007ae803aa3d&amp;lang=en&amp;cr=us">microsoft.public.platformsdk.mslayerforunicode</A>) has not had much traffic, but it will probably still be around (and I still watch there).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Any time someone&nbsp;worked with&nbsp;<A href="http://support.microsoft.com/">Product Support Services</A> with an MSLU question in the past, it usually found its way to me at some point. So even if you couldn't go through PSS, you could still come here or go to the newsgroup....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And certainly if someone asks a question about MSLU here in the Suggestion Box, I'd try to answer it. Especially if were an interesting question!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So, I guess you could say that MSLU is as supported as it has been&nbsp;for the last few years, with whatever meager level you can ascribe to my efforts.... :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

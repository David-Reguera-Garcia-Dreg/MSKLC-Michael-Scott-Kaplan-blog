<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face=Garamond>This isn't much of a suggestion but more of a question: <BR><BR>I have a program that layouts glyphs from fonts to display on the screen. This all works great until I try to print, because some printers will substitute the font being used and print garbage. Is there a way to avoid the font substitution when using glyphs instead of characters or a better alternative? <BR><BR>Francisco </FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It is hard to specifically answer the question without knowing what program is being used, but I can talk about the feature, and that may help. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The option in&nbsp;the user interface goes under different names, but is usually under the Advanced options of the Print dialog and has some name related to TrueType&nbsp;fonts. It is hard to get more specific than that since it is UI that is provided by the printer driver, but here are some examples:</FONT></P>

<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/fontdlg4.jpg"></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It is interesting of course that only two options are given in most cases, since the option is based on the <STRONG>dmTTOption member</STRONG> of the <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/gdi/prntspol_8nle.asp">DEVMODE data structure</A>. It is documented as follows:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Specifies how TrueType fonts should be printed. This member can be one of the following values. 
<TABLE border=1>
<TBODY>
<TR vAlign=top>
<TH align=left width="32%">Value</TH>
<TH align=left width="68%">Meaning</TH></TR>
<TR vAlign=top>
<TD width="32%">DMTT_BITMAP</TD>
<TD width="68%">Prints TrueType fonts as graphics. This is the default action for dot-matrix printers.</TD></TR>
<TR vAlign=top>
<TD width="32%">DMTT_DOWNLOAD</TD>
<TD width="68%">Downloads TrueType fonts as soft fonts. This is the default action for Hewlett-Packard printers that use Printer Control Language (PCL).</TD></TR>
<TR vAlign=top>
<TD width="32%">DMTT_DOWNLOAD_OUTLINE</TD>
<TD width="68%"><B>Window 95/98/Me, Windows NT 4.0 and later:</B> Downloads TrueType fonts as outline soft fonts.</TD></TR>
<TR vAlign=top>
<TD width="32%">DMTT_SUBDEV</TD>
<TD width="68%">Substitutes device fonts for TrueType fonts. This is the default action for PostScript printers.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The thing is that this whole structure in general and this member specifically are trying to cover all of the possible available options in a wide variety of different printers, so for a given printer they will not all be available, usually.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But that DMTT_BITMAP member is equivalent to the <STRONG>Print TrueType as Graphics</STRONG> option, which keeps those device fonts from being used when the printer thinks it might know better.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Now in many situations those device fonts are considered to be very important, but in many international and multilingual text scenarios they are not so good -- since they are usually either not available for the font you need or the device font is a subset of the font on the computer. So printing TrueType as graphics is usually the best option....</FONT></P>

<P>Some of you who are regular readers (an odd term, since I tend to consider anyone who reads this blog with any kind of consistency to actually be somewhat <STRONG>ir</STRONG>regular!) may recall how I have talked about the latent hatred that some people have in relation to the CAPS LOCK key in the following posts: </P>

<P>Well, as you can imagine, the tempers of folks who can actually express strong emotions like hatred for a key on the keyboard&nbsp;are such that they will keep find ways to pop up, as Björn&nbsp;and ReallyEvilCanine&nbsp;did in the comment thread of the unrelated post <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/10/05/792859.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/10/05/792859.html"><STRONG>Why Michael's cool keyboard doesn't work</STRONG></A>.</P>
<P>I figured should clarify things a bit. I will stick to the facts, and try to state them in a way that even the most diehard CAPS LOCK key hater can probably agree with: </P>
<UL>
<LI>The CAPS LOCK key exists on almost every regular&nbsp;keyboard and typewriter, and has done so for at least the last 50 years;</LI>
<LI>In most scripts/languages that have uppercase and lowercase distinctions, keyboard layouts tend to use the CAPS LOCK key as a way to shift between the two states that last longer than the SHIFT key does;</LI>
<LI>In some&nbsp;keyboard layouts, the CAPSLOCK key has slightly different functionality that is supported&nbsp;by <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/tools/msklc.mspx" mce_href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/tools/msklc.mspx">MSKLC</A>, such as <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/01/25/360240.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/01/25/360240.html"><STRONG>SHIFT LOCK support</STRONG></A> and <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/01/16/513088.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/01/16/513088.html"><STRONG>SGCAPS support</STRONG></A>;</LI>
<LI><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/tools/msklc.mspx" mce_href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/tools/msklc.mspx">MSKLC</A>&nbsp;has complete and overridable support <EM>on a per-key, per-shift state&nbsp;basis</EM> to decide whether the CAPS LOCK&nbsp;is equivalent to the SHIFT key being pressed, and therefore can actually be used to render the CAPS LOCK key harmless on all keys;</LI>
<LI><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/tools/msklc.mspx" mce_href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/tools/msklc.mspx">MSKLC</A>&nbsp;automatically adds the attribute that causes the CAPS LOCK&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;equivalent to the SHIFT key being pressed any time the shifted and unshifted keys are in fact case pairs;</LI>
<LI><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/tools/msklc.mspx" mce_href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/tools/msklc.mspx">MSKLC</A>&nbsp;has complete support <EM>on a per-key basis</EM> to allow definition of SGCAPS functionality;</LI>
<LI><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/tools/msklc.mspx" mce_href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/tools/msklc.mspx">MSKLC</A>&nbsp;has complete support <EM>on a per keyboard layout basis</EM> as to whether the ShiftLock feature will be enabled;</LI>
<LI>Some people hate the CAPS LOCK key, so much that <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/10/05/792859.html#796879" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/10/05/792859.html#796879">they</A> might say things like "<EM>I just rip the damned thing off every keyboard I own</EM>" and more to the point, some of them mean it;</LI>
<LI><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/tools/msklc.mspx" mce_href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/tools/msklc.mspx">MSKLC</A> does not support any cross-layout equivalent to this functionality of disabling the CAPS LOCK key always, nor would it really be within its mandate since</LI>
<OL>
<LI>It is really not an&nbsp;internationalization feature, an <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/tools/msklc.mspx" mce_href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/tools/msklc.mspx">MSKLC</A>&nbsp;was developed by a team focused on internationalization;</LI>
<LI>Such a feature would negatively impact&nbsp;a few of the existing and some of the user-defined&nbsp;keyboard layouts in an irrevocable way and as such it would be inappropriate for <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/tools/msklc.mspx" mce_href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/tools/msklc.mspx">MSKLC</A>&nbsp;to do&nbsp;perform a global step on any machine, or to provide an install that would do so.</LI></OL>
<LI>How to add such a functionality has been brought up by people who read this blog <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/10/05/792859.html#796879" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/10/05/792859.html#796879"><STRONG>several</STRONG></A> <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/09/21/472386.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/09/21/472386.html"><STRONG>times</STRONG></A>&nbsp;in the past. :-)</LI></UL>
<P>Hopefully this post will serve as something definitive enough that everyone (including those who think of this key as the CRAPS LOCK or CRAP LOCK key) will understand what MSKLC can and cannot do.</P>
<P>And also what they can and cannot do.... :-)</P>

<p><a id="808467" href="#808467">#</a> <strong>charless</strong> on 9 Oct 2006 12:43 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">The reason that I accidently hit the CAPS key when I did not mean to is because my pinky was looking for the CTRL key. I do not object to CAPS being on my keyboard, I just started typing on computer keyboards when that key was CTRL. On my first computer CAPS was not an issue as the Apple ][ did not do lower case. The //e put the CAPS key in an out of the way place (on the lower right I think). The PC/XT keyboard also had CAPS in an out of the way place on the lower right. All of these keyboards had CTRL next to the A key on the home row. Typical software of the day also suggested the use of the CTRL key. (Anyone remember Wordstar and/or Turbo Pascal?)<br/><br/>Even today with Windows I use the CTRL key way more than CAPS and my typical layout does not have a CAPS key. (Both Left CTRL and CAPS send the scan code for left CTRL into the keyboard input)<br/><br/>So my question is this. On Vista does the registry key: [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard Layout]<br/>"Scancode Map" still work? My assumption has been that this is below the keyboard layout DLL. Is this true? Will this 'trick' still work in Vista?</div>

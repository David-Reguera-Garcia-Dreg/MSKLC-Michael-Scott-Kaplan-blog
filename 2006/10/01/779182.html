<P>When I read Larry Osterman's blog post <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/larryosterman/archive/2006/09/29/777022.aspx">*bilities</A> from Friday, I could not help but be reminded of two other posts from people. </P>
<P>One was from Eric Lippert, entitled <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/archive/0001/01/01/53298.aspx">How many Microsoft employees does it take to change a lightbulb?</A>, which I remembered from way back when it was just an email response to someone who wanted their feature added to the scripting engines. </P>
<P>The other was that post from minimsft I talked about in <STRONG><A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/06/23/431849.html">Not so small as to be internationally stupid</A></STRONG>, which was a great example of mini deciding that having all of the "overhead" of these extra kinds of checks somehow made Microsoft worse. Hmmmm...&nbsp;that whole&nbsp;idea of fewer markets, less money, less satisfaction internationally -- it really seems unappealing to me, just as it did back then.</P>
<P>It seems like the model that Jim Fawcette was pushing <STRONG><A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/07/28/681641.html">years ago</A></STRONG> when he was doubtful about my attempts to make him think of international markets as a bit more core than he did.</P>
<P>But when I think about the <STRONG>*bilities</STRONG> post that Larry did, I feel a lot more connected to it than the others;&nbsp;it is hard for me not to feel pretty personally tied up with the <STRONG>*bilities</STRONG>. </P>
<P>You see, I end up on a lot of emails where people are doing their due diligence in investigating several of the more internationally focused&nbsp;<STRONG>*bilities</STRONG> and asking what I think, under the theory that I'll know the answer if it has anything to do with international stuff.</P>
<P>Maybe they knew of me, more likely they did a <FONT color=#808080><STRIKE>Google</STRIKE></FONT>Live search and hit a page of the blog. Whatever. :-)</P>
<P>When its something&nbsp;I don't&nbsp;know myself, I usually know who to ask, so it all works out okay....</P>
<P>It's funny to think that internal&nbsp;people at MS will so often&nbsp;make the same assumptions that <STRONG><A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/07/17/667809.html">external people&nbsp;sometimes do</A></STRONG> about&nbsp;my role, but neither greater visibility nor&nbsp;widened scope of influence can really hurt a career, right? :-)</P>
<P>So let's keep up with dem *bilities!</P>

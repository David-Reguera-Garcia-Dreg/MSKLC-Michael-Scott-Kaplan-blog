<P>This is not actually a topic sugestion, but a request. <BR><BR>How about in Vista you (MS) get it right and set the time Format for Argentina to the 24 Hs format? <BR><BR>MS got it right in Windows 95, and wrong ever since. We do not use the AM/PM standard, we use the 24 Hs standard. <BR><BR>No one at MS Argentina ever told you guys at Redmond?<BR><BR>Nice blog, by the way.<BR><BR>Carlos&nbsp;</P></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P mce_keep="true">This is definitely one of those cases where "<STRONG>right</STRONG>" is a four letter word. :-)</P>
<P mce_keep="true">Even in XP this is one of the potential options for the time format:</P>

<P mce_keep="true">It is just not the default one. This does not change in Vista:</P>

They can even use the <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/02/21/535813.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/02/21/535813.html">Locale Builder</A></STRONG> to make the construction easier!

<P mce_keep="true">For future versions beyond Vista, we can always re-visit the best defaults for such situations. But until then it is quite easy for anyone who is in the group that wants different settings to actually make those different settings happen on a system-wide basis.</P>

I guess with Vista screenshots are going to grow even larger in filesize, or just look terrible.</div>
<p><strong>Nick Lamb</strong> on 10 Oct 2006 5:59 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">The screenshots look terrible because they're JPEGs, and JPEG is a lossy encoding for photographic images, not screenshots. So it makes sense to use JPEG in your digital camera, but not in your screenshot utility.<br/><br/>As to the fuzziness, yes, it's intentionally unreadably fuzzy.</div>

<p>Yeah, it's called &quot;ClearType&quot; which is quite ironic sometimes...</p>

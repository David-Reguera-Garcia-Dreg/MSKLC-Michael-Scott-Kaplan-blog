<p>I'm guessing there's some seriously screwed-up uses of local vs. UTC and some mistaken additions of local bias to times that were already local, and subtractions of local bias to times that were already UTC. Also, probably some times that are displayed as UTC when they should be displayed using the time zone that the server is in. Using the time zone of the website visitor is probably something that falls into the 'too hard' bucket (I don't think there's any part of a web browser's request which tells you what time zone they're in).</p>

We can't even coordinate time properly among our computer systems (and if sites said what local time they thought they were reporting, UTC or otherwise we'd have a chance).   Then there are character-set encodings, lordy, lordy ...<br/><br/>The original post is being presented to me as posted at 2006-10-09T08:01, although I am on your local time, so I don't know if that is a help or a hindrance.<br/><br/>Just as Google tends to break on Thursdays, Community Server tends to break on Mondays.

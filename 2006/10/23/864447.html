<P>which talks about how yesterday was International Caps Lock Day.</P>
<P>&nbsp;I know I have many fans of the CAPS LOCK key (as well as many who would like to take a flamethrower to it!) so I figure better late than never....</P>

<p>Michael, please stop blogging so much, and consolidate things into fewer posts. &nbsp;It's driving me nuts trying to keep up with you via RSS. &nbsp;You do like 200 blog posts per day and you're killing my productivity.</p></div>

<p>I have never even cracked 80 in a month, let alone 200 a day! :-)</p>

Maybe I can increase my chances to get at least some answer about my MSKLC-related question, even if the place is a bit inappropriate - but my question is at least related to CapsLock (and the MSKLC) and you missed that day some years ago!! I want to map a keyboard layout with SCGAP and AltGr and the following states:</p>
<p>1.) Key =&gt; Letter 1</p>
<p>2.) Key + Shift =&gt; Letter 2</p>
<p>3.) Key + AltGr =&gt; Letter 3</p>
<p>4.) Key + Shift + Alt Gr =&gt; Letter 4</p>
<p>Caps/SGCaps</p>
<p>5.) Caps + Key =&gt; Letter 2 (normal behaviour)</p>
<p>6.) Caps + Key =&gt; VERY SPECIAL LETTER 5 (SGCaps behaviour)</p>
<p>7.) Caps + AltGr =&gt; Letter 4 (normal behaviour)</p>
<p>8.) Caps + Shift + AltGr =&gt; Letter 3 (normal behaviour)</p>
<p>Everything works fine, except for 7. and 8. â€“ it is displayed as I want it in the GUI, but when the keyboard layout is built it won&#39;t work. Is this by design or can I do anything about it? (I tried to change the .klc manually, but it didn&#39;t work so far). I wonder if you&#39;ll even see my comment ;x</p>

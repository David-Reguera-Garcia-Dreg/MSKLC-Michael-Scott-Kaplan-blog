I'd like to perform a best-fit mapping of non-ASCII characters (for a legacy system) but both Encoding.ASCII and Encoding.GetEncoding(20127) simply turn non-ASCII characters into ???????. The following code does what I want, but it uses reflection to access the internal CodePageEncoding type:</p>
<p>String s = &quot;...&quot;;</p>
<p>Type t = Type.GetType(&quot;System.Text.CodePageEncoding&quot;, true);</p>
<p>Encoding e = (Encoding) Activator.CreateInstance(t, new Object[] { 20127 });</p>
<p>s = Encoding.Default.GetString(e.GetBytes(s));</p></div>

For whatever reason it seems to be coming from the user's selected font in Internet Options. I'm running IE7 final on Windows XP (7.0.5730.11). I noticed this because my default font is Georgia, and the shape of the glyph is particularly jarring with surrounding text in Arial or Verdana.</P>
<P>I'd have put this on Connect but the IE7 feedback site is still closed (presumably until Vista RTMs).</P>
<P>Another annoyance is that IE7's installer seems to reset the fonts selected in this dialog back to the defaults - Times New Roman and (spit) Courier New. There's a reason that Lucida Console is the default in Notepad these days (in Windows XP).</P></div>

<p>How are applications running on localized Vista supposed to show filepath names to the user with localized folder names?</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>At least in German Vista Ultimate and Home, a dir in command prompt shows:</p>
<p>C:\Program Files</p>
<p>C:\Users</p>
<p>C:\Windows</p>
<p>(not showing hidden or system items).</p>
<p>Windows Explorer shows:</p>
<p>C &gt; Benutzer</p>
<p>C &gt; Programme</p>
<p>C &gt; Windows</p>
<p>If UI shows a confirmation message with a path name say to some user application data file using:</p>
<p>SHGetFolderPath ( CSIDL_MYPICTURES )</p>
<p>this function returns:</p>
<p>C:\Users\admin\Pictures</p>
<p>(I had hoped this would return the localized name, then all legacy code would show localized UI strings on Vista without more effort... and couldn't the hidden 'junctions' folders actually make the path a valid one? &nbsp;well a digression, it doesn't seem to work that way...)</p>
<p>Is this purpose of SHGetLocalizedName(), to convert a path such as returned by SHGetFolderPath to something the user would understand browsing with Windows Explorer?</p>
<p>C:\Betnutzer\admin\Bilder</p>
<p>I've tried using SHGetLocalizedName on the result of SHGetFolderPath but get an error (GetLastError returns 'Invalid window handle')</p>
<p>Is it worth trying to figure this out, because this is the solution to my question, or is another approach (different API function better)?</p>
<p>I would expect this would confuse average users, who don't use the command line, to see English folder names coming from their Vista applications, while Explorer shows localized names for directories.</p>
<p>However I noticed that German WordPad and Paint show the English names of directories in the MRU list in German Vista, which doesn't match my expectation for consistent folder names.</p>
<p>thanks for your insight on this.</p></div>

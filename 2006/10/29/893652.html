<P><EM>I have been using MKLC for some time now and I have a question about it.&nbsp;<BR><BR>It has been at times hard to explain to my users how to use the keyboards after running setup. <BR><BR>Is there a way to make that automatic? The steps in the help file are a bit much for some of them.<BR><BR>MKLC is great though. Thanks for it!<BR><BR>Keith</EM></P></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Excellent question, Keith. </P>
<P>There is no way to do this automatically at the moment, though it has been a feature that has been requested from several different users and one we are considering for the next version. Because despite the exciting features in Windows that support multiple users logging in and such, the most common scenario is still the one person who would be installing the keyboard also being the one person who plans to use it. Given that simple fact, it makes a lot of sense to just put the keyboard in the user's Language Bar....</P>
<P>I'll keep people posted on the next release as soon as there is something to say about. A handy, small list of important features seems to be making itself known right now (and yes, 64-bit support is one of the items on that list!).</P>
<P>On a side note, I always wonder what makes some people turn <A class="" href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/tools/msklc.mspx" mce_href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/tools/msklc.mspx">Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator</A> to MKLC rather than MSKLC, even though all of the documentation from Microsoft points to the latter and not the former. Is it a "purity of acronyms" kind of thing? :-)</P>

<p><strong>Carlos</strong> on 29 Oct 2006 11:57 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>I don't know why some people like to use MKLC instead of MSKLC, but there is some precedent in other MSTLAs (actually, in this case it's MSFLAs). &nbsp;The one that comes to mind immediately is MDAC, which could just as easily be MSDAC but isn't.</p>
<p>Maybe there's some people have a general aversion to acronyms over four letters. &nbsp;Since many of the MSFLAs are built by adding either 'M' or 'MS' to a TLA, those people would always prefer 'M' to keep it at four or less.</p></div>

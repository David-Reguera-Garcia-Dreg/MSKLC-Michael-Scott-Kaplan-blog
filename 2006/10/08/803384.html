<P>No, this post is not about politics. :-) </P>
<P>It all happened in the late morning, yesterday. Robert Howard of Telligent had pointed out the <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tags/" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tags/">Tags</A> page&nbsp;on <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tags/" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tags/">blogs.msdn.com</A>, and I took a look at it (even broke my rule about clicking in links in random email!).</P>
<P>There are a whole bunch of tags there, from <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tags/Int_2700_l+Programming/default.aspx" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tags/Int_2700_l+Programming/default.aspx">Int'l Programming</A> to <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tags/Keyboards/default.aspx" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tags/Keyboards/default.aspx">Keyboards</A> to <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tags/Linguistic/default.aspx" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tags/Linguistic/default.aspx">Linguistic</A> to <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tags/Collation_2F00_Casing/default.aspx" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tags/Collation_2F00_Casing/default.aspx">Collation/Casing</A> to&nbsp;<A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tags/Locales_2F00_Cultures/default.aspx" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tags/Locales_2F00_Cultures/default.aspx">Locales/Cultures</A> to <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tags/Unicode_2F00_standards/default.aspx" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tags/Unicode_2F00_standards/default.aspx">Unicode/Standards</A> and&nbsp;maybe others&nbsp;that are there pretty much because of me (and clicking on them pretty much hits posts from&nbsp;this blog).</P>
<P>So I have been stuffing the Tag ballot box a bit, I guess.</P>
<P>Makes me wonder if I should be renaming Int'l Programming to International Programming -- especially since it seems to have top billing? :-)</P>
<P>Kind of weird when I think about it -- I looked at the total number of posts here in the blog&nbsp;as of yesterday (1354) and then saw that 574 of them had that <STRONG>Int'l Programming</STRONG> tag. In case there are bloggers here looking for hints on how to get a tag in big letters on that <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tags/" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tags/">Tags</A> page. All you need is over 500 posts that hit a particular topic with a unique name, and you can have it up in big letters, too.</P>
<P>Maybe I should rename it to <STRONG>Room for Rent</STRONG> or&nbsp;<STRONG>This Space Left Intentionally Blank</STRONG> or <STRONG>Aren't Tags Silly?</STRONG>&nbsp;just to see one of those in big bold letters.... now that would be funny!</P>
<P>The use of&nbsp;the <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tags/" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tags/">Tags</A>&nbsp;sort of page seems limited -- it is a great demo but I'm not sure what it actually delivers, if you know what I mean. Given how many other topics exist, I think the page would be better to lower whatever the entry bar is (number of posts?) to get on it so it can be a bigger page with a wider variety of tags. along with a nice random option to jump to a random topic?</P>
<P>On this&nbsp;blog I have CSS'ed the whole Tag Cloud out of existence; it just annoyed me too much. Now it is just a simple list, like it always was before. Tag Clouds are for big areas with lots of posts by lots of people. At least that's how I see it.</P>
<HR>

<P>In&nbsp;news related only in the sense of both being related to meta-blogging at <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap">SIAO</A>, I do like <A href="http://ideas.live.com/programpage.aspx?versionid=4372c8c2-b76f-4d44-aea1-9835b61d8dc1" mce_href="http://ideas.live.com/programpage.aspx?versionid=4372c8c2-b76f-4d44-aea1-9835b61d8dc1">Windows Live Writer</A>&nbsp;and have written several posts with it over the last few days, though the fact that posting in advance and marking the date ahead&nbsp;does not work with&nbsp;my blog&nbsp;(it posts immediately even with the most recent build&nbsp;145, despite claims that&nbsp;the feature works now)&nbsp;means I can't really use it all the time. Perhaps they will fix that eventually....</P>
<HR>

<P>On a totally unrelated note: I overheard on the Chris Matthews Show (I think it was NYT's&nbsp;Maureen Dowd who said it?) that a recent poll said that 75% of democrats polled think that Hillary Clinton should run, but only 55% think she would&nbsp;win (insert self-deprecating democratic laugh here). I think maybe someone should explain to the 20% of semi-retarded, self-destructive democrats that they do not&nbsp;need to have <STRONG>Born To Lose</STRONG> tattoo'ed on their hands, even virtually? :-)</P></FONT>
<hr/><p><strong>Nawak</strong> on 8 Oct 2006 7:17 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Maybe these 20% think they will lose whatever happens, but still think Hillary is their best candidate... That could be called pessimistic realism? (I don't know anything about the US politics so I don't know if it is realistic to be sure to lose for the democrats... but it certainly is for other candidates that still present themselves... Maybe 0% of their supporters think they would win, but does that make them "retards"?)<br/><br/>Oh and what happened to the promise "No, this post is not about politics. :-)" ? :)</div>
<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 8 Oct 2006 7:26 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Well, it isn't about stuffing ballot boxes, at least. :-)</p>
<p>In the US these days, the other side of the argument believes in enough things that are different that if you don't back someone you think can win, at least a mild degree of a) apathy, b) ignorance, or c) retardation has to be involved....</p>

<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 8 Oct 2006 3:45 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Ah, but that is not the same as someone who claims to be a democrat, now is it?</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Nicholas Allen</strong> on 8 Oct 2006 6:50 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>The tags page does some quite, well, useless. &nbsp;Most of the tags that are not totally unspecific are due to a single prolific blogger. &nbsp;Besides all of your categories, I'm the only one that still tags things Indigo, there's not a lot of General IE Information besides the IEBlog, and tags like Gretchen's Posts and Virtual PC Guy's Computer Game Screen Shots are not known for their broad usage scenarios.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 8 Oct 2006 7:46 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><P>Ah, perhaps two improvement are needed:</P>
<OL>
<LI>The minimal number of posts to have some representation should be lowered (Telligent's job).</LI>
<LI>The actual tag names should be made a bit more dictinctive or interesting so as to inspire exploration (the job of the bloggers).</LI></OL>
<P>If all of those happened, perhaps it would be a more useful/fun resource? :-)</P></div>

<P>I swear when I saw Raymond's post <A class="" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/10/19/844008.aspx" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/10/19/844008.aspx">No good deed goes unpunished, part 2</A> earlier today I almost ruined a keyboard since I had a mouthful of Limonata at the time. I get the same problem a bit, though not nearly as much as he does (he answers a lot more mail to DLs than I do, even only counting mails we are both on, so there is probably as correlation).</P>
<P>I will admit I even got such a response from Raymond once about 5-6 years ago when I was asking about a really obscure Win95 issue while working on <A class="" href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/handson/dev/mslu_announce.mspx" mce_href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/handson/dev/mslu_announce.mspx">MSLU</A> and was actually thinking I didn't think anybody else would be interested. I actually still have that reply archived somewhere, because after that response I learned two valuable lessons, only one of which was applicable to <A class="" href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/handson/dev/mslu_announce.mspx" mce_href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/handson/dev/mslu_announce.mspx">MSLU</A>, and both of which I still remember to this day. :-)</P>
<P>There was one <A class="" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/10/19/844008.aspx#844373" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/10/19/844008.aspx#844373">comment</A> from foxyshadis:</P>

<P><FONT face="times new roman,times" size=2>I guess it's a good thing blog comments don't have an option to send only to the poster, and not the blog.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>that reminded me that I actually still have that contact link at the top of this blog which eventually will get you to a way to send mail to me and not the blog.</P>
<P>I actually get more suggestions for posts there than I do in the Suggestion Box, which makes me think that I should actually remove that link and keep things "on the list" as it were.</P>
<P>The other thing I see a lot of, similar to but less provocative than&nbsp;Wang-Lo's <A class="" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/10/19/844008.aspx#844568" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/10/19/844008.aspx#844568">observation</A>&nbsp;(obviously more common in a newsgroup than an email DL), is people who end their initial mail to the DL with "<EM>Please email answers to me directly as I am not yet on this alias.</EM>"</P>
<P>When I see this, I truly wonder how long those people have been at Microsoft, where:</P>
<OL>
<LI>People never trim text in the reply (hell, they often won't trim the huge bitmaps!)</LI>
<LI>People always hit "REPLY ALL" which means the sender will be there</LI>
<LI>Even if #2 were not true and they hit "REPLY", there is no need to request what Outlook already does</LI>
<LI>The TO: line never gets smaller, do no one is going to take your name off unless they are complaining&nbsp;about&nbsp;you to someone&nbsp;in which case they would probably hit FORWARD and you wouldn't be on the mail even with your warning</LI></OL>
<P>But it is funny that people actually took the time to <STRONG>specifically hit REPLY rather than REPLY ALL</STRONG> yet did not recognize that it was their own volitional act that led to the circumstance of the DL being removed. I am usually not the sort of person to think that not getting a joke should be brought up during a person's review, but in this case, not getting a joke and then reporting a bug rather than asking what was meant might be a place I'd make an exception....</P></FONT>

(When sending mail, check out &quot;Message Options&quot; and the &quot;Have Replies Sent To&quot; option...)</p></div>

<p>Plus I'd hate to rely on anyone knowing about advanced and/or obscure Outlook features. :-)</p>

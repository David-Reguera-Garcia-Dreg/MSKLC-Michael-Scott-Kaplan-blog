<P>The question that came in was deceptively simple: </P><FONT size=2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Dear Sir,<BR><BR>I am in Cambodia. I need Daunpenh and Moolbaran fonts for Khmer Locale. Could you please send me that font to me?<BR><BR>Best regard,</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P></FONT>&nbsp;The answer is that I can't send out the fonts, they are a part of Vista (and I believe Office 2007), and the way to get them is to get the OS and/or product that they come with. I really can't violate the licensing agreement that is on the fonts, which would (if bought on their own from a font foundry) would (and did) cost a lot more than a copy of Windows -- in some cases more than 1,000 copies of Windows. Given that fact and the fact that hundreds of megabytes of other language support is also in that folder, they really do come at a pretty reasonable price (just like <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/04/12/407456.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/04/12/407456.html">the proofing tools</A></STRONG>).</P>
<P>&nbsp;Sorry about that. :-(</P>

<p>Seriously, none of those are actually free since Microsoft pays developers to work on those components. That is why people here in Europe get upset over bundling.</p></div>

<p>Any mature adult who does not want to just slam MS for the sport can understand this if they are willing to. Otherwise, they are just looking for a reason to call Microsoft evil so they can think of this as keeping them from having to work as hard to find things to hate. :-)</p>

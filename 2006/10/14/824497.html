<font size="3"> <p><font face="Tahoma">Back in the beginning of August when I was talking about how </font><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/08/05/689506.html"><strong><font face="Tahoma">Google doesn't seem to get blogs</font></strong></a><font face="Tahoma">, at the end of the&nbsp;post I talked about the phrase </font></p> <blockquote> <p><font face="Tahoma" size="4">not for use on unexplained calf pain.</font></p></blockquote> <p><font face="Tahoma">I even hypothesized that the article might throw off the balance of the </font><a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;newwindow=1&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22not+for+use+on+unexplained+calf+pain%22"><font face="Tahoma">search in Google</font></a><font face="Tahoma"> a bit,&nbsp;since all of the posts have the disclaimer but that was the only post that had it in the main body as well. </font></p> <p><font face="Tahoma">As it turns out, I was completely wrong: </font></p> <p><font face="Tahoma"><img height="469" src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/GoogleCalfPain2.png" width="798"></font></p> <p><font face="Tahoma">Not only is the count higher (31,500 up from 24,100 after adding fewer than 150 posts!), but the post that has more mention of it did not get top billing. It seems to be picking the representative post at random!</font></p> <p><font face="Tahoma">In fact if I&nbsp;repeat the search to look at </font><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22not+for+use+on+unexplained+calf+pain%22&amp;num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;newwindow=1&amp;safe=off&amp;filter=0"><font face="Tahoma">the omitted results</font></a><font face="Tahoma">, it goes down to 31,200. And that post is like 30th on the list, and the search craps out at 1000, while still claiming there are 31,200 entries.</font></p> <p><font face="Tahoma">The original inspiration for the phrase came from a colleague on the Access team from about eight years ago, reinforced&nbsp;years later by an&nbsp;article in </font><a href="http://www.wakemag.org/"><font face="Tahoma">The Wake Student Magazine</font></a><font face="Tahoma"> (Wikipedia article </font><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wake_Student_Magazine"><font face="Tahoma">here</font></a><font face="Tahoma">) that Kim Mann wrote that I wish was still available because it was so damn funny. The site unfortunately seems to get updated periodically and&nbsp;older articles&nbsp;just don't always make the migration, which is a shame in my opinion. The only part of Kim's&nbsp;piece that I still have is a bit I quoted at one point for something else&nbsp;that put&nbsp;an amusing&nbsp;spin on the whole </font><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_vein_thrombosis"><font face="Tahoma">deep vein thrombosis</font></a><font face="Tahoma"> thing (mention of 'toys' removed, if you know what I mean):</font></p> <blockquote> <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">And what about this 'unexplained' business? &nbsp; If it's calf pain I've speculated about, and that I've made vague guesses as to the origin of, is that enough to explain the pain, or is that completely unacceptable? &nbsp; Someone should really write an instruction manual to....explain what unexplained calf pain really is. &nbsp; But then I guess it would be explained calf pain.</font></p></blockquote> <p><font face="Tahoma">Anyway, I think I have salted the clouds enough. Maybe this post, which includes a link to the original post&nbsp;and has&nbsp;the phrase&nbsp;in the title, will do better here and start coming up as more relevant. My efforts&nbsp;might make their search work a little bit better, since when it comes to blogs they seem to need a little bit of special help.</font></p> <p><font face="Tahoma">Google&nbsp;can send me&nbsp;royalty checks for improvements to their search efforts at their convenience. :-)</font></p> <p><font face="Tahoma">Now in any case, as my disclaimer indicates, it is inappropriate to use this blog for unexplained calf pain</font><font face="Tahoma">. As would be putting my blog on any part of your body, actually (whether printing it out first or using the monitor directly). I can think of no therapeutic value whatsoever, and I'd just as soon rather not know about it if such a thing is going on....</font></p> <p><font face="Tahoma">&nbsp;</font></p> <p><font color="#ff0080"><font face="Tahoma"><em>This post brought to you by</em> <font size="6">ï¼§</font> <em>(<a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/ff27">U+ff27</a>, a.k.a.

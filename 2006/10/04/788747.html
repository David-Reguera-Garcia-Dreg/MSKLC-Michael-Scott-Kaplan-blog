<P>It's enough to give you deja vu all over again! </P>
<P>But just like I was at the <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/03/05/544133.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/03/05/544133.html"><STRONG>29th Internationalization and Unicode Conference</STRONG></A>&nbsp;in San Francisco, I will be at the <A class="" href="http://www.unicodeconference.org/conference-at-a-glance.htm" mce_href="http://www.unicodeconference.org/conference-at-a-glance.htm">30th IUC</A> in Washington D.C. that is happening from November 15th-17th. :-)</P>
<P>The talks I will be <A class="" href="http://www.unicodeconference.org/conference-at-a-glance.htm" mce_href="http://www.unicodeconference.org/conference-at-a-glance.htm">doing</A>:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>Keyboards on Win32: Beyond the Keyboard Layout Creator </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Sorting It All Out: More Words on Collation</STRONG></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Both are talks that have grown out of a combination of&nbsp;info such as the original talks I have done on both subjects (both on my own and with <A class="" href="http://www.unicodeconference.org/advisory-committee.htm" mce_href="http://www.unicodeconference.org/advisory-committee.htm">Cathy</A><A class="" href="http://www.unicodeconference.org/review-committee.htm#Wissink" mce_href="http://www.unicodeconference.org/review-committee.htm#Wissink"> Wissink</A>),&nbsp;things that have happened on this blog, through various customer contacts, items discovered while assisting folks all over Microsoft and other companies,&nbsp;and&nbsp;after the investigation and resolution of numerous bugs. I'll even talk about what comes next (well, as much as I am allowed to say, of course!). I'll post more about the presentations as the event draws nearer.</P>
<P>(Lest people think that this is indicative of <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/07/17/667809.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/07/17/667809.html">corporate committment and whatnot</A></STRONG>, it looks like I'm doing it under my own steam -- so&nbsp;think of this as being proof of my <STRONG>personal</STRONG> commitment, instead. I'll be in D.C. for a week or so, taking a bit of vacation time interspersed with various meetings. And customer contact&nbsp;is always awesome, so if you are going to be at the conference or are in the area then definitely <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/contact.aspx" mce_href="../../../../contact.aspx">let me know</A>....</P>
<P>As the event gets closer (and while I'm there) I'll post about where I'll be for folks who are interested in saying hi and such. :-)</P>
<P>See you in D.C. next month!</P>

<p>Or are you doing it under your own steam so you can speak more freely while you are there? I might show up if that's the reason.</p></div>
<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 12 Oct 2006 3:29 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>I will always speak as freely as my employer allows, whether they are paying the bill or not. </p>
<p>I wouldn't want to speculate as to the reasons, though if they felt I would be a bad representastive they would not allow me to go. So perhaps you could read into it as far as their priorities go, but I wouldn't suggest reading into it too deeply....</p>

<P mce_keep="true">Obviously not the most positive spin one could place on things, but let's look past that for a minute and look at the actual issue. Norman is talking about the Mahjong Titans game:</P>
<P mce_keep="true"><IMG style="WIDTH: 89px; HEIGHT: 120px" height=120 src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/mahjong1.png" width=89 border=0 mce_src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/mahjong1.png"></P>
<P mce_keep="true">Let's click on it and see what happens:</P>
<P mce_keep="true"><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/mahjong2.png">&nbsp;</P>
<P mce_keep="true">&nbsp;Now Norman is right, we're not talking the actual game of Mahjong, but clearly we are using Mahjong tiles. Let's try one of them out: </P>
<P mce_keep="true"><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/mahjong3.png">&nbsp;</P>
<P mce_keep="true">Ah, now I see. This is an updated version of the Taipei game from the old Windows Entertainment Pack, with cool new visuals and the same tile faces as before. Cool, I always liked Taipei (though to be honest I always like Qix and Tetris better!). I try to avoid games when I can since they can be so distracting, but I could probably play this one once in a while....</P>
<P mce_keep="true">So now let's talk about the issue that Norman raised about this update to <A class="" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahjong_solitaire" mce_href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahjong_solitaire">Mahjong solitaire</A>.Maybe somebody needs to update that Wikipedia article to talk about the Vista port? :-)</P>
<P mce_keep="true">I wonder how we moved the game from Shanghai to Taipei with no one commenting? Ah well, I don't think Brodie was from any of these places, so perhaps that is not strictly relevant</P>
<P mce_keep="true">Now one could argue (since we are talking about Mahjong tiles here) that whether we call the game Taipei, of Shanghai,or the centuries old Chinese game "The Turtle" that writing the game such that those images were available to localization would perhaps make sense, there is of course the matter of how many versions of the game out there in the wild do not do this, no matter where they were created. And it is not like it is the actual Mahjongg game with its 28 varieties that would suggest the need to have the particular expected tiles. </P>
<P mce_keep="true">Would that be the expectation? </P>
<P mce_keep="true">Now the truth is that the choice for the text on the tiles&nbsp;is not exposed to localization (although the full names of the tiles are). And it probably would have been better to make that choice available. Given that it was not, Norman is correct (as was whoever he contacted from Microsoft Japan who said that this was by design). If a choice is not made available to localizers then whether a user expectation exists or not, the design does not allow such a change.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">But does this truly point to an overarching strategy of Microsoft localization, as Norman is hinting? Not really. Any more than my blog pointing some grand&nbsp;overarching strategy of Microsoft&nbsp;language support. In both cases, we are looking at the efforts of individuals here. At some point a higher-up person gives a lazy nod of approval, or perhaps they never even noticed. But if it is strategic then it is poor strategy since no real high-level planning by executives went into it?</P>
<P mce_keep="true">With all of that said, I think it would be very reasonable to expose this in a future version (the full tiles, not just the letters put on each one, in case there are other stylistic variants here?). Or possibly&nbsp;I am&nbsp;wrong&nbsp;the tiles <STRONG>are</STRONG> available now via some piece of the resources that I&nbsp;couldn't find in a quick look. Though if that is true then either the localizers couldn't find it either&nbsp;(oops!)&nbsp;or they chose not to change the tile faces (in which case it is not even a bug at all!).</P>

<p>Like the Mahjongg game.</p>
<p>Or like the calendar gadget, which forces one to have Sunday as first day of the week :-)</p>
<p>But since I want to make a gadget just to see how the technology works, a better calendar is going to make for an interesting project :-)</p></div>

As far as I'm aware, they don't. If I remember correctly, the Queen is labelled with a 'D' in the German set (for Dame) and the Jack a 'B' (Bube).</p>
</div>
<p><a id="840619" href="#840619">#</a> <strong>RubenP</strong> on 18 Oct 2006 6:05 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Correct, the cards' legends do not change. So instead of Dutch H (Heer) V (Vrouw) B (Boer), you get K Q J. And no French R D V either. I've always regarded such anglicisms in software as broken.</p>
<p>(French cards are really confusing when you're used to Dutch cards, with V being either Jack or Queen, depending on the language. But then again: what does one do on a holiday without playing cards?)</p>
<p>Personally, I think not localizing Solitaire/Freecell cards is even worse than not localizing Mahjongg tiles. The English-centric tiles used by Vista are used all over the world IIRC, 'cause few can read the various symbols and characters without training. The one letter legends on Mahjongg tiles have little meaning to most people, unlike the legends on playing cards.</p>

<p>It is a bug. Asking to have the software properly translated in Japanese on a Japanese system is not a feature request.</p>
<p>And this is even more ironical when you think that the real Mahjongg &nbsp; (the model for the computer game) uses Kanji.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;And moreso, that the bug is the result of some conscious design desicion that Microsoft has made (as if &quot;Microsoft&quot; is one person).&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>I agree that here Norman is wrong. S**t hapens. And in general MS does a way better job at i18n than other companies.</p>
<p>I would rather believe &quot;that one part of Microsoft didn't know what another part of Microsoft is doing&quot;</p></div>
<p><a id="842866" href="#842866">#</a> <strong>Dean Harding</strong> on 19 Oct 2006 3:24 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>&gt; It is a bug.</p>
<p>A bug is an unintentional mistake. A new feature is something that was never implemented before. Of course software should be properly translated to Japanese on a Japanese system, but that is work that actually has to be done - it's a feature of the software. If that work simply hasn't been done, then it's not a bug.</p>
<p>For example, is it a bug that the Windows calculator only works with the digits 0-9? Is it a bug that it has not been translated to allow for Arabic numbers, or Thai number, or Ethiopic numbers? No, that's simply a feature that hasn't been implemented (the fact that it probably WON'T be implemented doesn't really matter).</p>
<p>I'm kind of going around in circles here, but I think you get my point.</p>
</div>
<p><a id="843217" href="#843217">#</a> <strong>Mike Dimmick</strong> on 19 Oct 2006 5:19 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Would most Japanese playing the game not be familiar with Romaji anyway? And when all is said and done, it's a pattern-matching game - you match identical tiles, apart from the 4 season tiles and 4 flower tiles (where you can match any season with any other season and any flower with any other flower). That's probably less of an issue than the court cards, where most games using them will be using the card's value in some way.</p>
<p>I've been familiar with the 'turtle' pattern for about 15 years, from Ron Balewski's 'Mah Jongg VGA' program (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.ronsshareware.com/">http://www.ronsshareware.com/</a>). Ron's version could use your own tile graphics, and I spent quite a lot of time designing a computer-related tile set (about ten years ago). Unfortunately on my parents' upgrade to a Pentium II (I'd long left home), the timer calibration loop was too fast and it periodically would crash on startup with a divide by zero error, so I wrote a small hack that detected the crash and tried again. Then about five years ago they upgraded again to a P4 and now even the hack didn't help. So my dad scanned in their actual MahJongg tiles to get higher-resolution graphics, and wrote a version in VB6.</p>

<p>Imagine you are in some new application. You work on your document for 2-3 hours, saving once in a while. But in the end, there is no file on disk, &quot;Save&quot; did not save anything.</p>
<p>You ask tech support, and they tell you &quot;it is not a bug, because this was never implemented, is a feature request&quot; :-) And you have to pay for tech support, because it is not a bug :-)</p>
<p>For me, if you translate 98% of an application, and 2% is not translated, is a bug.</p>
<p>If you accept Unicode in 12 edit controls, and don't accept it in the 13th one, is a bug.</p>
<p>But I am not going to argue about the definition of &quot;bug&quot;. I will stop here.</p></div>

<P>If the data is not exposed to localization (in other words if the project was not designed to have all elements that could potentially be localized in fact localizable) then I would say it is an error in the ability to see the localization happen.

<LI>whether this was intentional or not (i.e. if they considered and discarded the option);</LI>

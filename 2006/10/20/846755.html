<P>Maybe someone sent mail out and I missed it. Maybe Julie sent email to people about it and I missed that too. </P>
<P>But the cool news is that there are now over one million installed copies of Windows XP Starter Edition out there, and I found it quite fascinating that Starter Edition hit that milestone earlier than all of the other Windows XP subsidiary editions like Tablet and Media Center and so on. </P>
<P>Want to hear more? Well you can hear Director Julie Bennett and Senior Director&nbsp;Mike Wickstrand talk about it with the Channel 9 folks right here in&nbsp;their Channel 9 video, which you can check out now.</P>

<P mce_keep="true">Very cool!</P>
<P mce_keep="true">One thing they did not get a chance to talk about (the interview was very quick) was the connection between Windows XP Starter Edition and the <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/02/10/370460.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/02/10/370460.html"><STRONG>Language Interface Packs</STRONG></A> that I have talked about before. In fact, Starter Edition really is as logical SKU-based extension to the whole LIP mechanism, to help bring Windows to emerging markets, and the two projects share many infrastructure&nbsp;pieces with each other (including the Enabling Language Kit work that was really done to extend language support for the underlying platform so it could support both the LIPs and Starter Edition!). The stories, some of which are mention in the video, are amazing, and make me realize how important the whole "local experiences" needs are!</P>

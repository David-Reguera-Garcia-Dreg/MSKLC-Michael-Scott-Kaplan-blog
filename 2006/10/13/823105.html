This and the fact that for centuries Danish, language of the long-time rulers, was the official language have contributed to Norwegian not having one official variant as it exists for other languages. <br><br>When Norway gained independence from Denmark in 1814 a nationalist-romantic movement hoped to create a literary standard. In the 1850s the poet and linguist Ivar Aasen developed an orthography (mostly based on the west Norwegian dialects) which was called Landsmål and which became the official written language in 1885. Landsmål was renamed to Nynorsk in 1929. <br><br>Still, Danish had become so established (especially in the urban centers such as Oslo) that people kept using their Norwegian variant of Danish, called Riksmål and renamed to Bokmål in 1929. Since the beginning of the 20th century, Bokmål - under the influence of Nynorsk - has become more "Norwegianized".<br><br>Today Nynorsk is used by 10-15% of Norwegians, i.e. by around half a million people, while the majority uses Bokmål. 92% of all publications are in Bokmål. Broadly speaking, Nynorsk is seen more in rural areas, especially in Western Norway.<br><br>A state policy to merge Nynorsk and Bokmål into one language, called "Samnorsk" (Common Norwegian), by gradual spelling reforms was started in the 1930s but finally abandoned in 2002.</p></font></blockquote> <p>On a slightly more personal note, the Nynorsk LIP release gives me a bit of hope that there is enough interest in providing 'local experiences'&nbsp;(which I have&nbsp;<a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/09/12/750155.html"><strong>talked</strong></a><strong> </strong><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/06/13/428570.html"><strong>about</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/03/01/541074.html"><strong>many</strong></a><strong> </strong><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/02/01/521864.html"><strong>times</strong></a><strong> </strong><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/10/08/478472.html"><strong>before</strong></a>) that there may finally be some interest in addressing the issue. :-)</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><font color="#ff0080"><em>This post brought to you by</em> <strong><font size="6">Ｎ</font></strong> <em>(<a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/ff2e">U+ff2e</a>, a.k.a.

<p>I'm really pleased that Norway, a country with a population of 4m people has two dialects localized.</p>
<p>England (I'm keeping this simple), on the other hand, a country with a population of over 50m, doesn't not have its one dialect localized.</p>
<p>One day... one day...</p></div>
<p><strong>Norwegian</strong> on 28 Jul 2009 7:20 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>I love it. I have used it for some time and it's a really good translation!</p>
<p>A lot of people wonder why there are two Norwegian translations when the population only is 4.83 million. The grammar is pretty much the same in both standards, but the words are different. That made it easier for them to use automatic translation (which reduces the costs a lot). This is a sample sentence in bokmål (first) and nynorsk (second) demonstrating how large the difference can be:</p>
<p>Piken melket geiten sent om aftenen på seteren.</p>
<p>Jenta mjølka geiti seint om kvelden på sætri.</p>
<p>In former times, the difference was even bigger, but still it's only the words that are different:</p>
<p>Piken melket gjeten sent om aftenen på seteren.</p>
<p>Gjenta mjølka geiti seint um kvelden på sætri.</p>
<p>(the difference is a bit bigger than colour/color :-))</p></div>
<p><strong>Gisle Forseth</strong> on 29 Jul 2009 5:37 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>The difference is indeed big, as &quot;Gjenta&quot; means &quot;repeat&quot;, not &quot;girl&quot; as &quot;Jenta&quot; is, I presume this is a typo, or is the automatic translation really that bad off?</p></div>

<P>Oren Novotny asks: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>
<P>When will Segoe UI have support for Hebrew characters? This is important because Outlook 2007 uses Segoe UI as its main font. The problem is that emails with Hebrew in the subjects and sender's name come up with ??? instead of the character -- because the glyphs are missing.<BR><BR>I don't want MUI for OL; I want it in English. I just want to be able to read the subject of Hebrew emails...<BR><BR>--Oren</P></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Well, there are actually several things going on here, and I found out several other things that I found interesting when I asked&nbsp;one of my&nbsp;colleagues (Yaron Hezroni, who is actually <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/07/05/656199.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/07/05/656199.html"><STRONG>Soren</STRONG></A>'s boss!) whose Hebew was better than mine (which is not hard, given how rusty my Hebrew is!). So this post is going to dig in and talk about a whole bunch of things....</P>
<P mce_keep="true">First there is those question marks in the subject line and in the from line. These are actually not due to the font, they are due to the store contaning the mail being in the older (pre-Unicode) format. Outlook updated the .PST format in Outlook 2003 to be able to fully support Unicode, but it requires creating a new .PST file, etc. If you are not using the new format, you'll get question marks no matter what the font is if the characters are off of the system default code page. </P>
<P mce_keep="true">The next thing that was interesting is the idea of adding Hebrew to <FONT face="Segoe UI"><STRONG>Segoe UI</STRONG></FONT>. I talked to some of my typography cohorts down the hall and they have verified my suspicion that there are no current plans to do this. Instead, if <FONT face="Segoe UI"><STRONG>Segoe UI</STRONG></FONT> is&nbsp;specified then the&nbsp;built-in Uniscribe font fallback (discussed <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/10/01/476022.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/10/01/476022.html">previously</A></STRONG>)&nbsp;will be used here to get the glyphs from another font as it is doing the rest of its complex script processing. It just so happens that the font used for the fallback is <FONT face="Microsoft Sans Serif"><STRONG>Microsoft Sans Serif</STRONG></FONT>, rather than <STRONG>Tahoma</STRONG>, for reasons about which I am not entirely clear. There are actually many people (including Yaron) who prefer <STRONG>Tahoma</STRONG> here, though <STRONG>Microsoft Sans Serif</STRONG> is not too bad of a choice there for most people, so it does not make a bad font fallback choice.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">The real question that comes up when one builds a font like <STRONG>Tahoma</STRONG>&nbsp;that actually combines so many scripts (Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, Arabic, Hebrew, and Thai) is how all of the scriprs&nbsp;work together -- how multilingual text that crosses these script boundaries will look in terms of size, baseline, visual chracteristics, and so forth. Some hard compromomises have to be made (I'll talk about some of these issues for Arabic and Thai another day, and concentrate on Hebrew today!). Hebrew does fairly well in both <STRONG>Tahoma</STRONG>&nbsp;and <STRONG>Microsoft Sans Serif</STRONG> here, so there is not too much of a problem.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">Of course the main reason someone like Oren&nbsp;might desire a <STRONG><FONT face="Segoe UI">Segoe UI</FONT></STRONG>&nbsp;that included Hebrew was to make sure that such a connection could be made; <STRONG><FONT face="Segoe UI">Segoe UI</FONT></STRONG>&nbsp;is neither <STRONG>Tahoma</STRONG>&nbsp;nor&nbsp;<STRONG>Microsoft Sans Serif</STRONG>. Because of that, Hebrew script glyphs that are designed for it are not an unreasonable ask here. And the answer is that Vista actually has a font that has (for the most part) the basic Latins from <STRONG><FONT face="Segoe UI">Segoe UI</FONT></STRONG>&nbsp;and its own Hebrew glyphs -- that font is called <STRONG><FONT face=Gisha>Gisha</FONT></STRONG>.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">Now <STRONG><FONT face=Gisha>Gisha</FONT></STRONG>&nbsp;is an interesting word in Hebrew, it basically&nbsp;represents&nbsp;what an English speaker might think of as&nbsp;the noun form of the word&nbsp;<EM>approach</EM>, like the way one might approach a person, or maybe the way a typographer might approach the issue of how to&nbsp;apply the font style of <STRONG><FONT face="Segoe UI">Segoe UI</FONT></STRONG>&nbsp;with Hebrew glyphs. :-)</P>
<P mce_keep="true">It is also an ironic name since as it turned out the folks in the Microsoft subsidiary in Israel and lots of native speakers of Hebrew did not really care for the approach taken with <STRONG><FONT face=Gisha>Gisha</FONT></STRONG>.The descriptions of why this was the case were not always entirely coherent but usually people either did not see the need for a change, or pointed to specific issues like how it seemed a bit more stark/barren, or how it was more "boxy" (like&nbsp;a Volvo of modern Hebrew script fonts?) or the way the size/baseline issues were handled,&nbsp;or how the <STRONG>ס</STRONG> (Samech) and the <STRONG>ם</STRONG> (Mem Sofit) were not as properly differentiated due to the lack of some of the&nbsp;curves seen in other fonts, and so on. So while it is still readable, it was just not the ideal approach to the generic UI or document font to use as a default for all Hebrew text when a specific font was not explicitly chosen. It's not that it was terrible, but it just wasn't the first (or second, or tenth) choice that people had.</P>
<P mce_keep="true"><EM>(the&nbsp;approach to transliteration in Unicode names&nbsp;that caused the Samech to be called Samekh probably deserves its own post!)</EM></P>
<P mce_keep="true">I'll pause to show a nice picture of a whole bunch of fonts looking at the basic&nbsp;the Hebrew consonants. This includes all of the fonts from Vista, a few from Office 12, and even a few others from the Hebrew version of Office 11 so I could show some Hebrew script fonts. </P>
<P mce_keep="true">I put the size I had to use to try to get the consonants to be about the same size (to make the comparisons easier in terms of style). Of course this hides the size issue but I figure if someone loves a font they can always jack up the size themselves, right? :-)</P>
<P mce_keep="true">If you are a native Hebrew reader/writer/speaker, you will likely have your own preferences -- for what you would want in a Torah,&nbsp;or an email, or a Word document, or an IM window, or anywhere really:</P>
<P mce_keep="true"><IMG height=1026 src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/hebrew.png" width=998>&nbsp;</P>
<P mce_keep="true">Interestingly, from a typography standpoint many folks were pleased with Gisha and praised its clean lines and the work to try to push the Segoe UI approach to the Hebrew script. Though in another perhaps ironic turn, there is no "i" as in "with" sound in Hebrew, meaning that one would have to pronounce it as in "ee"&nbsp;like in "see". The Hebrew is גישה which is also the Hebrew word used for the term <A class="" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geisha" mce_href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geisha">Geisha</A>. Now when one talks about clean lines and such in <EM>that</EM> context, a whole new and possibly HR-unfriendly&nbsp;aproach to typography is seen!</P>
<P mce_keep="true">But&nbsp;how to add multiple scripts into the mix&nbsp;remains a difficult problem (many of the above fonts do not have the Latins in them, and I did not show the ones that did in the document above), even for scripts for which the problem seems like it ought to be easier....</P>

<p>It took me a while to figure that one out as well. It's not like I can speak anything other than English, but I've had a few email exchanges with people in China and it was a bit confusing seeing email from two or three different people all of whom had the name '???'!</p>
<p>They certainly took a while, though, only going fully-Unicode in 2003!</p>

<p>One thing though is that Office 2007 does not include all of those new LH </p>
<p>fonts like Gisha, but it does include Segue UI.</p>
<p>That means that on an XP machine running Office 2007, the mappings do not </p>
<p>work and ??? shows up. &nbsp;In this particular case, there is no PST as it's </p>
<p>using an Exchange 2003 SP2 mailbox.</p>
<p>I suppose upgrading to Vista will solve the problem as the fonts will be </p>
<p>there, but for now it seems that Hebrew won't work right in Office 2007 on </p>
<p>XP. &nbsp;That's very disappointing.</p>

<P>Your store that has your Inbox has to be configured to support Unicode. That is the missing link here, and can work just fine in XP (it works for me on XP SP2 with both Outlook 2003 and Outlook 2007).</P></div>

<p>? only show up when converting to a code-page that doesn't support a character. The 'missing glyph' symbol is a box - if it was a font problem, then you'd get a box, not a question mark.</p>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>(If there was ever a use for the INTERROBANG, this post would likely be it.... </FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>I wish it would work in the title of the post!)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I am not sure where the term 'blog pimping' came from, but I guess it is time that I used it, since everyone else seems to be....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The process first started for me when I got some help in making my blog look more like I wanted it to f</FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>rom <A HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/jledgard/">Josh Ledgard</A>, as I described <A HREF="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/01/21/358585.html">here</A>.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>In other (sad) news, the better half of blogging power couple #2 (Gretchen) <A HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/jobsblog/archive/2006/04/11/573455.aspx">is leaving Microsoft</A>, and her last day is Friday. :-(</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But the reason I am posting right now is that <A HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/SaraFord">Sara Ford</A> (who as an aside now reports to <A HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/jledgard/">Josh</A>) asked Gretchen </FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Of course what was&nbsp;funny was that&nbsp;Sazra asked the question about an hour after the change went live on <A HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/jobsblog/">JobsBlog</A>!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I actually started doing it because of the problems I was having with anonymous comments <A HREF="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/02/03/524026.html">just this last February</A>, some of which have been resolved by some of which have not yet. Anyway, this last Friday Gretchen noticed and&nbsp;asked me how I did it.... so I sent her the code and a few days later she went live with it (check any recent post on <A HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/jobsblog/">JobsBlog</A>&nbsp;to see what she put right above where you enter comments!).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><EM>I'll have to ask&nbsp;Gretchen how she gets people noticing the bottom of her posts so much more quickly than they notice mine!</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So Gretchen answered Sara's question thusly:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><EM><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>It's an addition of some code in the "news" section. Michael ... I sense a blog hacking post in your future. ;-)</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>You can think of this post as a present for Sara, from Gretchen. It never would have occurred to me to write this up if she hadn't had this premonition. Or&nbsp;does it not count as a premonition if the person being psychic suggests it? :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Anyway, for the how it&nbsp;works piece, the actual pimping in this post....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Two parts to the script I added:</FONT></P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>One piece for posts where comments are closed to replace the "New comments to this post are disabled" text that Community Server generically adds, and</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>One </FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>to handle the posts that are still taking comments (where Community Server adds the generic "What do you think?" text in an H3).</FONT></LI></UL>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The script:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face="Courier New" size=1>&lt;script language=javascript type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;!--<BR>window.onload = function() {<BR>&nbsp; // Enumerate headers after document is loaded.<BR>&nbsp; var i, h3s = document.body.getElementsByTagName("h3");<BR>&nbsp; for (i = 0; i &lt; h3s.length; i++) {<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var elem = h3s.item(i);<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (elem.innerHTML == "What do you think?") {<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; elem.innerHTML = "&lt;big&gt;So what do you think about it?&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;A few words about comments:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No HTML tags are currently supported;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Comments can only be made up to 90 days after the post originally went online.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;";<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<BR><BR>&nbsp; // Enumerate italics after document is loaded.<BR>&nbsp; var k, EMs = document.body.getElementsByTagName("em");<BR>&nbsp; for (k = 0; k &lt; EMs.length; k++) {<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var words = EMs.item(k);<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (words.innerText == "New Comments to this post are disabled") {<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; words.innerHTML = "Comments are closed after 90 days. Frustrating? Perhaps. But you could maybe &lt;a href="<FONT face="Courier New">/michkap/articles/512061.asp"&gt;Suggest</FONT><FONT face="Courier New"> a Topic&lt;/a&gt;, instead?"</FONT><BR>}</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And that's it -- you can put as much or as little text as you like, or even HTML if you want to....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Enjoy!</FONT></P>

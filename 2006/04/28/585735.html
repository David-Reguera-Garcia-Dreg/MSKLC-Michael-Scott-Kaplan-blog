<h1>DEFAULT_GUI_FONT really stinks</h1>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>You don't want to ever use DEFAULT_GUI_FONT. Just like the <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/08/22/454360.html"><STRONG>thread locale</STRONG></A>, <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/04/13/407912.html"><STRONG>AVICAP32.DLL</STRONG></A>, and <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/04/23/411074.html"><STRONG>SetLocaleInfo</STRONG></A>, it really stinks.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Raymond Chen talked about some of its history of this <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/gdi/devcons_1t10.asp">GetStockObject</A> derived font last year when he answered the question <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/07/07/436435.aspx">What are SYSTEM_FONT and DEFAULT_GUI_FONT?</A></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>He even explained one of the big problems about it in international scenarios:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>"...on a typical US-English machine, they map to bitmap fonts that do not support ClearType."</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But beyond that, there is another big problem.&nbsp;The problem&nbsp;is that the actual font it resolves to is SKU dependent; it is not dependent on any of the various locale settings on the machine. It therefore becomes one of those "features" that keeps an MUI system with a changed system/user locale from being a 100% substitution for a localized system in testing.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And even in Vista, where the single world wide binary goal has really been largely achieved, the backcompat issues that come up with (for example)&nbsp;a Korean&nbsp;user who expects a particular legacy application's font settings to not change disallow 'fixing' this behavior. So we are stuck with this bit of cruft that will forever differentiate some particular language SKUs of what is otherwise a SWWB model system....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Don't forget that as Raymond talked a bit about, all of the <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/gdi/devcons_1t10.asp">GetStockObject</A>&nbsp;derived fonts are no longer what the help topic claims to be -- they are not used by the system for anything, and remain only for the sake of applications that have depended on these ugly beasts.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So please stay away from DEFAULT_GUI_FONT; it stinks, truly!</FONT></P>

<p><a id="586023" href="#586023">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on Friday, April 28, 2006 10:36 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Hi Ted,<br><br>I'm sorry, but you are mistaken -- especially on CJK machines, where DEFAULT_GUI_FONT is decidedly *not* MS Shell Dlg, and explicitly chosen by the SKU language.<br><br>This is especially bad in Vista, given the independence from SKU that has otherwise been acheived.....</div>

<p><a id="586133" href="#586133">#</a> <strong>Ted.</strong> on Friday, April 28, 2006 1:06 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">The only point I was trying to make was that this statement: &quot;...on a typical US-English machine, they map to bitmap fonts that do not support ClearType.&quot; is not true for DEFAULT_GUI_FONT. &nbsp;It is true, I concede, for SYSTEM_FONT. &nbsp; DEFAULT_GUI_FONT maps to a ClearType font on a typical US-English machine. &nbsp; &nbsp; This one statement is all that ruins such a good article. &nbsp;<br><br>Other than that, yes, your article makes some valid points. &nbsp;I do agree that DEFAULT_GUI_FONT is an unfortunate part of Windows history that we'll have to live with for a long time (as every MFC app ever built uses it for dialog box fonts on DBCS systems - see CDialogTemplate::SetSystemFont)</div>

<p><a id="586768" href="#586768">#</a> <strong>charless</strong> on Saturday, April 29, 2006 1:08 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Michael,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;Having actually worked on a consumer program that shipped as a SWWB, I have run into this issue more than once. It seems to me that making DEFAULT_GUI_FONT really return what the documentation claims would be a good thing, in most cases. As it is now, if you needed to programatically draw a window that looked like a dialog box and you used DEFAULT_GUI_FONT to do the computations to get from dialog units to screen units. You would end up not only with the font looking wrong, but the aspect ration of the dialog wrong as well. I am sure that making such a change would cause many existing apps to differently. In some cases differnt would be bad/worse than now, but I believe in some cases it would be better/more correct than it is now.<br><br> &nbsp; &nbsp;In any case I think the comments on Raymond's post show that the MSDN article for GetStockObject really needs to be updated to explain the issues and some sample code to do this the 'correct' way. If the behavior is not changed, it seems like it would be advisable to add a way to set what font returned. (at least for developers) e.g. a registry setting and a PowerToy to pick it.<br><br>-charles</div>

<p><a id="588187" href="#588187">#</a> <strong>Dean Harding</strong> on Tuesday, May 02, 2006 3:00 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">As to what to use instead of DEFAULT_GUI_FONT or MS Shell Dlg, you should be using the various fonts returned by SystemParametersInfo. Different parts of the UI can have different fonts (to illustrate, right-click on the desktop and go Properties, then change the various fonts under Appearance-&gt;Advanced).<br><br>In .NET, you should be using the SystemFonts class to get the various fonts for the different parts of the UI. (which is essentially the same thing). It's a shame that WinForms doesn't automatically set the Form's font to SystemFonts.IconTitleFont (which is usually Tahoma) but I believe there was a backcompat issue between .NET 1.1 and .NET 2 which means they can't change it...</div>

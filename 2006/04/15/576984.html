<h1>Offense can be a cultural thing</h1>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I was reading Benjamin's <A href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003020.html">brief history of 'spaz'</A> on <A href="http://www.languagelog.org/">Language Log</A>, and I think it is quite interesting how words that can be quite innocuous in one culture can be quite incendiary in another.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>In the particular example with Tiger Woods and the word <STRONG>spaz</STRONG> it is not even between languages since it is English in both cases. Perhaps we could distinguish&nbsp;different dialects in terms of whether there are such "points of passion" in one but not another?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>For myself, I know that I&nbsp;should speak about my own problems in a more polite way than I do since other take offense. But it is easier to laugh off the situation with the occasional self-deprecting <STRONG>gimp</STRONG>.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Or to&nbsp;counter my ex-fiance's glib '<STRONG>girls with glasses don't get passes</STRONG>' with a '<STRONG>man with stick can't find a chick</STRONG>' or the newer '<STRONG>man who scoots gets no beauts</STRONG>'.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Or to answer questions like 'what's your height?' with <STRONG>4"1'</STRONG>, or even better <STRONG>124cm</STRONG> (which is about what my height is when I am sitting in the scooter).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Of course its considered slightly different if you are a member of the group you are perhaps nominally insulting. It doesn't bother me obviously, but sometimes it makes others uncomfortable (especially people who feel I am working against the progress for sensitivity on the issue).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>We call it <STRONG>Political Correctness</STRONG> mostly, as if&nbsp;saying that I "have multiple sclerosis" is somehow magically better than&nbsp;saying I&nbsp;"am afflicted with multiple sclerosis". Which in my humble opinion is completely asinine; on a day that I do not leave my house for fear of being able to&nbsp;walk more than 20 feet without falling (it's rare but it has happened) calling it an affliction is probably the most polite way to adequately describe the situation.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>On the other hand, I probably might be offended if someone used such a term on a day that I was feeling just fine -- perhaps going so far as to say the only affliction I was suffering from that day was the presence of the person making the statement....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And I have had&nbsp;quite spastic moments&nbsp;before, and could easily&nbsp;keep someone up at night&nbsp;if they had to be around me and my muscle spams&nbsp;(I take Baclofen now, so I generally don't have the problem). Somehow calling myself a spaz in those situations is slightly less frowned upon by most. Even in England.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But, to get back to cultural issues, we hit the real problem -- it really shouldn't be a cultural issue so much as a situational one. It is an issue where we shouldn't use the most extreme form of the problem as the default. Better to save the exteme stuff for when you&nbsp;feel pretty afflicted by it.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>How on earth can someone know about every single possible point of offense in every single culture? It is truly impossible, unless you have every word you say pre-screened by native speakers before you say anything. Which is not always going to be possible.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I doubt we can add a LOCALE_SWORDSTHATOFFENDTHECRAPOUTOFPEOPLE flag to <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/intl/nls_34rz.asp">GetLocaleInfo</A> to solve the problem programatically, though it would be fun to collect the data!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So, if anything I post here in the blog offends someone in a particular culture, I can promise that it was not intentional (unless I specifically say otherwise!).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Or, at the very least remember that </FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>I am sometimes a <STRONG>gimp</STRONG> and/or a <STRONG>spaz</STRONG>....</FONT></P>

Then I found out that it's a sports team in New Zealand, and figured that it's not offensive to them, so I figured it shouldn't be offensive to me.<br><br>It would be nice if the OS could supply a nice list of offensive words, but then you would have trouble keeping track of the thousands of different subcultures, let alone what derogatory slang they use.</div>
<p><a id="577110" href="#577110">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 16 Apr 2006 3:03 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Hi Gabe,<br><br>I agree. The other problem I would see in the software solution for us is the ten thousand warnings the file would trigger in scanning tools trying to help avoid shipping offensive terms in software! :-)</div>
<p><a id="577588" href="#577588">#</a> <strong>Alun Jones</strong> on 17 Apr 2006 12:15 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Would it be more appropriate to refer to them as the &quot;All Really-really-dark-greys&quot;?<br>The remark refers to the colour of the New Zealand rugby team's uniform. &nbsp;Is the word &quot;Black&quot; now no longer appropriate to represent the colour?<br>I'm reminded of a story in one of the American newspapers that told me that a huge number of African-Americans had voted in South Africa's first fully-inclusive elections. &nbsp;Someone had obviously gone through and substituted &quot;African-Americans&quot; for &quot;blacks&quot; in a number of articles, and hadn't bothered to see what the effect was on the meaning of the text.<br>As for &quot;spaz&quot;, I'm wondering what the derivation could have been that doesn't have a likely offensive lineage.<br>Warnings in programs? &nbsp;Try asking MS developers about Microsoft's &quot;policheck&quot;, which prevents you from documenting a &quot;white-list&quot; versus &quot;black-list&quot; approach to spam filtering, but doesn't prevent you from naming a variable &quot;felch&quot;. &nbsp;Oh, and it also prevents you from saying, in comments, &quot;I hate having to write this code in this way.&quot;<br>Me, I eat faggots for dinner. &nbsp;They're tasty, especially when covered in gravy.</div>
<p><a id="578453" href="#578453">#</a> <strong>Dan Glick</strong> on 18 Apr 2006 2:53 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Interesting, I didn't know that about Policheck.<br><br>If I were encountering that, I'd be sorely tempted to use, e.g. 'blanc-list' and 'noir-list'.<br><br>Or are we supposed to say that in the 1950's, suspected Communist sympathizers in Hollywood were African-American-listed?</div>

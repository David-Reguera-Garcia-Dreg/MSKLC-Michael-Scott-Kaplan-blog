<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Regular readers may remember how I have complained <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2004/12/28/333168.html"><STRONG>in</STRONG></A> <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/04/21/410305.html"><STRONG>the</STRONG></A> <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/03/15/552031.html"><STRONG>past</STRONG></A> about the way Word interferes with key strokes on keyboards that are required for a given language.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I have long hoped that the folks over in Office would fix this issue. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>After all, it is a pretty easy issue, conceptually -- if a particular key stroke combination is assigned in the current keyboard layout, then perhaps it should not be overrided to do some handy intuitive shortcut to functionality in Word, right?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But I just read a but from Jensen Harris's blog such as <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jensenh/archive/2006/02/14/531801.aspx">these</A> <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jensenh/archive/2006/04/12/574930.aspx">three</A> <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jensenh/archive/2006/04/14/576384.aspx">posts</A>, and it is clear that a ton of thought has gone into all kinds of exciting new&nbsp;stuff like better documentation of shortcuts, work to support the old accelerators (though I wonder how that works in localized product!?),&nbsp;and KeyTips and such. But as far as I can tell, no one decided to fix simple problem of "get off my freaking key!" for other language keyboards.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I mean, it is all well and good to say:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P>We've also used the data from the <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jensenh/archive/2006/04/05/568947.aspx">Customer Experience Improvement Program</A> to track down the most frequently-used features without good keyboard shortcuts so that we could add them. For instance, you'll find CTRL+ALT+V added for Paste Special.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But I have wonder&nbsp;if&nbsp;sufficient data came from where &gt; 60% of the customer base comes from.&nbsp;After all, if you are using the Czech, Croatian, Serbian, Slovenian, or Hungarian&nbsp;keyboard layouts, than CTRL+ALT+V is also ALTGR+V, and that is the keystroke&nbsp;combination&nbsp;you use to get the <STRONG>@</STRONG>, a pretty important character for email addresses. So you won't even be able to send email to Microsoft to complain about this bit of keystroke hijacking. :-(</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Which is not to say that the folks using the Syriac or Divehi&nbsp;keyboard layouts (where it is U+200d, the ZERO WIDTH JOINER), are going to be much happier.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And that is just one keystroke. Reading Jensen's words about the research that went into the issue, I am sure there are others that may be just as useful to some (and just as problematic for others!).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Admittedly, it can be hard to interrogate a keyboard for all that information. But after posting almost an entire series on the issue (most recent&nbsp;post <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/04/13/575500.html"><STRONG>here</STRONG></A>), all of which is based on calling publicly available Win32 API functions,&nbsp;it is obvious that the information is out there now. And come to think about it, that it always has been out there (though perhaps not as well documented!).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So now my plea to the folks in Office -- please fix the this bug, which has&nbsp;become the&nbsp;#1 bug affecting the usability of multilingual keyboards....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><EM>(Or, <STRONG>if it has been fixed</STRONG> but no one has told anyone yet -- please get the word out!)</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Alternately, I'll probably have to finish that add-in I have been working on and off for the last few years to do the job for them at some point. Perhaps that can be a new part for the series? :-)</FONT></P>

<hr/><p><a id="578778" href="#578778">#</a> <strong>Ben Cooke</strong> on 19 Apr 2006 2:55 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">It seems to me that a simplistic solution to get them started would be to stop using Ctrl+Alt (and AltGr) for keyboard shortcuts completely. I'm sure there are keyboard layouts that use other modifier keys, but a large number of them use AltGr to get at extended characters. Putting application keyboard shortcuts on AltGr is just asking for trouble.<br><br>(Of course, they should also keep off Ctrl+Alt+Shift/AltGr+Shift, which really just leaves them with Alt and Alt+Shift. But I think that's okay since Alt's been used for shortcut keys in dialogs for yonks.)</div>

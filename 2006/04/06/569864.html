That state was actually the first Indic state to be formed along linguistic borders. Today 84.86% of the state's population speak Telugu. Four main (and several minor) dialects exist, in all of which there is a marked difference between the spoken and the literary form. Still, the difference is not as big as in the beginning of the 20th century when spoken and literary Telugu had drifted apart so much that they seemed two different languages: the modernized literary language is closer to everyday speech today. <BR><BR></FONT><B><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>Fun facts:</FONT></B><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>&nbsp; <BR>- Because all words in Telugu end with vowels, the English in 19th-century India called the language "the Italian of the East".<BR>- For the (huge) Telugu movie industry there is the term <I>Tollywood</I>.<BR><BR></FONT><B><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>Classification <BR></FONT></B><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>Telugu is the biggest of the Dravidian languages.

<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>Number of speakers:</FONT></B><FONT face=Tahoma size=2> 104 million <BR><BR></FONT><B><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>Name in the language itself:</FONT></B></FONT><FONT size=2><FONT face=Tahoma>&nbsp; ਪੰਜਾਬੀ<BR><BR></FONT></FONT><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>Punjabi is the language of the Punjab region which includes the Punjab province of Pakistan as well as the Indian states of Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh. Since 1966, it is the official language of the Indian state of Punjab, where it is spoken by most of the inhabitants. Overall it is spoken by around 28 million people in India, and it is one of the 22 official languages of the country. It is has many more speakers in the Punjab province of Pakistan, but although more than 70 million people speak it in that country, Punjabi has no official status in Pakistan. <BR><BR>Punjabi has many regional dialects which form a continuum and merge with related languages on the borders. The main dialects of Punjabi in India are Majhi, Doabi, Malwai and Powadhi, while Pothohari, Lahndi and Multani are most prominent in Pakistan. Majhi, which is spoken in the cities of Lahore and Amritsar, is considered the purest and the standard form of Punjabi in India. <BR><BR>Punjabi is also spoken as a minority language in several countries where Punjabis have emigrated, for example Great Britain, the United States, Australia and especially Canada, where it is the sixth most commonly used language.<BR><BR>With more than 100 million speakers Punjabi is ranking as 10th among the most commonly spoken languages worldwide. One feature makes Punjabi unique amongst Indo-European languages: It is a tonal language, like e.g. Chinese; there are three different tones (high, mid, low) in Punjabi which create different meanings.<BR><BR></FONT><B><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>Fun fact:</FONT></B><FONT face=Tahoma size=2> Punjabi is the language usually used in Bhangra music which has gained wide popularity in Southeast Asia, but also in Europe (The rapper/DJ Panjabi MC landed major dance hits in Europe with his songs "Mundian To Bach Ke" and "Jogi").<BR><BR></FONT><B><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>Classification <BR><BR></FONT></B><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>Punjabi - like Hindi and Gujarati - belongs to the Central Zone of the Indo-Aryan languages, which in turn are members of the Indo-European language family.<BR><BR></FONT><B><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>Script<BR><BR></FONT></B><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>In the Indian state of Punjab Punjabi is mostly written in the Gurmukhi script, while in Pakistan the Shahmukhi script is used (a modified Persian script also used for Urdu).

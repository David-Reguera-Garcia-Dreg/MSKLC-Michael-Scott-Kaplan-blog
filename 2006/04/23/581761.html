<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Assuming you are on this planet, you have probably heard about the name of Tom and Katie's new baby.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Of course I lost the faith I had in Katie (dating from Teaching Mrs. Tingle) by the time the second season of Dawson's Creek was over, and I don't think I ever had faith in Tom.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Ah well, at least he was supposedly kidding about the placenta eating bit.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Are there any non-weird actors out there?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>In any case, o<FONT face=Tahoma>ver on <A href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/">Language Log</A>, Benjamin Zimmer gives a good summary of the whole Tom Cruise/Katie Holmes baby naming announcement snafu in the post <A href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003050.html">Adventures in Celebrity Onomastics</A>.</FONT></FONT></P><FONT face=Tahoma>

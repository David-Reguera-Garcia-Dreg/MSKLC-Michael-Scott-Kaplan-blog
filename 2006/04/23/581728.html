<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Last year some time I was back in Cleveland, and I saw my first episode of <A href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460644/">Ghost Whisperer</A>. I made the offhand comment during a commercial break that Jennifer Love Hewitt in this show (with her new darker hair) looked a lot like Alyssa Milano (if you went back a hairdo or three -- both Alyssa and Rose among the Charmed coven change their hair styles and colors a lot!).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I wasn't saying they were twins or anything, just that it would be easy to confuse them at first glance....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>My father disagreed with me and suggested that I might be a little bit crazy. Or if nothing else that I did not know what actresses looked like :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Anyway, looking at the following two pictures, as a baseline example:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><A href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001349/"><IMG alt="Jennifer Love Hewitt" src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/JLH.jpg" border=0></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000192/"><IMG alt="Alyssa Milano" src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/AM.jpg" border=0></A></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It should be easy enough to see why I suggested there might be a similarity, I think.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Which is not to say that I am not crazy; but if I am it is for other stuff, not for this! :-)</FONT></P>

<p><a id="589924" href="#589924">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 4 May 2006 10:51 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Well, the clipping and resizing to make sure we were looking at similar sizes may be responsible for some of that (also the picture of AM was clearly touched up while the JLH one was not), so it is hardly a fair quality comparison....<br><br>But the fact remains that the similarity is fairly obvious. :-)</div>

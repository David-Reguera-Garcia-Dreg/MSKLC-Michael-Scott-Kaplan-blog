<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I honestly can't believe how strange the conversations I have seem to get, sometimes.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I mean, Cathy came by to grab a snickers bar from the candy dish, and she was fussing with the stuffed cows on the bookshelf. She was&nbsp;trying to figure out why they were all facing the&nbsp;books instead of out at the room. I pointed out that this is just something Shawn does while he is telling me that he is stealing something from the candy dish.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So as she was sitting there repositioning the cows to more outward facing positions I asked her not to hurt the cows (the three stuffed cows and one beanie baby cow are all I have left of the Godot project, UniCOWS!).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>She seemed shocked and offended&nbsp;that I suggested she would ever hurt them, which forced me to remind her of the "cow on wheels" incident.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>We were at <A href="http://www.crateandbarrel.com/default.aspx">Crate and Barrel</A> waiting on a dinner reservation (meeting someone else there, if memory serves), and Cathy had found one of those European toys, a 'cow on wheels', something like this one:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>

<P></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>She was pulling it around by a string that was attached, and she accidentally ran it into the wall.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Shocked, I asked her how did she think Julie would feel if she saw Cathy's little exercise in cow abuse?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>She paused, and said apologetically "you're right."</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And then she proceeded to run it into the wall repeatedly. I was certain that she'd be giving them a credit card to pay for damage to the wall (and the cow!).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Of course at this point I remembered the recent&nbsp;posts&nbsp;from over at&nbsp;Language Log <A href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003030.html">about</A> <A href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003038.html">the</A> <A href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003048.html">cow</A>, and I asked whether that cow on wheels (assuming it was still ambulatory after Cathy's exercise in bovined abuse) clouded the issue of the "cow a motor vehicle" further....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Occasionally we manage to get work done there, too. I promise.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>As I <A HREF="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/04/13/575529.html">hinted</A> at the other day, Gretchen Ledgard is no longer at Microsoft. Since I won't be able to write about her as eloquently as <A HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/korbyp/archive/2006/04/13/576233.aspx">Korby</A> did, I won't try to do that.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But I'll mention some of what I will miss now that she is <A HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/jobsblog/archive/2006/04/11/573455.aspx#577055">officially</A> no longer in the building next door....</FONT></P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Being the only person who would still call her Miss Garland (the copy of Outlook on my laptop was aiming to ask her out, I think -- it seemed to be in denial that she had married <A HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/jledgard/">Josh</A>&nbsp;and assumed her alias was ggarland!);</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Knowing that if it was a little too late to scare up lunch plans I could IM her and it would turn out she was about to grab a bite too;</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>All of the insight into HR and recruiting at Microsoft and in the real world;</FONT></LI></UL>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Ok, I'll stop now, like I said I won't be as eloquent as Korby -- but I agree with everything in that post he put up so you can just paste that post in here for the rest.... :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>A colleague just IM'ed me and mentioned that although he didn't know her, it was like the public face of Microsoft recruiting was leaving. And there may be some truth in that -- there&nbsp;is not a ton overlap between <A HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/jobsblog">JobsBlog</A> and <A HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/heatherleigh/">Heather's blog</A>, for example. Even when you look at the just the recruiting posts.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I mean, even mini-Microsoft said <A HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/jobsblog/archive/2006/04/11/573455.aspx#576774">farewell</A>. How often would you expect that sort of thing to happen?</FONT></P>
<P><EM><FONT face=Tahoma>(I know a GM who used to joke about how wanting to be RIF'ed might be a worthy carer goal; </FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>I think it&nbsp;may be&nbsp;a worthy goal for those of us who are not as important to be thought of as bad attrition when&nbsp;we leave)</FONT></EM></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Sure,&nbsp;Gretchen and I will&nbsp;see each other again, we may even have lunch again some day if she can be talked out of showing up in velour jogging outfit (don't ask, it's not a pretty story!). But it won't be the same....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So, i</FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>s the public face of Microsoft recruiting leaving? Well, one of those faces most certainly is. And if it's the one you know then it is quite the apple-cart upsetter.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Gretchen, </FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>I hope&nbsp;you will always feel&nbsp;free to&nbsp;IM me about some blog trick that&nbsp;you see here that&nbsp;you want to try out. Or if you and Josh are looking for a third wheel to go do Kamkaze shooters with.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And I wish you the best of luck -- may your real life exceed your dreams in all that you do. What does <A HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/betsya/">Betsy</A> always say again? Oh, that's right -- Live it vivid, Gretchen!</FONT></P>

<p><a id="577352" href="#577352">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 17 Apr 2006 2:06 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">RIF == Reduction In Force, a layoff or early retirement that is (reportedly? usually?) associated with a settlement package that is luractive enough to make it worthwhile to accept the RIF.<br><br>I think they have come over in mini's blog from time to time, in the comments? I only know about them antecdotally; it has been discussed from time to time like in this article:<br><br>www.forbes.com/2000/02/07/dvorak_0207.html <br><br>but I don't know of anyone who was ever actually RIF'ed.... and the Forbes article clearly puts a much more negative spin on it than I have ever heard anyone use internally....</div>

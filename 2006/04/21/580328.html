<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Unicode is a standard that fits all kinds of different needs.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Obviously the need to represent text that may contain important symbols used in science has always been important.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>At some fundamental level, the identity of that symbol goes beyond an italicized small letter 'h', and therefore</FONT><FONT face=Tahoma> the need to represent Planck's constant even in plain text&nbsp;was a real one.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Thus, it was encoded at U+210e. And has been since at least Unicode 1.1 (and I believe 1.0).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>There is a nice description of the constant itself up on <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant">Wikipedia</A>. It looks something like this:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=6>ℎ</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>For fun you can even italicize it? :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=6><EM>ℎ</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Recently, Andreas Prilop asked on the Unicode List:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>The symbol for Planck's constant (6.626E-34 J·s) is an italic "h". Why is there a special Unicode character U+210E for it?<BR><BR>The symbol for the elementary charge is an italic "e". But of course there is no special Unicode character for it.<BR><BR>The symbol for the speed of light is an italic "c". But of course there is no special Unicode character for it.<BR><BR>The symbol for the fine structure constant is an italic "alpha". But of course there is no special Unicode character for it.<BR><BR>etc. ad inf.<BR><BR>So what's this U+210E for? IMHO, this character should be listed as deprecated.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Deborah Goldsmith of Apple was first to point out the answers to these questions:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>To differentiate it for purposes of representing mathematics in plain&nbsp;text....<BR><BR>....Note that there is not a MATHEMATICAL ITALIC SMALL H&nbsp;precisely because U+210E exists.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And she is right -- if you look at the <A href="http://www.unicode.org/charts/">Unicode charts</A> at the <A href="http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1D400.pdf">Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols</A> block, there is a reserved space at U+1d455. The reason for these spaces is described in <A href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr25/">UTR#25: Unicode in Mathematics</A>&nbsp;right after Table 2.1:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>The plain letters have been unified with the existing characters in the Basic Latin and Greek blocks. There are 24 double-struck, italic, Fraktur and script characters that already exist in the Letterlike Symbols block (U+2100—U+214F). These are explicitly unified with the characters in this block and corresponding holes have been left in the mathematical alphabets.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Kind of says it all, doesn't it? :-)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma color=#ff1493><EM>This post brought to you by</EM> "ℎ" <EM>(<A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/210e">U+210e</A>, a.k.a. PLANCK CONSTANT)</EM></FONT></P>
<hr/><p><a id="580992" href="#580992">#</a> <strong>David</strong> on 21 Apr 2006 5:17 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Maybe I'm missing something, but the response didn't seem to answer the question. &nbsp;Why did the Unicode standard elect to create a PLANCK CONSTANT character instead of a MATHEMATICAL ITALIC SMALL H? &nbsp;If PLANCK CONSTANT was created before the mathematical symbols were added to Unicode, why did they create PLANCK CONSTANT without all of the other constants?<br><br>I think it's a great idea to differentiate characters representing well-known mathematical constants when they might be used with regular text, but the response doesn't seem to say why they went about it this way.</div>

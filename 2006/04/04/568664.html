<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The episode title is '<STRONG>Iced</STRONG>.'</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The scene went something like this:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><EM>{Tony DiNozzo </EM></FONT><FONT size=2><EM>is playing&nbsp;Tetris on his celullar phone}<BR></EM></FONT><FONT size=2><STRONG>Ceasar</STRONG>: So, like, you don't got no.... questions for me?<BR><STRONG>Tony</STRONG>: That's a double negative.<BR><STRONG>Ceasar</STRONG>: Huh?<BR><STRONG>Tony</STRONG>: Don't... got no... is a double negative. It's a non-standard use of two negative words in the same sentence... cancel each other out and create a positive. Actually, in Shakespeare's day the double negative was used as an emphatic, but now it's just considered a mistake. Don't know if that's what you intended. I'm pretty sure it's not. We'll just go with the whole colloquial idiomatic thing.... <BR>{refers to his Tetris game} this is hard! <BR>{back to Ceasar} I'm pretty sure you meant 'Do I have any questions?' and the answer to that question is 'I have no questions.' I do have some observations though.... Ceasar... that's an interesting name, obviously derived from Caesar. That was a powerful dude. My name is Anthony; my friends call me Tony, which backwards is Y Not. Anyway... </FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>At this point,&nbsp;Tony manages to make Ceasar lose his temper and reveal a bit more than he intended to. But it was interesting to look at him using a somewhat linguistic criticism&nbsp;technique in his interrogation.... :-)</FONT></P>

However, a double positive is ALWAYS used to reinforce a positive meaning, and there are NO dialects where a double positive has a net negative effect.<br>Student: Yeah, right.</div>

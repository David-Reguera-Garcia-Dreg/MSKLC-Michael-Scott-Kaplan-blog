<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Over on Language Log, Arnold Zwicky posted <A href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002985.html">It's all grammar, one more time</A>. And there was one bit there that I found very amusing towards the end:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>As far as I can tell, things like the conventions for composing double dactyls and knock-knock jokes don't make it into the book, but maybe that's just because she hadn't come across any inept double dactyls or ill-formed knock-knock jokes, and nobody had asked her about these forms.&nbsp; (Let's listen in...&nbsp; Grammar Hotline: "May I help you?" Caller: "Yes.&nbsp; When my brother speaks Pig Latin, he pronounces 'stop' as 'topsay', but I say it has to be 'opstay'.&nbsp; Which of us is right, Grammar Lady?")</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It reminded me of the before time, in the long long ago, before the Providers had changed the name of Longhorn to Vista....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>You see, we had just shipped Windows Server 2003 a little while ago, a product which had its name changed at the last minute from <STRONG>Windows .NET Server 2003</STRONG> (as was described <A href="http://www.winsupersite.com/faq/whistler_server.asp">here</A>) to <STRONG>Windows Server 2003</STRONG>. I never heard from any authoritative source, but some people claimed the last minute name change cost the company a ton of money since the name string was hard-coded in so many places.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So anyway, to avoid this problem in the future (the expense, not the name changes themselves; just ask anyone who worked on Office XP about those last minute name alterations in products!), some work was done to make sure the name was stored in a more central location.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And to test this, there were several early internal builds that, to test this centralization,&nbsp;had the name of the product (at the time <STRONG>Longhorn Professional</STRONG>) translated into Pig Latin, so that any place that had the name unchanged would be considered a bug.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>(as a disclaimer I will point out that none of this is a secret, really -- it was for example </FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>discussed on Paul Thurott's site in <A href="http://www.windowsitpro.com/Articles/Index.cfm?ArticleID=40354&amp;DisplayTab=Article">this article</A>)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Now to why the Language Log post made me think of it -- because the Pig Latinized version of the name was <STRONG>onghornlay rofessionalpay</STRONG>, rather than <STRONG>onghornlay ofessionalpray</STRONG>, as some might expect. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Of course that version (4029 and a few of the surrounding daily builds) are long gone, so it's all a distant memory....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It's too bad no one called in to Grammar Lady to get an official answer on the gramaticality of the fake Longhorn name. :-)</FONT></P>

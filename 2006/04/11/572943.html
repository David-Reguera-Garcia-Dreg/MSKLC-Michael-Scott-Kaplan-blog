<P><FONT face=Tahoma>A lot of the documentation for functions in the NLS API makes the point that for a length parameter you can either pass the length or you can pass -1 to signal that the string is NULL terminated.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>(I have mentioned this <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/04/20/410043.html">previously</A>.)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>As it turns out, most of the functions will treat any negative value this way, and it has been that way since the functions were first written (in many/most cases, over a decade ago).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So,&nbsp;let's look at them one at a time....</FONT></P>
<UL><FONT face=Tahoma>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>CompareString &lt;= -1</FONT> </LI>
<LI>CompareStringOrdinal == -1</FONT></LI><FONT face=Tahoma>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>FindNLSString == -1</FONT> </LI>
<LI>FoldString &lt;= -1</FONT> </LI><FONT face=Tahoma>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>GetStringTypeEx &lt;= -1</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>GetStringType[A|W] &lt;= -1</FONT> </LI>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>IsNormalizedString == -1</FONT></LI>
<LI>LCMapString &lt;= -1</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>MultiByteToWideChar &lt;= -1</FONT> </LI><FONT face=Tahoma>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>NormalizeString == -1</FONT> </LI>
<LI>WideCharToMultiByte &lt;= -1</FONT> </LI></UL>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Believe it or not, some of the comments specifically talk about the parameter being equal to -1 even though the check underneath the comment is for less than or equal to one.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Of course we can't change the behavior due to the backcompat concerns, though maybe the comments should be updated someday. Though the fact that no one has pointed it out before makes me wonder if anyone ever reads them anyway? :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>If you look at the functions, you may even see the pattern -- it is only functions added later that have the "equal to -1" behavior. So that is something, right? We are consistent, in our own way.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>In any case, it is safer to just pass -1 since some functions work that way. And it is an easier rule to remember than a big list of functions....</FONT></P>

<br>
<br>I think the whole &lt;= -1 thing probably came about because someone decided that zero and positive values would be a value, and negative values would be a code/indicator. In the initial implementation, -1 was for a NULL terminated string, and other negatives reserved for future use. 
<br>
<br>Ideally, this should be done by separate parameters, one indicating if a string is NULL terminated, another parameter for the length (if not NULL terminated). This approach is verbose, and that is both a good and a bad thing! </div>

<br>As an aside, it's odd that your comments to this post have an overescaped &amp;lt; in their subject, but ours (mine and Phylyp's) don't... must be due to the &quot;HTML&quot;-ized blog admin tools?</div>

<br>Weird... they seem to wander, and appear only intermittently. &nbsp;Right now I'm looking at a page where only my last comment has an &amp;lt;, and all of the other comments have a normal &lt;</div>

<br>Yup, I agree that multiple params are only an 'idealistic' solution, practically it's probably better to merge them, especially in scenarios like this, where -ve lengths are meaningless. 
<br>
<br>Heh, I used to wonder how people programmed Windows before IntelliSense, IntelliTips and all those keystroke savers in VS 6. 
<br>
<br>Also, no, I wasn't suggesting changing the behaviour (UK spelling, ha!) of existing functions. 
<br>
<br>I was merely pointing out the fact that one parameter is actually for two purposes: as a flag/indicator, when -ve and as a value when +ve. 
<br>
<br>On a related note: I work in data warehousing. We often have a need to store values and/or indicators pertaining to an attribute/entity. In these cases too we often encounter a similar debate about merging values and indicators in the same column. 
<br>
<br>Since its a database, and especially since its a data warehouse (where space isn't a constraint), we go for the purist approach, and have a column for the indicator, another for the value. The biggest advantage of the purist approach is that it is quite self-documenting. </div>

<br>
<br>Pushing the idea of parameter reuse a bit further, LCMapString has a parameter (lpDestStr) that is a pointer to a byte array when LCMAP_SORTKEY is passed, and a pointer to a string when LCMAP_SORTKEY is not passed.
<br>
<br>It gets a little weird when LCMAP_SORTKEY | LCMAP_BYTEREV is passed, depending on whether the number of bytes in the sort key is odd or even... see

<br>But what are the reserved parameters for in LCMapStringEx? &nbsp;Anything you can let us in on?

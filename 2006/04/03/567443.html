<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Time zones are never easy. Even when it seems like they ought to be....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The latest flap is going on now in Sri Lanka.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The official plan is succinctly described&nbsp;<A href="http://www.zeenews.com/znnew/articles.asp?aid=279608&amp;sid=SAS">here</A>:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>Sri Lanka will put back its clocks by half an hour and revert to the practise of having the same standard time as India after its 10-year experiment to save daytime failed. </FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>You have to love objectivity in journalism, don't you? :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It also ends with one interesting note:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>Sri Lanka reverting back to its old time zone would have implications for astrologers, computers, airline schedules and Microsoft whose latest windows versions give Sri Lanka standard time as 6.00 hrs ahead of GMT. </FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Interesting because the primary consequence I tend to see is a flurry of mails from different support contexts (PSS, MCS, and many others) as customers call up concerned about another time zone change....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>We deal with it all the time, and follow whatever is going on. So there really are no worries here as the updates do happen as needed.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I find myself (in my unofficial capacity as someone with very little say in any of this) </FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>agreeing with Arthur C. Clarke and <A href="http://www.zeenews.com/znnew/articles.asp?aid=281765&amp;sid=SAS">his thoughts</A> on the matter:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>British science fiction guru Arthur C Clarke today asked Sri Lanka not to change the standard time after a 10-year experiment on daylight saving and asked India to put the clock forward and join Colombo in a common time zone.</FONT></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Wouldn't it make more sense, at least a little bit?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>There is also a BBC <A href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4865972.stm">article</A> that notes one wryly amusing matter in all this:</FONT></P><FONT face=Tahoma>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><EM>The whole debate is being wryly observed by the Tamil Tiger rebels, who control large parts of the island's north and east. <BR><BR></EM></FONT><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><EM>They ignored the 1996 change, leading to two de facto time zones within the country. <BR><BR></EM></FONT><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><EM>As Sri Lankans in the south get ready for a possible adjustment of their watches, some have observed that at least there is one thing that the two sides finally agree on.</EM></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE></FONT>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Fair&nbsp;point. Though I do kind of wonder whether, if a change must happen, whether&nbsp;</FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>having everyone fall into line is better than a synchronized bit of falling out of line....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Of course the issue ends up being more complicated, since it involves politics and language and even religion (one of those articles I mentioned early points out that there are people who believe that disasters like Tsunami happened because of the original time zone change in Sri Lanka a decade ago).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I have no specific opinion on this matter other than to believe that punishment (when it exists) from either parent or deity should principally punish only the wrong-doers, and therefore it is unlikely to be the cause in this case (in my humble opinion).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>If I am wrong, look for the&nbsp;blog to be <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/03/19/554539.html">on fire</A> soon....</FONT></P>

Clarke says something about the importance of time zone stability, which I agree with. But what are the reasons for suggesting India switch too? I can't find any in the article. Since you agreed with him, maybe you can say what your reasons are?</div>

The 5.5 hr difference is just maddening. When doing quick TZ conversions, I tend to mix up the .5 calculation, and usually end up 1 hr off. <br><br>Which means I'm dialing into a call 1 hr early :) <br><br>Well, thanks to MS for their Time Zone utility - it matches my expectations exactly. <br><br>I'm curious what what the rationale for India selecting a 5.5 hr offset, instead of 5 or 6 hrs. Being close to the equator, we don't face much daylight variations, so a half-hour diff shouldn't matter.</div>
<p><a id="568073" href="#568073">#</a> <strong>Roozbeh Pournader</strong> on Tuesday, April 04, 2006 8:52 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Well, Iran also did it this (Persian) year. Two days before the daylight switch was supposed to happen, they cancelled the former rules. But guess what? The next day, the long Iranian new year holiday started, which is officially only five days, but for most of the people it's two weeks (ending this last Sunday). This resulted in many Linux and Unix servers and desktops displaying the wrong time. I could only fix FarsiWeb's servers and desktops two days after they automatically went to the abandoned daylight saving rule.<br><br>But what about Windows desktops and servers in Iran? Well, they were already on pot. For whatever reason, Windows has the Iranian daylight saving switch some time in early March instead of late March when it happens, so they had already switched their time to +0430, resulting in the caring users changing the clock back one hour manually. But that would mean that while the clock displayed fine, emails going and coming would be tagged with the wrong time. Also, when the user travelled, he couldn't just switch the timezone on his laptop and go. He needed to readjust the time.<br><br>The Microsoft data for Iranian timezone has even made me arrive one hour early in a meeting. For the story, see paragraphs two and three in this post:<br><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.advogato.org/person/roozbeh/diary.html?start=23">http://www.advogato.org/person/roozbeh/diary.html?start=23</a><br><br>Anyway, Microsoft should really consider a collaboration with the Olson database guys and use their data after that. Linux guys are using that, Apple is using that, IBM is using that, in short I believe everyone but Microsoft uses that database. Yes, it is volunteers on the Internet that maintain that database, but IETF is also officially volunteers on the Internet. Microsoft implements IETF standards, doesn't it?<br></div>

Plus it may not be geographically feasible. Many big cities are near the east-west centre of the country along the same longitude - Delhi, Hyderabad, Madras. I imagine choosing the solar time line as the time zone border would cause a huge ruckus in Calcutta, as that would be the only big city left East of the line.<br><br>China, much wider than India, manages to get away with a single time-zone, arguably because most of its population is concentrated in the East. Although the Uyghur and other minorities in Xingiang don't care much for the sun rising at 9am and setting at 10pm.<br><br>As for why Sri Lanka could choose to be in UTC+6, there's precedence:<br><br><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/teaching/timezone.html">http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/teaching/timezone.html</a></div>

Now this merger will solve these problems. Microsft Windows 98/Me/2000/XP/2003/Vista have time zones GMT+6 for Sri Lanka. I appreciate if Microsoft could release an addon that put Sri Lanka in GMT 5.5 region. Scientifically Sri Lanka is GMT 5Hours and 20 minutes (Sri Lanka is more close to &nbsp;80E from Green which).

And it is great to have the same time, especially since travel between the two countries is very popular. We must remember that very few people do international calls. The 5:30 time came as a compromise to having 5 time and 6 time. However, having just two time zones is not needed. If India were wider, then it can have time zones, but not at its actual size.</div>

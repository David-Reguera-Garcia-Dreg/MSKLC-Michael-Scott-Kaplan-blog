<h1>Time zones make me cringe</h1>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I did talk about a particular time zone issue <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/04/03/567443.html">earlier today</A>....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And I see that Anthony <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/bclteam/archive/2006/04/03/567119.aspx">posted</A> about a new sample using managed code on the BCLTeam blog.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>There is one bit there that I swear makes me cringe every time someone mentions it:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>The single most requested individual feature for the Base Class Libraries that has not been delivered yet is for support for Time Zones other than Local and UTC. This is a feature we are actively exploring for the next release of the .NET Framework.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>My cringe is in part inspired by the explanation from <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/">Raymond Chen</A> of <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/10/24/55413.aspx">Why Daylight Savings Time is non-intuitive</A>. Every time one of those .NET vs. Win32 compatibility issues raises its head I get nervous, so this one that keeps popping heads up lik a hydra can be quite cringe-inspiring.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The other part that makes me nervous is the sample itself&nbsp;-- seems like no Win9x support (the Win9x registry key is different, something the VB sample in <A href="http://i18nwithvb.com/">my book</A> took care of), and also seems like it has no support for the Vista updates that support the localized time zone name strings, though of coursed that is not yet in shipping product&nbsp;(I figure a sample could try to be either forward or backward compatible!).</FONT></P>
<P><EM><FONT face=Tahoma>As an aside -- that Vista fix with the time zone names is similar to the one done for keyboard layout names in Windows XP to get them out of the registry too; <STRONG>I'll talk more about this another day for both keyboards and time zones</STRONG>. Incidentally, that keyboard fix is one that the 1.0 and 1.1 versions of .NET did not pick up but I believe&nbsp;the issue&nbsp;was addressed in 2.0....</FONT></EM></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I should probably stop worrying so much, it's not like the sample can't be updated. And there is plenty of time for the right thing to happen in product....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But I wonder why nothing can ever be easy with time zones. :-(</FONT></P>

Seem like time anywhere other than home has always been wacky. Maybe someday when we refer to it as Stardate we will have solved that problem. I never knew of Spock and Kirk having trouble thinking about what time it was. Then again in space, what did it matter.</div>

LATER... Kirk says it is &quot;stardate 1329.1&quot;<br><br>&quot;Fall back,&quot; perhaps?<br><br>Also see: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a3_367.html">http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a3_367.html</a></div>

William Shatner was not in The Cage -- he was not in Star Trek until the second pilot. Maybe you meant Jeffrey Hunter, playing Captain Pike? :-)</div>

<p><a id="567656" href="#567656">#</a> <strong>Fil Mackay</strong> on Monday, April 03, 2006 5:54 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">How would you do this?<br><br>With the recent event in Australia (Commonwealth Games), Microsoft had to roll-out an update to amend the timezone schedule for 2006. This was a pain, since that subsequently screwed up any applications (eg. Outlook) that seem to store everything in GMT.<br><br>Would you, in this scenario, have to roll-out this patch to all Windows computers world-wide?<br><br>I think the solution for Outlook is to store the time in a timezone format (ie. time+TZ identifier). This way when the timezone moves (they do), the time moves with it. I think .NET has a good head-start on that.</div>
<p><a id="567878" href="#567878">#</a> <strong>oldnewthing</strong> on Tuesday, April 04, 2006 12:24 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">It also doesn't support the new &quot;multi-year variable DST start/end&quot; format coming in Vista (necesary for countries like Israel where the cutover date is based in part on the lunar calendar). Those registry key formats are not contractual, and Vista is going to change the rules.</div>
<p><a id="567885" href="#567885">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on Tuesday, April 04, 2006 12:32 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Indeed -- one of the core problems with any group in Microsoft that goes off to solve a problem when they don't own the actual area they are trying to solve. :-( <BR><BR>Luckily for all of us, Vista ships before whatever version of the .NET Framework would have this addition, so there may be time to force the right thing to happen....</div>

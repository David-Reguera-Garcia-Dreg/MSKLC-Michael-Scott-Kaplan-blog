But where is this Font switching functionality explained/specified? and what else does the framework (presumably its the .Net framework) give for us free. (I know about the auto resource assembly loading stuff) <BR><BR>Don't get me wrong I _like_ this functionalty - it saves me from doing it and getting it wrong ;), but where is it explained? <BR><BR>I suppose its a "given" that should be obvious to anyone who has done this before. </EM></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Regular readers might see an eerie familiarity between this and GDI font linking, as I have discussed in <A HREF="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/01/22/515864.html">many</A> <A HREF="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/10/01/476022.html">previous</A> <A HREF="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/03/08/546809.html">posts</A> <A HREF="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/06/18/430507.html">in</A> <A HREF="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/12/12/502463.html">this</A>&nbsp;blog. Of course there are limitations to this approach as well, as some of these posts have indicated.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But it does make for a quick way to get support for ideographs without having to choose a font....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It is functionality that is dependent on the system locale for the exact chain of fonts in which ideographs are located.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It is hard to answer the question about what else the .NET Framework gives for free, especially when in this case what it gives "for free" here is the same functionality that already exists in the OS and has since Windows 2000. I tend to think of features like this as more of an attempt to give parity with existing functionality....</FONT></P>

Still at least I've learnt what font linking is - or is it font substitution - doh!.<br>&lt;/moan&gt;<br><br></div>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>A few days ago, a guy named Ken asked in the Suggestion Box:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>Hi Michael, <BR><BR></FONT><FONT size=2>I been following the codepage articles and i notice that using the method you describe does not produce characters point for certain codepages. &nbsp;For example, codepage 708, 709, 710, 737, 775 (this just list a few)... doesn't return any code points. &nbsp; Why is that? &nbsp;The code page are valid code page identifiers as listed on MSDN.<BR><BR></FONT><FONT size=2>Thanks in advance. <BR>Ken </FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>One of the biggest problems with leaving anonymous suggestions is that if&nbsp;I have a question about&nbsp;it </FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>then the only thing I can do is:</FONT></P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>leave the&nbsp;suggestion there forever and never answer it;</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>delete the&nbsp;suggestion and pretend it never was left;</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>randomly start looking up people in the world with the same name in the hopes I stumble across the person;</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>post about it and ask the question there.</FONT></LI></UL>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I chose that fourth option. Ken, I hope you are reading this!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>These code pages work for me.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>However, since the exact post that was being asked about was not left (not even its title!)&nbsp;so I am not sure what specific technique or calling method (or even flags&nbsp;or the error returned or even&nbsp;version of Windows) is involved.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I definitely need more information to suggest what might be going on....</FONT></P>

The clue being the phrase &quot;doesn't return any code points&quot;, since that's the only code you've posted recently that outputs Unicode code points AFAIK.<br><br>Does that give you anything to work on Michael?</div>
<p><a id="550840" href="#550840">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 13 Mar 2006 8:07 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Hi Nick --<br><br>Well, the code in that article (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/01/20/515238.html">http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/archive/2006/01/20/515238.aspx</a>) works just fine with these code page values -- as long as the code pages have in fact been installed on the machine....</div>

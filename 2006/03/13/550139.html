<P><EM><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>Option two (sanity will prevail) may very well seem pointless.&nbsp; I mean after all these are issues where you have no control over.&nbsp; However, I am firmly convinced that if enough smart people are following this path and continue to work toward that great day it is bound to happen sooner or later.&nbsp;&nbsp; Plus, the world is a much better place with hope rather than sulking.&nbsp; So even if the full vision never happens at least you had a good time working towards it.</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

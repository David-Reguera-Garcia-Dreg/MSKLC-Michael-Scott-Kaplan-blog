<P>As soon as I saw the email I knew what the problem was (you might see the problem as well!).</P>
<P>And within five minutes of the first mail I got a second one from Leandro, who also saw what the problem was:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>Sorry, I thing I´ve found the problem. I´ve copied the VCTOOLS from your post that is C:\Program Files path in the error, but my Windows is PT-BR, so the correct folder is C:\Arquivos de Programas.<BR><BR>Sorry :-(</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>No need to be sorry, Leandro!</P>
<P>What I had been working on (and would have even finished before that second mail if Leandro had been neither as smart or as quick!) was a small paragraph that I added to the <A HREF="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2004/12/06/276122.html">6.0</A>, <A HREF="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2004/12/06/276123.html">7.0</A>, <A HREF="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2004/12/06/276124.html">7.1</A>, and <A HREF="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/10/07/478235.html">8.0</A> versions of the instructions (with the red emphasis included in each!):</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face=Tahoma color=#ff0000 size=2>In all instructions below, the assumption is a default install path and an en-US copy of Windows; if either is not the case, make sure you replace paths such as <STRONG>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio&nbsp;2003</STRONG>&nbsp;with the appropriate install location.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Because this problem can occur any time there is a change due to:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Installation to the default location on a non-English version of Windows</LI>
<LI>Installation on another drive</LI>
<LI>Installation to a different path</LI></UL>
<P>I had initially started changing all paths in the instruction for the first item, when I realized the second and third items made it more important to just let the person who knows where everything is installed make the changes here, as needed.</P>
<P>Thanks for the heads-up, Leandro!</P></FONT>

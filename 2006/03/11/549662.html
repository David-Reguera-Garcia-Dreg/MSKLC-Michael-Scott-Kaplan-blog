<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The other day, I got an email from James Todd:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face=Georgia size=2>Hello Michael,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Georgia size=2>My name is James Todd and I’m a new employee SDE in the SQL Server org in building ##. I’ve been reading your blog externally for a while now, and on rare occasion I posted on it as ‘James Todd’. (You may recall a post of yours about a problem with unicows corrupting the floating point control word.)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Georgia size=2>Anyway, I just wanted to say that reading your blog was always educational for me, and it helped me decide to come to MS. I’m happy to be here, and I just bookmarked your blog here on my new machine. J</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Georgia size=2>Thanks!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Now stuff like that happens to people like <A HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/jobsblog/">Gretchen</A> all the time, but it is something new for me so I figured I would post about it....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>While I am on the subject of jobs and hiring and such, I thought I would point out two different roles in GIFT test that we are looking for the right person for (look <A href="http://members.microsoft.com/careers/search/details.aspx?JobID=547B7E55-1237-411F-92D4-D469567DC48A">here</A> and <A href="http://members.microsoft.com/careers/search/details.aspx?JobID=DE8C2232-5D8A-4554-B806-D0712B69C8E8">here</A> for the listings).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>As I have mentioned before, <A HREF="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/01/04/346116.html">International Test is an art, and there are few fine artists</A>. We have a small cadre of them now, but we are looking to make it a little bigger, so if you are interested you can take a look. :-)</FONT></P>

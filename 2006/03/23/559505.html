<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So, it was yesterday, just before 12pm, and I scooted by Cathy's office and asked her if she wanted to do lunch. She did, but she was IM'ing with someone, so I suggested she just ask&nbsp;her if she wanted to come along.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>As luck would have it (and&nbsp;contrary&nbsp;to my usual life!) there were now two women&nbsp;who were interested, though&nbsp;our third&nbsp;needed a few minutes to do something. I pointed out that Cathy and I would be waiting with bated breath....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Which got me wondering aloud in front of Cathy's office about whether it was 'bated breath' or 'baited breath', which had several consequences:</FONT></P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>We both forgot to not breathe while we discussed the point, which was probably good since it took her more than 10 minutes to show up;</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Cathy got to show off the fact that she had just been looking at this question a few days ago and had the answer -- it is <STRONG>bated breath</STRONG>;</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Since she had no cite I declared a penalty and she did not get credit for having the answer;</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>She was actually right, as articles like <A href="http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-bai1.htm">this one</A> point out.</FONT></LI></UL>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>In that article, Michael Quinion has some interesting points about the particular problems here -- a classical expression that makes use of a word no longer in use, but with an identically sounding&nbsp;different word in the language.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>How long before the only people who are making the correction are British Lit. teachers grading high school essays on Shakespeare? :-)</FONT></P>

<p><a id="559987" href="#559987">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 24 Mar 2006 11:26 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Very funny Alun -- although most of those words are still in use. :-)</div>
<p><a id="559999" href="#559999">#</a> <strong>Alun Jones</strong> on 24 Mar 2006 11:41 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Okay, my last comment was a pane to right, and was probably just as much of a pain to read.<br><br>For those of us that are literate (in that we read books), much blame can be put on the reluctance of editors to include apostrophes to indicate where letters have been dropped.<br><br>'plane - used to be &quot;airplane&quot; or &quot;aeroplane&quot;<br>'bated - from &quot;abated&quot;<br><br>Michael's point that the correct versions of my fractured words are still in use suggests that &quot;whet&quot; and &quot;abated&quot; are not. &nbsp;My local cub scout pack know about whetting, and using a whetstone to whet a knife or axe. &nbsp;As for &quot;abated&quot;, I'm pretty sure that most of the people I have told about &quot;bated breath&quot;'s derivation from &quot;abated breath&quot; have immediately seen this as an obvious way to remember the spelling.<br><br>English is perhaps the least phonetic of all phonetic languages, largely because of the sheer number of words co-opted from other languages. &nbsp;Learning English spelling through listening alone is doomed to failure.<br><br>Clearly, the examples I chose to malapropriate above are word usages that are in danger of becoming archaic. &nbsp;My last boss used &quot;should of&quot; in many places, and the frequent mis-spellings of her variable names and function names caused me unceasing delays while trying to find code that I knew existed; as somewhat of a fast reader who reads the shape of words, rather than the individual letters, her constant lack of any kind of consistent spelling or grammar made what would otherwise have been a sprint into a hurdles race, as I had to keep stopping my reading in order to figure out what words she meant.<br><br>[I had other issues with that job, but these are the only ones related to this post.]</div>
<p><strong>Tammie</strong> on 13 Jun 2008 1:42 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Thank you! I realize that this is an old post of yours but it just settled another grammar war! My Mom and I go rounds debating weather its 'baited' or 'bated', and occasionally 'dammit' or 'damnit', but your article (well, and lets be fair, Shakespeare) proved me, once again, the winner of the grammar war... this time. </p></div>

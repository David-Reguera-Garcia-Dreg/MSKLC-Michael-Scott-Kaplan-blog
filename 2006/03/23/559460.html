<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Over at <A href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/">Language Log Plaza</A>, Eric Bakovic was <A href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002946.html">gushing a bit</A> about Apple stuff, and he did note a few sentences in interviews that he found to be ambiguous. The one that struck my eye:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P>Except that one day in the near recent past everybody woke up and found out that while all the geniuses were blathering on about content this and content that, the media culture had, in fact, come to be dominated by machines. <B>It's Steve's gadget- centric world which we just live in.</B></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Isn't it sort of saying that (emphasis added)&nbsp;<FONT color=#0000ff><EM>it is <STRONG>Steve Jobs' </STRONG>gadget-centric world;</EM>&nbsp;the rest of just live here (and have no claim on the world!)</FONT> or something like that?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>A sort of poetic, Vanity Fair way of how Triumph (the insult comic dog) e</FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>xplains/describes the way that everyone flocked to Star Wars sequels in a <A href="http://www.milkandcookies.com/article/924/">bit</A> from Late Night:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>"<FONT face="Times New Roman">...thousands of 35-year-old men waiting days even months for just a taste of George Lucas' table scraps...lonely men who have never had sex... </FONT>"</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Eric is probably right though. I may be reading too much into this.... :-)</FONT></P>

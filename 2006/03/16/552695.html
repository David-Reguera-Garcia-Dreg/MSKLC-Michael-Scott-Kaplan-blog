<P><FONT face=Tahoma>A little information about Kannada (<FONT size=4>ಕನ್ನಡ</FONT>):</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>Kannada is the state language of Karnataka, where it is mainly spoken, and one of India's many official languages. Sometimes also called Kanarese, Kannada is one of the Dravidian languages spoken in the South of India. It has about 20 dialects which can differ considerably, though the written form is rather consistent throughout.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>Kannada, together with Tamil, Malayalam and others, belongs to the Southern group of the Dravidian languages. These form a language family on its own. Its languages are spoken on the Indian subcontinent, but are not related at all to Indic languages of the Indo-European family (like Hindi): The Dravidian languages are agglutinative (Words are formed by joining morphemes together) and have the interesting feature of an exclusive "we" (in which the addressee is not included).</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P dir=ltr><FONT face=Tahoma>Kannada is written with the Kannada script, which is supported by the Tunga font in Windows (which is used in the Uniscribe font fallback list on XP machines that have the font correctly installed, for a&nbsp;seamless Kannada user experience!)</FONT></P>

I have already downloaded it and playing with it. I am bit unhappy with the somewhat inferiror quality of the translations. Consistency is missing at some places. Context of the word is not given importance at some places while translating.<br><br>Coming to the comment by Karl-<br>&gt; Thursday, March 16, 2006 11:20 AM by Karl <br>&gt; Oh no Telugu :-) How come Kannada comes first before Telugu, <br>&gt; &nbsp;when they have borrowed their script from Telugu. <br><br>This is not true. The oldest Dravidian script is Tamil. Then Kannada, followed by Telugu and the youngest one is Malayalam.<br><br>There are other Dravidian languages like Tulu, Kodava (Coorgi), which had their own script once upon a time, but have lost them. Kodava, Tulu and some Konkani speakers use Kannada script nowadays.<br><br>Regards,<br>Pavanaja</div>

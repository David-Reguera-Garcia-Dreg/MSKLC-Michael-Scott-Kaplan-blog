<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I was looking at Larry's <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/larryosterman/archive/2006/03/15/552071.aspx">anniversary blog post</A>, and that <A href="http://blogs.technet.com/exchange/archive/2004/04/08/109626.aspx">Bedlam DL3</A> link brought back some memories.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Not about Bedlam DL3 itself (I was on one of the other experimental DLs and apparently the one I was on had none of those people who would send&nbsp;"me too" mails!).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It was actually a fellow developer over in Access who was fascinated about the new Jet MAPI IISAM that I was writing a wizard for, and the possible queries he could run.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>You see, he had already hypothesized about using a linked table pointing at the Global Address Book inside of Microsoft to try determine other patterns, such as trying to&nbsp;identify a&nbsp;correlation between job title and vegetarian meals being ordered at events.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And he was blocked of course by not really having access to the information about who had ordered particular meals. How depressing....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But by being one of the people on Bedlam DL3, and apparently one of the first 8000 members, he had all the "me too" posts sitting in his inbox,&nbsp;and he was really interested in trying to&nbsp;look at&nbsp;the job titles of those who actually posted "me too" in order to look for correlations.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>(I suggested this seemed&nbsp;a&nbsp;tad excessive, if not obsessive, but to the man who counted ceiling tiles to try to determine senority and was frustrated by the diasgonal offices in Building 1 that stymied the counts, to the man actually had in the past looked back to the Access 1.1 SLM logs three versions later to track down who had caused a particular bug, such a suggestion did not really have much influence!)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I never did find out if he created the program he was going to use to do his little cross-disciplinary study, but I think about the way he would passionately describe&nbsp;the plan&nbsp;any time someone brings up Bedlam DL3, and smile.... :-)</FONT></P>

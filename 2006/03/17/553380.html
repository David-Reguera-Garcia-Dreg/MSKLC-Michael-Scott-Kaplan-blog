<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So I was talking to Cathy yesterday just before leaving work. And I mentioned how it was probably not true that people could really detect an infinite number of emotional, psychological, and moral shadings,&nbsp;as I could not the tell the difference between a Winchell and a Lippman.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><EM>(the former allusion was to a quote from Leslie Stefanson from the movie version of Nelson's DeMille's </EM><A href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0144214/"><EM>The General's Daughter</EM></A><EM>:</EM></FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=1>The human eye can distinguish 15 or 16 shades of gray. A computer image processor can distinguish 256 shades of gray, which is impressive. More impressive, however, is the human heart, mind, and soul, which can distinguish an infinite amount of emotional, psychological, and moral shadings, from the blackest of black to the whitest of white.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><EM>and the latter was from Robert A. Heinlein's Stranger in a Strange Land. And&nbsp;to be as&nbsp;cynical&nbsp;about the press&nbsp;as&nbsp;Jubal Harshaw is as to not be able to know the difference between <A href="http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1117444">Walter Winchell</A> and <A href="http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1176848">Walter Lippmann</A> DOES mean one has a dim view of the press!)</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Cathy took a different tack and suggested that she couldn't even tell the difference between a Winchell and a <A href="http://www.krispykreme.com/">Krispy Kreme</A>.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I wondered aloud how one could mistake a gossip columnist for a doughnut.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>At which point she reminded me that these days the name 'Winchell' is much more likely to represent <A href="http://www.winchells.com/">Winchell's Donuts</A> than&nbsp;the columnist.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>At that point I was tempted to bring this very cross-eyed conversation into an even stranger but perhaps more relevant place by pointing out that Lippmann was&nbsp;seen by many&nbsp;as the&nbsp;moral and ethical&nbsp;antithesis of Noam Chomsky.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But I decided it made more sense to just go home and try again the next day, given that&nbsp;the references were already getting a bit too confusing to keep track of....</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I went to see <A href="http://www.kristinconnell.com/">Kristin Connell</A> at <A href="http://www.flyinglioncafe.com/">The Flying Lion Cafe</A> in West Seattle last night. It was an 'In the Round' show feauring Kristin, <A href="http://www.seanbendickson.com/">Sean Bendickson</A>&nbsp;(who I had seen a couple of months ago at St. Clouds), <A href="http://www.juliadumas.com/">Julia Dumas</A> (who I had not seen before, and who </FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>did point out that her last name was pronounced without the 's' -- so it was not dumbass!), and Ben Fuller.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><A href="http://brightsidebroadcast.com/">Bright Side Broadcast</A> even did a podcast of the show....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Before the show I talked to Kristin for a bit and she once again asked if I had a myspace page (I don't, though it seems all of the musicians I listen to do?). </FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>he glances at this blog a bit, but I am sure I'll have to talk more about the shows I go to if I want to hold the interest. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Anyway, the show was a very interesting mix of styles and themes -- you would have a hard time finding four local artists who you would think were less likely be together.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But I think the show worked, and everyone ended up getting laughs for the between show banter, and even some of the song titles and stories.&nbsp;Ms. Dumas&nbsp;even did a little Britney Spears cover, which of course left poor Ben wondering how he was supposed to follow <STRONG>that</STRONG>. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Going back a few weeks (the week before the IUC), I was down in San Fransisco watching Kathleen Edwards at the Swedish and American Hall. I probably ought to post about <EM>that</EM> show at some pont, too. I'll do that soon....</FONT></P>

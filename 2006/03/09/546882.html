<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I embarrassed myself a little bit at one of my presentations, yesterday.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I was doing my <STRONG><A HREF="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/11/21/495389.html">Tales of Incorrect String Comparisons</A></STRONG> talk, and I did the following:</FONT></P>
<OL>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>On a machine with Windows Server 2003 and an early 2005 CTP build of SQL&nbsp;</FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>Server 2005 that supports Windows authentication</FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>, create two user accounts on the local machine, named '<STRONG>AdminЀ</STRONG>' and '<STRONG>AdminЀЀЀЀ</STRONG>'.</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Open up SQL Server Management Studio, pick any database and run the following two queries:<BR><BR></FONT><FONT face="Courier New"><STRONG>&nbsp;create user "</STRONG><FONT face=Tahoma>MICHKAP3\AdminЀ</FONT><STRONG>"</STRONG><BR><STRONG>&nbsp;create user "</STRONG><FONT face=Tahoma>MICHKAP3\AdminЀЀЀЀ</FONT><STRONG>"</STRONG></FONT></LI></OL>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>As I am sure you can guess, that character at the end is one of those that have <A HREF="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/01/18/355210.html">no weight</A>....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The result for that second query:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face=Tahoma color=#ff0000>Msg 15023, Level 16, State 1, Line 1<BR>User, group, or role 'MICHKAP3\AdminЀ' already exists in the current database.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Basically, SQL Server is validating the entry using its own collation rules -- whether it is doing some sort of optimization here to avoid the performance hit of a call to do the Windows authentication, or whether it is simply storing the entries in a uniquely indexed column that does not allow its own collation rules to be broken, it is clearly not allowing two different valid Windows accounts to be used here.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><EM>(this was a problem I had reported early last year, along with another few bugs that were fixed, and I was told this one had been fixed)</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Anyway, I then did the same steps on a different setup with a released version of SQL Server 2005 that I had spent half the night installing onto another VPC machine.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I mentioned as this VPC machine was loading that I had just installed it last night and had not even tested it out....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>(note to self -- even if&nbsp;I am tired and even if&nbsp;<A href="http://www.microsoft.com/billgates/speeches/04-19spcomdex.asp">I&nbsp;am not doing a billg demo</A>,&nbsp;I should still check the demo,&nbsp;especially if I am sure that I know what will happen)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The result?</FONT></P><FONT face=Tahoma>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face=Tahoma color=#ff0000>Msg 15023, Level 16, State 1, Line 1<BR>User, group, or role 'MICHKAP7\AdminЀ' already exists in the current database.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE></FONT>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I was shocked.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I thought I covered okay by acting dramatic about the situation as if this was what I expected, but the folks who knew me (and at least one of the ones who didn't) noticed I was not expecting that result.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Damn.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Ah well, at least it was a good example of some type of comparison operation that was not being performed correctly.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><EM>(And it was not really as bad as the one with Chris and the USB scanner, or even the other one with Tod and the Access 95 demo, a story for another day!)</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I think the other examples, of problems&nbsp;that had been fixed were for the most part technically cooler, though I suspect that the one they will remember was the SQL Server one.... :-)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma><A href="http://babelstone.blogspot.com/">Andrew West</A> has started a very interesting series entitled <STRONG>Unicode Character Names</STRONG>.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Check out Part 1 (<A href="http://babelstone.blogspot.com/2006/03/unicode-character-names-part-1-good.html">the Good the Bad and the Ugly</A>) and Part 2 (<A href="http://babelstone.blogspot.com/2006/03/unicode-character-names-part-2-name-is.html">a Name is for Life</A>). And if you are like me you'll be waiting and hoping for additional parts in the future! :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>My favorite piece so far is at the end of Part 2:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT size=2>Since the merger between Unicode and ISO/IEC 10646 only two characters have ever changed their name, namely U+00C6 and U+00E6, which were originally called <SMALL>LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A E</SMALL> and <SMALL>LATIN SMALL LETTER A E</SMALL> in Unicode 1.0, then changed to <SMALL>LATIN CAPITAL LIGATURE AE</SMALL> and <SMALL>LATIN SMALL LIGATURE AE</SMALL> in Unicode 1.1 after the merger with ISO/IEC 10646, and finally changed to their current names <SMALL>LATIN CAPITAL LETTER AE</SMALL> and <SMALL>LATIN SMALL LETTER AE</SMALL> in Unicode 2.0. The latter change was due to representations by the Danish Standards Association who considered these two characters to be letters rather than ligatures; but this caused so much trouble and acrimony that the respective committees of Unicode and ISO/IEC 10646 resolved never again to make any name changes, regardless of the severity of the mistake or the triviality of the change required (see the </FONT><A href="http://www.unicode.org/standard/stability_policy.html"><FONT color=#5588aa size=2>Unicode Standard Stability Policy</FONT></A><FONT size=2>).</FONT></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Why is it my favorite?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><EM>(perhaps I should say favourite given the British slant on names?)</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Well, it is an issue that comes up a <STRONG>lot</STRONG> and people simply don't appreciate what a nightmare it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;to deal with a constant flurry of name changing requests. There would be no time to encode any actual characters!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>In any case, I am glad that BabelStone is on the lists of <A HREF="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2004/12/18/325156.html">blogs I read</A>, because if it were not I would miss gems like this....</FONT></P>

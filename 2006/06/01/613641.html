<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>Hello, I'd like to know a bit of background on the reasons taken to deviate from keyboard standards in the Microsoft layouts.<BR><BR>For instance the Arabic Yeh with Hamza would be Unicode 0626 in the new Pashto (Afghanistan) keyboard but Microsofts new implementaion (897338) uses FE89 presentation form which as far as I can tell has no advantage and a pretty major disadvantage (0626 will join to stuff, FE89 doesn't). <BR><BR>Just curious! </FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>An excellent point -- one that I have even mentioned myself in posts like <A HREF="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/10/07/478127.html"><STRONG>It does not always pay to be compatible</STRONG></A> in the past.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>This was actually a bug in an earlier version of the layout which has since been fixed. The fix first made it into the source tree back in December of last year, so any recent build or Beta 2 should have the update.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And of course Vista keeps looking better with newer builds, so there are probably other reasons to upgrade to later builds. :-)</FONT></P>

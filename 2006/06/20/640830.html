<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I admit that it is a lot of different factors just kind of converging, but I realized today as I was scooting to work that the weather which used to inspire me to want to drive the Saab around is now the weather that I'd rather be scooting in.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So combine that with the fact that I miss not having a trunk to use -- since the smaller Go-Go scooter pretty much takes up the whole trunk of the Saab, a fact that I am reminded of every time I am out of town and I rent a car. Every other trunk in the universe can more easily fit the scooter and usually a bit more like my bag.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Now factor in that Barrier Saab has closed down, so that the closest Saab dealer, instead of being nearby within scooting distance, is much further away.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>When you get down to it, a convertible in Seattle is a little bit silly. I don't think I would have bothered were it not for the memory of the convertibles that I used to own (I should probably tell the stories of those vehicles, there is happy, sad, angry, joyful, and more across the lot of them -- another day, perhaps....).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Of course I will miss the trips up and down the coast following people like Aimee Mann and Kathleen Edwards in the convertible, but all that anyone ever earned from doing the trip in the Saab was when John sunburned his head!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So maybe it is time to say that the convertible phase of my life is over. I said the same thing with the stick shift phase too... maybe it is a part of growing up!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So, anyone interested in a 1995 Black Saab Convertible? :-)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>After <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/clintcovington/">Clint</A> posted <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/clintcovington/archive/2006/03/23/558942.aspx">Death of an old friend -- Data Access Pages</A>, I do not feel quite as guilty that I have not really done anything with the <A href="http://trigeminal.com/utility.asp?ItemID=0">TSI Form/Report to Data Access Page Wizard</A> since Access 2002 (I have been told it mostly works in Access 2003 but it has not been tested there so the <STRONG><A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/11/12/491519.html">tester's axioms</A></STRONG> and the meaning of the word <STRONG><A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/08/21/454247.html">unsupported</A></STRONG> have relevance).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I guess you can now say with the technology no longer functioning in new versions of the product that it is double secret unsupported!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><EM>TRUE STORY: A few years back the Access team offered to buy the wizard and I offered to sell it at cost (I paid someone else to do all but the internationalizing of it), but the deal never really worked out for reasons that probably would make a fascinating blog post if I ever left Microsoft; for now you'll just have to use your imagination. :-)</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So farewell to the wizard, which managed to double my old site's traffic to half a million hits a month after the international Office Update sites chose to link to this little wizard that was localized into more languages than Access itself is....</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>My Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (<A href="http://www.hcoa.org/hcoacme/chf-cme/chf00048.htm">LVEF</A>) is still about the same, which means my heart is still in the right place. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Anyway, this means that&nbsp;soon I'll be ready for more Novantrone -- infusion #4, this time. Things seem to be going nicely still, not much else to report on the MS front. This is generally a good thing -- an area where no news can definitely be thought of as good news....</FONT></P>

I have had only one exacerbation since I started but that was a stress related one that only lasted a few days. The Novantrone has relieved the bulk of my acute symptoms while not affecting the chronic ones (so it has acted as a reset button of sorts on my immune system!)....</div>

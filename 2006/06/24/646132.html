<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I've been wanting to do a post about the font folder for a while now, and Simon Daniels has given me some additional ideas that will stretch that into two or maybe three posts.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Just thought I'd give you all a heads up on what I was going to be posting about tomorrow. It wil be firmly entrenched in the Windows fonts folder and installing fonts in general. :-)</FONT></P>

I know virtually nothing about the Windows fonts folder. Many people hate the Mac OS X's multiple fonts folders (System, &quot;Local&quot;, Network, User, and Classic). It becomes hard to deal with everything has having multiple duplicate fonts is very possible and almost the case on every single Mac OS X box.<br><br>The good thing though is that any font dragged into a Mac OS X font folder is available to all applications immediately.<br></div>

Seems like a funny omission.<br><br></div>

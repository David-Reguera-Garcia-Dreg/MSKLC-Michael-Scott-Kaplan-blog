<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Eric Sassaman (the MVP lead who has helped to keep me and my team involved whenever the MVP Summit has been happening at Microsoft) sent me some mail the other day about a cool project (currently in beta) that Dr. Joseph M. Newcomer put up on his website.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>(the site is very cool in general, and have enjoyed this glimpse into a great mind of computer science and also of typography and other interests!)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>You can check it out <A href="http://www.flounder.com/localeexplorer.htm">The Locale Explorer</A> here.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And every single developer, tester, and program manager on my team involved with NLS support on Windows will definitely want to take a look here -- this project can be thought of a great example of a smart developer who has taken the time (though docs and actual usage) to understand the NLS API, to the point where any time <STRONG>he</STRONG> gets something wrong, we as a team should perhaps assume that is actually <STRONG>we</STRONG> were the ones who got some sort of explanation wrong that contributed to the problem....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And although, as he says in his disclaimer at the bottom of the page:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>The views expressed in these essays are those of the author, and in no way represent, nor are they endorsed by, Microsoft. </FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I'll have to say </FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>that I highly recommend taking a look at this fascinating deep view of NLS support on Windows from someone outside of Microsoft</FONT></P>

<p>Just a follow-up to my friend Liz's <strong><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/12/30/6907073.html">I am not Michael</a></strong> post from Sunday.</p>
<p>My friend Liz was visiting for the weekend, and I let her use my MacBook Pro booted into <font color="#999966">Panther</font><strong><font color="#ff0000"><strike>Leopard</strike></font></strong> (she is a Mac fan, always has been) to check e-mail. </p>
<p>I did not remember that I even <strong>had</strong> logged in to the blog on that machine, but obviously I had.</p>
<p>Now this is someone I would trust with my life (and come to think of it actually did trust with my life on one occasion!), so I am not going to worry too much about any evil being done here.</p>
<p>But I think I have learned my lesson now though about remembering logins to websites....</p>
<p>Hope you all enjoyed the weirdness. I'll post about the weekend itself in a moment, the post is almost done.</p>

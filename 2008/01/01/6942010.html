<p>Just a follow-up to my friend Liz's <b><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/12/30/6907073.html" class="" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/12/30/6907073.html">I am not Michael</a></b> post from Sunday.</p>

<p>My friend Liz was visiting for the weekend, and I let her use my MacBook Pro booted into <font color="#999966"><strike>Panther</strike></font><b><font color="#ff0000">Leopard</font></b> (she is a Mac fan, always has been) to check e-mail. </p>

<p>I did not remember that I even <b>had</b> logged in to the blog on that machine, but obviously I had.</p>

<p>Now this is someone I would trust with my life (and come to think of it actually did trust with my life on one occasion!), so I am not going to worry too much about any evil being done here.</p>

<p>But I think I have learned my lesson now though about remembering logins to websites....</p>

<p>Hope you all enjoyed the weirdness. I'll post about the weekend itself in a moment, the post is almost done.</p>

<p>Call me paranoid or whatever, I don't even trust immediate family for them using my machine, let alone friends and co-workers.</p>
<p>Not the family might be due to me being the only programmer in the family rest being teachers, but friends can act exactly like Liz and sometimes much worse.</p>

<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 3 Jan 2008 6:07 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>There is a very very VERY small list of people who I would trust implicitly in just about anything (up to and including if they wanted to hypnotize me because they had just taken a class in it), certainly that I trust not to abuse the trust related to the blog.</p>
<p>But my family? I moved out of the house over two decades ago and when I left there was no one I trusted that much back then. Trust like that is not easily extended, ever (and is never automatic)....</p>

<P>Over on the Microsoft VOLT users community, SpaceyT-17 asked:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><EM><FONT face="times new roman,times">What updates related to Uniscribe, locales and language support are to be released in Windows XP Service Pack 3?</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>To which O2K answered:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times">I wanted to ask the same. But seems it's not finalize yet and they are not disclosing anything about it. :(</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Though to be honest some of this has been answered, in blogs like <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/08/09/449405.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/08/09/449405.html"><STRONG>ELK stampede!</STRONG></A> (which has the 10 locales added post XPSP2 which are <EM>possibly</EM> going to be in the service pack.</P>
<P>And then there is <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/11/27/6544551.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/11/27/6544551.html"><STRONG>How many versions does a bug have to exist before backporting the fix can't be successfully argued?</STRONG></A>, which&nbsp;pointed out a request to put the Romanian&nbsp;keyboard updates into the service pack, and the similar question about the Romanian/Bulgarian font updates I have talked about many times <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/05/08/2474854.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/05/08/2474854.html"><STRONG>in</STRONG></A> <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/12/09/1245128.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/12/09/1245128.html"><STRONG>the</STRONG></A> <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/11/19/1104093.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/11/19/1104093.html"><STRONG>past</STRONG></A>.</P>
<P>So we don't know for sure, but clearly there are ten locales, a bunch of fonts, some keyboards, and no Uniscribe updates that are potential candidates based on these already available downloadable updates....</P>

<P>I tested this and have successfully developed the first smartfont for any language with an existing (complex) script. The beauty of the solution is that the language is instantly enabled in all regular commercial applications which, after all, is the ultimate goal of Unicode.</P>

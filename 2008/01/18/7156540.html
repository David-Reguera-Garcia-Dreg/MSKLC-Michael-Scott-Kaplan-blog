<P>So you know that person I have talked about who is in love with my blog?</P>
<P>I did suggest to her that this point,&nbsp;with me&nbsp;leaving town, and the state, and the country, and the continent for a bit, and with posts perhaps coming in at unusual times, it might be time to take a break from that.</P>
<P>You know, to get a real sense of the overall importance of the blog without the artificial&nbsp;closeness&nbsp;that temporal and spacial proximity provide, but won't soon since I will be in a totally different time zone and many miles away.</P>
<P>So she has agreed to not read the blog until I get back to town. We'll just call it a trial separation.</P>
<P>And then she'll know whether she is truly in love with&nbsp;the blog&nbsp;(love can be hard to pin down when one has the proximity since all kinds of things can feel similar, especially when the object of affection is an inanimate object and all....</P>
<P>I'll let you know how it turns out, either way. But I'm thinking she'll realize that it was just a seasonal thing. :-)</P>

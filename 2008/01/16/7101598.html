<h1>Heading over to India, for a bit</h1>
<p><em>by Michael S. Kaplan, published on 2008/01/16 07:01 -08:00, original URI: http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/archive/2008/01/16/7101598.aspx</em></p>
<hr/> <!-- Archival Source: ProcessPostOld -->
<P>The folks in Tamil Nadu really wanted more time to talk to people on the Unicode side -- a technical meeting of the UTC South Asia Subcommittee of the Unicode Consortium on issues relating to encoding of Tamil characters.</P>
<P>As a colleague stated in describing this meeting: "<EM>...to understand the practical problems that are encountered with Tamil (and other Indic scripts), and what the consortium can do to help with those problems. It is also to help the Tamil participants understand what the constraints on Unicode are, and the ways in which the Unicode encoding is used to deal with Tamil text.</EM>"</P>
<P>So some people are traveling from the West coast of the United States to Chennai, to have that conversation, and together continue to&nbsp;determine how best to make sure that&nbsp;the needs of the script and of the language are met. It is never a bad idea to have smart people discuss problems. :-)</P>
<P>I am one of the people who was asked&nbsp;whether I could&nbsp;be there, in light of my past work [with|in|for|on] Tamil.</P>
<P>Interestingly,&nbsp;some of the reasons for the problem is more than a little to do with&nbsp;Microsoft's&nbsp;implementation of Tamil support (even when Unicode is blamed)&nbsp;-- in particular:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the keyboard (which is really awful by any&nbsp;stretch of the imagination, an issue I have talked about before and tried in vain to get changed for several&nbsp;years now). Microsoft is the fullest and widest implementation available and unfortunately our lack is widely [inaccurately]&nbsp;perceived as a Unicode lack that has remained unaddressed after eight years and&nbsp;sucessive versions of Windows, Win2000 and beyond, and</LI>
<LI>to a lesser extent, the font (<STRONG>Latha</STRONG>, which is generally perceived as being a bit too&nbsp;"relaxed" of a style&nbsp;by some, depending on the intended purpose&nbsp;-- in part due to all of the downsides of UI fonts when used for documents, and so on).</LI></UL>
<P>Now this trip to India <STRONG>is not being funded by Microsoft in any way whatsoever</STRONG> -- not&nbsp;for the plane ticket, not even for the hours spent (I am taking it as vacation time) as the meeting&nbsp;"doesn’t have enough business justifications to send over a person representing Microsoft... ...and it is [therefore] considered as a personal trip." </P>
<P>So despite Microsoft's implicit connection to some small part the problem, a trip to talk to the people tasked to&nbsp;investigate, understand,&nbsp;and solve&nbsp;the issues related to Tamil and Unicode is not considered part of the job.</P>
<P>And so it goes -- <STRONG>the sophistries of&nbsp;large corporations</STRONG>. :-(</P>
<P>Feh, I say. And Feh again....</P>
<P>But this trip&nbsp;<STRONG>is</STRONG> important, in&nbsp;my opinion. So I am going to go, and&nbsp;use a little&nbsp;of&nbsp;my vacation time. </P>
<P>Since I don't make it to India very often, and since I spent my last vacation sick at home, I am going to take&nbsp;some actual&nbsp;vacation while I am there (since it&nbsp;is being labeled <STRONG>personal time</STRONG> anyway!).</P>
<P><EM>Perhaps this is also partially to make up for a trip I made to Malaysia several years ago right around the Windows&nbsp;XP ship date for a presentation&nbsp;at Tamil Internet 2001&nbsp;-- where I spent more time in the air traveling to and from the conference than&nbsp;I did on the ground in Kuala Lumpur, all to help meet a ship date....</EM></P>
<P>Plus&nbsp;while I am in TN perhaps lunch or dinner with&nbsp;long time&nbsp;INFITT colleagues and a few others. That <EM>is</EM> personal time, but worth the time, I think. </P>
<P>I don't think I'll make it to Calcutta this trip (something I have been wanting to do for a long time, in fact one of three&nbsp;places I have wanted to&nbsp;visit&nbsp;in that part of the world but have not managed to yet). I'll have to figure out how to get it done another time, on another visit....</P>
<P>This has got to be the best time of year for me to be in India, climate wise -- which is a very pleasant coincidence that&nbsp;I will do my best to enjoy. :-)</P>
<P>I will not take any time spent at various Microsoft spots giving presentations, etc. as vacation time, for obvious reasons. But that is worthwhile, too.</P>
<P><EM>It could be worse;&nbsp;Microsoft really&nbsp;had&nbsp;trouble with&nbsp;that Malaysia trip in 2001&nbsp;and it was only the fact that I was not a full-time employee at the time that kept them from requiring me to send my regrets to the conference organizers back then -- something I regret to this day considering that a mere 11 days later I was in LA a mere 14 days later 9/11 happened and the likelihood of a return trip was sharply curbed. amd a year later I <STRONG>became</STRONG> a full-time employee....</EM></P>
<P>Though to make sure there are no misunderstandings, I have neither&nbsp;intent nor inclination to speak "for Microsoft" while I am there -- I am there as someone who wishes to be&nbsp;helpful seriously discussing Tamil. </P>
<P>If I had&nbsp;a Tamil Linux distro up and running on my MacBook Pro I could easily have planned to spend the trip doing comparative evaluations of Windows vs. Linux in Tamil and other Indic languages, which is definitely outside the charter of my work. This is <STRONG>personal</STRONG> time, after all! :-)</P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000>I'm heading out on <STRONG>the 21st of January</STRONG> and I'll <EM>probably</EM> be heading back to Redmond&nbsp;on the <STRONG>1st of February</STRONG>. If you work for Microsoft and are in Chennai or Bangalore or Delhi or&nbsp;Hyderabad or a few other places than I <EM>may</EM> see you while I'm there (and if you want to increase the odds then be sure to send me email or use the Contact link!).</FONT></P>
<P mce_keep="true">In the meantime, while I am gone you may see a lot of pre-recorded blog posts, including:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<DIV mce_keep="true">The continuation/conclusion of my series on reversing sort keys, and</DIV></LI>

<P mce_keep="true">For the latter, what better&nbsp;could I&nbsp;do&nbsp;for people who care about the Tamil language than an attempt at a&nbsp;solution using built-in technologies in Vista&nbsp;that Microsoft could simply decide to put in-box in a future version of Windows or maybe even as an optional download before that? :-)</P>

<p>I flew to Chennai from the East Coast in August 2003. &nbsp;It's a long flight (Tampa-Cincinnati-Paris-Mubai) and I overnighted in Mumbai (Bombay) before continuing to Chennai on a domestic airline. &nbsp;Advice: if you have airline miles, use them to upgrade out of tourist class: you'll be able to sleep, work, and eat better.</p>
<p>I was contracting for Wipro Technologies and stayed for two weeks at a nice resort-y place south of the city. &nbsp;Take your camera-the area is visually overlading. &nbsp;Hotels and offices are usually okay for 110VAC power but I suggest taking a power conversion kit anyway (in case the hotel has a limited number of 110VAC outlets).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my sightseeing weekend was cut out of the plan: I had to leave a week early because my house in Florida was in the path of a threatening hurricane (I solved that problem by moving here, thus trading hurricanes for earthquakes and reliance on the Washington State Ferry system).</p>
<p>Everybody I met was very nice-remants of British civility! &nbsp;I'm not a big fan of Indian food, so I probably missed several adventures. &nbsp;You'll have a blast and I'd go back in a heartbeat. &nbsp;I'm settling for a solo trip to Hawai'i in March-aloha!</p></div>
<p><a id="7133195" href="#7133195">#</a> <strong>Reeve Fritchman</strong> on Wednesday, January 16, 2008 1:05 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Follow-up: when I asked my Tamil Nadu friends about the weather, they provided the answer: depending upon the season, it's &quot;hot, hotter, hottest!&quot;</p></div>
<p><a id="7133226" href="#7133226">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on Wednesday, January 16, 2008 1:11 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><P>From Wikipedia's article on Chennai's climate:</P>
<P>----------------------------------------------</P>
<P>Chennai lies on the thermal equator and is also coastal, which prevents extreme variation in seasonal temperature. For most of the year, the weather is hot and humid. The hottest part of the year is late May and early June, known locally as Agni Nakshatram ("fire star") or as Kathiri Veyyil,[26] with maximum temperatures around 38–42 °C (100–107 °F). <STRONG><FONT color=#ff0000>The coolest part of the year is January, with minimum temperatures around 19–20 °C (66–68 °F)</FONT></STRONG>. The lowest temperature recorded is 15.8 °C (60.44 °F) and highest 45 °C (113 °F).[27][28] The average annual rainfall is about 1,300 mm (51 inches). The city gets most of its seasonal rainfall from the north-east monsoon winds, from mid-September to mid-December. Cyclones in the Bay of Bengal sometimes hit the city. Highest annual rainfall recorded is 2,570 mm (101 in) in 2005.[29] The most prevailing winds in Chennai are the South-westerly between May and September and the North-easterly during the rest of the year.</P>
<P>----------------------------------------------</P>
<P>So if I will be there this looks like the best possible time (remembering my summers in Philadelphia with the 90 degree, 99% humidity weeks!)....</P>

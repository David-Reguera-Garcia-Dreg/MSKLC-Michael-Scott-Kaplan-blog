<P>On the whole, the only real answer here is an upgrade since a lot of the basic language support needed for Tamil is only available in Windows 2000 and later.</P>
<P>But some prior versions of Internet Explorer provided (vis MLang and Uniscribe) a limited amount of support for "Unicode-only" languages such as Tamil that would work on Windows 98 and Windows Me. Getting the most recent version of Internet Explorer that will install on the machine is a way to get things as best as&nbsp;they can be....</P>
<P>Still missing is a bunch of the support one really wants on the input/typography/globalization side, even with the best effort work that went into MLang and Uniscribe.</P>
<P>Windows 98 just came before Windows was really looking at this scenario....</P>

<h1>I don't know about knowing the people who say they DK (don't know) me</h1>

<P>I have been&nbsp;mildly passive in <STRONG>LinkedIn</STRONG> and <STRONG>facebook</STRONG>, up to now.</P>
<P>Basically, if someone invites me to become a part of their network or whatever, and I know them, then I </P>
<UL>
<LI>accept their invite, and</LI>
<LI>take a quick look at their contacts and if there are people listed there who I have worked with or hung out with&nbsp;or whatever&nbsp;before, I sometimes try to add them if they are somebody I know well or respect a lot or used to date or whatever.</LI></UL>
<P>Now my definition of "worked with" is pretty liberal, since a whole bunch of my work connections boil down to email conversations of issues, most often when people find me rather than me finding them. I guess I figure after 3-4 issues or maybe less if it was something really complex with a bunch of emails.</P>
<P>But recently this backfired, when somebody on another person's&nbsp;list who I added&nbsp;<STRONG>DK'ed</STRONG> me (anyone else remember that one from Oliver Stone's <STRONG>Wall Street</STRONG>?), marked the invite as <STRONG>Doesn't Know</STRONG> and left it at that....</P>
<P><EM>It prompted me look in my email archives --- 4 different issues, 23 different emails between the two of us across those four issues, all related to various internationalization issues and the most recent about six months ago. So it did fit within my "liberal" definitions.</EM></P>
<P>Perhaps my definition is not really passive enough, or maybe it is too liberal. Maybe I need to up the count of mails or the count of issues or limit it to people who I meet in person or have discussed the idea of meeting them in person at some point. It somehow bothers me to be <STRONG>DK'ed</STRONG> by anyone who I would invite -- since it means that others who I respect have much stricter definitions than I).</P>
<P>I guess it does not matter too much -- I log in to <STRONG>facebook</STRONG> every few days and <STRONG>LinkedIn</STRONG> maybe once or twice every few weeks, so they hardly are keeping me glued to my browser looking for new contacts. But passive social networking when you find out you aren't as passive as others is kind of a drag. :-(</P>

Perhaps you should add that to your criteria. (Or Facebook needs to be another option for declining: &quot;Don't remember.&quot;)</p>

<p>Hell, I guess the answer is just not to deal with either of them -- and never add anyone myself (under the &quot;if you don't ask, they can't DK&quot; theory). :-)</p>

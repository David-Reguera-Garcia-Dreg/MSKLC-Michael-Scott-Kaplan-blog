<P>So if you watch television you have probably seen it -- it is one if those freecreditreport.com commercials.</P>
<P>You can watch it <A class="" href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=FspHU8hOxhY" target=_blank mce_href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=FspHU8hOxhY">here</A> or here:</P>

<P mce_keep="true">Now the script for this commercial is quite inspiring:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P mce_keep="true"><FONT face="times new roman,times"><EM>Well I married my dreamgirl<BR>I married my dreamgirl<BR>But she didn’t tell me her credit was bad<BR>So now instead of living in a pleasant suburb<BR>We’re living in the basement at her mom and dad’s<BR>No we can’t get a loan for a respectable home<BR>Just because my girl defaulted on some old credit card<BR>If we had gone to free credit report dot com<BR>I’d be a happy bachelor with a dog and a yard</EM></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P mce_keep="true">And people think that <STRONG>I</STRONG> am cynical about love?</P>
<P mce_keep="true">This guy is sorry he didn't run a credit check on his "dreamgirl" because it kept him away from dumping her, since she&nbsp;is now&nbsp;blocking his happy bachelorhood with his yard and his dog.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">I really hope people aren't quite this lame in the real world....</P>

<p>Advertisers often portray their products as so great that the people in their advertisements will harm/neglect their friends and loved ones in favour of obtaining or using whatever is being sold.</p></div>

<p> ... you know that we don't limit your cynicism to Love ...</p>
<p>but it's part of your charm ... and we love you (anyway) ;~}</p></div>

<P>Now of course I could fantasize about that 'T' standing for Téa Leoni and that she is a [secret] regular reader of this Blog, but of course I know it a much more conventional 'T'. :-)</P></div>

Makes me think of those Geico commercials where the person says they've got good news (usually to someone in trouble) &quot;I just saved a bunch of money on my car insurance&quot;</p>
<p>Now that I think about it, that would be illegal (looking up someone else's credit...)</p></div>

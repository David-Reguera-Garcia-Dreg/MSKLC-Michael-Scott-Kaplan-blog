<P>So it was back in <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/01/29/7297793.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/01/29/7297793.html"><STRONG>Behold the Table Driven Text Service, Part 6 (it is sufficient to be iconic, aka DaYi, DaYi Aynu!)</STRONG></A>&nbsp;when I showed this picture</P>

<P>and was taken to task for not just looking in the resource directory so they could all be the same size.</P>

<P>Somehow this feels worse for some of them (the green color one gets for "transparency" portions in some of them is gone now, for example) and now you can see the ones that were not made to be made bigger like this, and why.</P>
<P>Ah well, I am done playing with the icons, and have no plans to make them any better than this.</P>
<P>I guess I am just not a media icon....</P>
<P>I hope you are not surprised by this.</P>

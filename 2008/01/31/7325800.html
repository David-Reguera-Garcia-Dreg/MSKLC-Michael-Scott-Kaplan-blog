<P>I had somebody send me mail the other day, asking me if I wanted people to send me song lyrics questions&nbsp;like Liz used to (yes, <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/01/01/6921032.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/01/01/6921032.html"><STRONG>that</STRONG></A>&nbsp;Liz&nbsp;-- should I be worried that I almost need to create a Liz blog topic now, and rename it to <STRONG>Sorting Liz all Out</STRONG>?).</P>
<P>Anyway, this reader, she&nbsp;was I think wondering if I was looking for a substitute to help me get past the memory of the person who used to fill the role.</P>
<P>I have to tell you, I actually have probably three dozen different songs that we had talked about in the past that I just haven't had the heart to write about, though when I concentrate&nbsp;I can recall the conversations, hear her voice.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Because it wasn't ever the blogs, it was the&nbsp;chat&nbsp;-- the late night, dynamic conversations that would infuriate and frustrate, yet simultaneously fascinate and captivate me.</P>
<P>I just enjoyed&nbsp;bloggig about the ones that amused me most&nbsp;from time to time, and I know she liked reading them later on....</P>
<P>Could I have the same kind of conversations with someone else? I probably have, or do, or will.</P>
<P>But would they be on the same topics? Probably not.</P>
<P>At the moment I am not even listening to new music, which really sucks given some of what is coming out soon.</P>
<P>And would they be from someone who claimed (when asked) to be morally opposed to time zones and thus unafraid to call someone who was getting the call at 2:00 am? Again, probably not.</P>
<P>I am sure I will find other ways to amuse myself.</P>
<P>And life is likely to be full of fresh tragedies and celebrations in the future.</P>
<P>One day I might try to tackle some of the songs we did talk about, too....</P>
<P>So I don't think I need any lyrics, really. For now I can't even do the ones I have on tap, and I somehow doubt the life/personal circumstances would allow me to synthesize the same kind of relationship again, really. I don't know anyone who was as truly strange as her (well, other than me, I mean).</P>
<P>But it was a very sweet offer, in any case! :-)</P>

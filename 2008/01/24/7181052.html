<P>From the Suggestion Box, a question from SiaO's favorite random reader, Tanveer Badar:</P>

I suspect there won't be anything relevant ever with the ridiculous situation we have.<BR><BR></FONT></EM><EM><FONT face="times new roman,times">The question goes like this:<BR><BR></FONT></EM><EM><FONT face="times new roman,times">"In Pakistan, weekend has shifted back and forth between Friday and Sunday at least half a dozen times. We even had two day long weekend in the 90s. But actually, this would make weekend 2.5 days long because of the half day off on Fridays and holiday on Saturday and Sunday."<BR><BR></FONT></EM><EM><FONT face="times new roman,times">This &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; make any solution problematic for the weekend days and duration because these decisions were made with political agendas and hence the numbers, much more like the updates I have to install twice every year for DST even when Pakistan does not use DST (we tried once to copycat :().</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Remembering the lesson from <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/09/20/471605.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/09/20/471605.html"><STRONG>How many days in a weekend?</STRONG></A> which point out that we do little more than the fractional value</P>

<P>there is not much more than can be done if countries are going to randomly choose to make an already improbable task somewhat impossible by changing the rules so regularly. :-(</P>
<P>Not to mention that&nbsp;the likelihood of me&nbsp;being&nbsp;in Pakistan any time soon is quite scant given how my employer wouldn't send me to India either, and I will be out of vacation time for&nbsp;a bit....</P>
<P>Step one would of course be adding the actual locale data, and as for the constant stream of&nbsp;changes, each Windows version would ship the one in force when Windows shipped amd if they changed more often then we'd just be off a bunch....</P>

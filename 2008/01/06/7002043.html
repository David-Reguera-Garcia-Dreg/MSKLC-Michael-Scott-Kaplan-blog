<P>I guess we all (finally!) know how important collation is if&nbsp;presidential&nbsp;candidates&nbsp;are talking about it (ref: <A class="" href="http://www.seattlepixel.com/2007/11/barack-obama-on-sorting-algorithms.html" mce_href="http://www.seattlepixel.com/2007/11/barack-obama-on-sorting-algorithms.html">Barack Obama on Sorting Algorithms</A>):</P>

<P>See the post for the context by which&nbsp;he can be pinned down on a sorting issue!</P>
<P>I found myself quite impressed for the fact that the answer was intelligent and accurate, if underwhelming technically&nbsp;(so perhaps not for a developer job, but&nbsp;we&nbsp;seem to have many such people underfoot!).</P>

<p>&quot;Clinton has been pushing Quicksort as the answer to everything. But people who want the quick answers to all the complicated problems will find they pay a heavy price. Does she realize that quicksort has *quadratic complexity* in the worst-case?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Barack Obama is pulling the wool over the voter's eyes. His &quot;Shell sort&quot; is nothing but a shell-game, that will leave the American voter wondering where the stability of their old order went.&quot;</p>
<p>I'd definitely put my money on massively parallel solutions. A thousand points of computation!</p></div>
<p><strong>Chen</strong> on 25 Oct 2008 12:58 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Must admit I have no idea what the question regarding the 32 bit thingamajig means nor what the answer implies. I did google it up but gave up after I had to google 3 more words in the definition I was given. This is all the more sad when u realize I work for a large software company and have written a few emails with subjects that included "32 bit/ 64 bit encryption", lucky for them I'm not a developer.</p>
<p>However I have to say I'm very pleased to hear the next POTUS is smarter then me. </p>
<p>I can only assume that if Bush was asked the same question his answer would have consisted of a long pause accompanied by a dumb look for about 5-7 minutes.</p></div>

<P>The exact words:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><EM>I apologize for being so shameless.</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>She was subsequently assured that she had nothing to be ashamed of, since casual subconscious flirting between people slightly bored by their surroundings who would never take it any further given the&nbsp;genuine lack of means, motive, and opportunity does not now and would not ever constitute a reason to feel such a thing.</P>
<P>A smile proved this assuaged the shame. :-)</P>
<P>It&nbsp;seemed flattering, nevertheless....</P>
<P>But then maybe I need to get out more, Or stay in&nbsp;more. Or whatever.</P>
<P>The ears of <STRONG>SiaO</STRONG> are open, and one never knows what might be overheard....</P>
<P mce_keep="true">&nbsp;</P>
<P><EM><FONT color=#ff00ff>The various characters in Unicode are ashamed at even the implied sponsorship caused by letters being used to represent the words in this post</FONT></EM></P>

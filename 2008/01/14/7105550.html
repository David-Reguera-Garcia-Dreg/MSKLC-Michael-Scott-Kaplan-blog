<P>And playing on the stereo now is the last track on Aimee Mann's <STRONG>Lost in Space</STRONG> (It's Not):</P>

<P>I remember being backstage at the Moore once a few years back at a meet and greet with a bunch of fans and&nbsp;Aimee,&nbsp;and I mentioned that this was one of those songs that I wished could keep going on and on with new verses exploring the same theme (all before the last verse, of course). She looked almost pained when I said it, which makes sense given how this song does push the vocal range a bit. </P>
<P>Maybe that's intentional -- really deep songs aren't supposed to be easy. This is not a song I would ever do in Karaoke or anything, so I know where she's&nbsp;coming from.</P>
<P>Later I told John Stewart (no, not the Daily Show guy) about&nbsp;my suggestion&nbsp;and he just looked at me and just shook his head. Chutzpah, it is.</P>
<P>Anyhow, the reason for all of this introspection? My friend Liz who <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/01/01/6921032.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/01/01/6921032.html">I spent New Years Eve with</A>&nbsp;passed away the other day, not nearly as far into her "itinerary" as she wanted to be, something that will probably&nbsp;haunt me for some time&nbsp;to come. I had some rough moments&nbsp;and I actually decided not to blog about it until after I had passed through enough to fake it with people. And I am past some of it, and this post will sit up there on the server for a few days so I have plenty of time to take it down if I change my mind.</P>
<P>I wasn't at the funeral. Would&nbsp;being there&nbsp;have given me closure?</P>
<P>Probably not, I already said farewell as best as I ever could have.</P>
<P>I have actually tried to write a fourth verse to the song&nbsp;twice now since I started writing this post and stopped each time when I felt myself starting to almost tear up. Maybe I am in denial about something. </P>
<P>Hang on, the phone is ringing.</P>
<P>Okay, I'm back. I was&nbsp;about to say&nbsp;the person calling&nbsp;was doing it awfully late, though actually it is only 11pm on a Friday, and she will probably be going out later, still. I must really be getting old, but I kind of decided I was in for the night and wasn't even tempted to change my mind when someone tried tempt me. Perhaps I should rethink that a bit. No sense sitting here by myself....</P>
<P>But either way, I did manage to make it through the verse, in my head. Let's try to commit it to blog:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><EM>Though&nbsp;I kept looking in her eyes&nbsp;as I&nbsp;searched for answers<BR>going through motions although I really can't say why<BR>could I have tried harder,&nbsp;or&nbsp;done something different?<BR>it wouldn't feel&nbsp;any easier to say goodbye.<BR>and I can't close my eyes and pretend she's still there<BR>'cause&nbsp;she's not.<BR>I know&nbsp;she's not.<BR>no she's not.</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The scansion is a bit off, maybe I'll tweak it later....</P>
<P>I think I took six months off my life writing that (by the time I was done with it).</P>
<P>On the other hand, I think I may have added a year to my life reading it and singing it to myself&nbsp;(by the time I was done with <EM>that</EM>).</P>
<P>And I imagine I'll still be faking it for a while to come. Because&nbsp;I feel like one of the best&nbsp;parts of me, a part that I took for granted and just assumed would always be there,&nbsp;is&nbsp;gone now....</P>

<p>PS. &nbsp;In your original post, you wrote:</p>
<p>&quot;a PNL (Perfectly Normal Liz), the secret inspiration for normaliz.dll in Windows.&quot; Out of curiousity, I searched my hard drive for this file, named in honor of your friend. The closest I could find is a Unicode-related .dll file named &quot;normalization.dll&quot; (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://support.microsoft.com/dllhelp/default.aspx?l=55&amp;fid=210994">http://support.microsoft.com/dllhelp/default.aspx?l=55&amp;fid=210994</a>).</p>
<p>I think that you should demand that whomever renamed this file restore it's original name.</p></div>

I never know (Liz was the one that song 'One Week' was written for, as she was the type to laugh at a funeral and so on -- so she is my example of embracing having no idea what to say)....</p>
<p>But thank you very much for the kind words; since I am generally not the type to laugh at funerals even if the deceased would have wanted it, genuine sympathy goes a long way with me. :-)</p>

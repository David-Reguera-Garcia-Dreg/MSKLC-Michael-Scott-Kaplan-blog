<P>Just a little update on the spam situation here at <A class="" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap">SiaO</A>.</P>
<P>I am overriding the default site spam scores with the score for flagging comments for moderation at <STRONG>5</STRONG> and the score for automatically deleting comments suspected to be spam at <STRONG>12</STRONG>. These two settings lead to probably a 12-15 <STRONG>possible spam comments/pingbacks</STRONG> to review (with about a 1% overall false positive rate) and between approximately&nbsp;2450 and 5050 comments flagged as <STRONG>spam</STRONG> (after a one week review period of every single one of them, I have stopped reviewing those flagged as actual&nbsp;spam with the solitary exception of trackbacks I know of because they come from other posts of mine).</P>
<P>Currently most pingback splog spam is filtered out, except for a few core splog crap sites&nbsp;that for now I simply delete by hand when I see them.</P>
<P>As of midnight (seven hours and one minute before this blog went live), the active filtered spam count was <STRONG>3587</STRONG>, with approximately <STRONG>64%</STRONG> single word comments with links to spam sites and <STRONG>36%</STRONG> with links within the comment text as well.</P>
<P>Initial&nbsp;investigation, attempting to categorize the nature of the spam (pornography vs. male enhancement vs. female enhancement vs. erectile dysfunction pharmaceuticals vs.other pharmaceuticals vs. Rolexes vs. other random crap and so on was abandoned due to moral despair.</P>
<P>With my upcoming trip I guess what will suffer most is:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the anonymous comments which might go longer before I see them to approve them, and</LI>
<LI>the pingback spam from splog sites that the spam filters don't catch not being deleted</LI></UL>
<P>So sorry in advance for the troubles there. Though with as much spam being caught, I think readers are able to avoid the bulk of&nbsp;the <EM>real</EM> worries&nbsp;(if it bothers you, consider registering on the site!).</P>

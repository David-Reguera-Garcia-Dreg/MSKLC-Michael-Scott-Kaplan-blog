<P>Sometimes it really pays to have ears, I tell you.</P>
<P>Now she is young, and maybe he is, too. Maybe not, I can't tell for sure. He looks young, but then so do I and I don't feel young at all.</P>
<P>Anyway, just bits and pieces overheard:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=4>It's okay if&nbsp;I jump you unintentionally.<BR>But intentionally seems wrong.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Of course I'm sure some of this would be a lot more fun if I had the context. This one is just oozing with pragmatic content....</P>
<P>And then the same couple, a few minutes later:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=4>I&nbsp;don't want you to leave me, or to run away, or to push me away<BR>But&nbsp;I want you to stop loving me,&nbsp;I think.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Both quotes were things things she was saying; he seemed kind of quiet.</P>
<P>Though I have trouble blaming him&nbsp;-- Bob only knows what I'd say.</P>
<P>Gentle readers, youth really <STRONG>is</STRONG> wasted on the young....</P>

<p>Of course Unicode wouldn't have been able to do it alone. It still needs someone as Michael. Today is not the day of the rising of the machines. Yet.</p></div>

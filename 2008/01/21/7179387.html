<P>A follow-up on that <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/01/14/7104170.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/01/14/7104170.html"><STRONG>Hello! I am bored this afternoon. I am a nice Blog that would like to blog with you....</STRONG></A> post from a week ago. :-)</P>
<P>Spam at SIAO has been decreasing all week -- with the current count of messages assumed to be spam as of midnight at <STRONG>1458</STRONG>.</P>
<P>That's right.</P>
<P><FONT size=6>1,443</FONT></P>
<P>That is&nbsp;an all-time low for SIAO since I started watching the spam, and an almost 250% drop since that initial report last week! </P>
<P>Now&nbsp;since I did nothing special to make it happen, I can only assume that it is either </P>
<P>A) a temporary fluke with spam levels expected to be up again soon, or </P>
<P>B)&nbsp;a significant number&nbsp;of the actual spammers noticing that their messages aren't getting though, which made them decide to stop wasting everyone's time</P>
<P>I would love to imagine that it is (B) but it is most likely (A). But I'll be back in a week or so to update everyone on the progress....</P>
<P>One thing I am going to try for while I am in the air flying to India&nbsp;-- I am going to try to disable all trackbacks/pingbacks and then re-enable them when I have access to the blog again. This is an experiment, though the worst that can happen should be nothing, so it seems like a safe risk....</P>

<P>As readers here know, I mostly spent the holidays alone this year.</P>
<P>Somewhere between my vacation I had to take (or lose), my feeling like I wanted a little solitude, and the infection related MS exacerbation that popped up, I ended up begging off just about any plans or parties that I was invited to.</P>
<P>One thing that a bunch of my friends did as part of a concerted effort to make sure that I knew people were thinking about me was a massive group-led present, which was basically a set of Accoutrements action figures, shown in the picture below spread out over a bed:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/accoutrements01.png"></P>
<P><FONT size=1>The gang from left to right:<BR></FONT><FONT size=1><STRONG>First row</STRONG>: Johann Sebastian Bach, Carl Jung, Charles Dickens, Jane Austen, Ludwig Van Beethoven, William Shakespeare<BR></FONT><FONT size=1><STRONG>Second row</STRONG>: Benjamin Franklin, Vincent Van Gogh, Edgar Allen Poe, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Marie Antoinette, Sigmund Freud<BR></FONT><FONT size=1><STRONG>Third row</STRONG>: Oscar Wilde</FONT></P>
<P>Many of them are posable and come with props and quotes and more.</P>
<P>Now the coordination was not perfect a I did end up with two Bachs and two Austens, if people are interested they&nbsp;can pop by and ask. :-)</P>
<P>I wasn't specifically depressed or anything, but had I been this would have hit the spot, for sure.</P>
<P>It definitely put me in a very good mood, in any case.</P>
<P>And when Annette called and asked me whether I enjoyed the "gift" -- these fifteen deliveries -- I got to use that title line quote: <STRONG>Baby, you had me at Oscar Wilde....</STRONG></P>
<P>Awesome!</P>

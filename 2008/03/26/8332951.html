<P>You may recall when I blogged <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/12/02/1198134.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/12/02/1198134.html"><STRONG>'It's an iBOT,' I would say. 'Yes you bought it, but what is it?' she would answer</STRONG></A>, the Colbert Report interview of Dean Kamen talking about the IBOT (sorry that the video is no longer available, that's a youtube thing, its not me).</P>
<P>Anyway, Dean was back on the show last week to talk about his water purifier, you can see the interview <A class="" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os9RcFehGX4" target=_blank mce_href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os9RcFehGX4">here</A>, <A class="" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5FKtvxU7c0" target=_blank mce_href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5FKtvxU7c0">here</A>, or <A class="" href="http://gizmodo.com/370698/colbert-first-vid-of-dean-kamens-miracle-water-distiller" mce_href="http://gizmodo.com/370698/colbert-first-vid-of-dean-kamens-miracle-water-distiller">here</A> perhaps (look fast before they disappear, I guess?). The unit is pretty interesting it is a much cleaner looking version of a project he first talked about maybe five years ago, described in his Wikipedia article, <A class="" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Kamen#Inventions" mce_href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Kamen#Inventions">here</A>:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><EM><FONT face="times new roman,times">Kamen has worked extensively on a project involving Stirling engine designs, attempting to create a machine that would generate power while serving as a water purification system. He hopes the project will help improve living standards in developing countries.</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>It is staggering, and&nbsp;more than a little bit inspiring,&nbsp;to see people like Dean really trying their hardest to help solve problems like this.</P>
<P><EM>Which reminds me -- sorry hon (you know who you are, dear!), though&nbsp;Dean is still single, he </EM><A class="" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Kamen#Personal_life" mce_href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Kamen#Personal_life"><EM>is married to his inventions</EM></A><EM>. Maybe he would be willing to have dinner, though. He could pick you up in his helicopter.</EM> :-)</P>
<P>My appeal for the IBOT (ref: <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/01/20/7177837.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/01/20/7177837.html"><STRONG>NOT MEDICALLY NECESSARY per, by their own description, non-medical people</STRONG></A>), is proceeding, and I now know of some people who have succeeded so I am feeling more and more hopeful about the process and an eventual good result. I'll post more about this soon. I have had an additional opportunity to try the IBOT out and for home, work, shopping, and traveling, it is looking more and more like a very powerful life enabler....</P>
<P>In other news, another great meal one can make with the help of San Pellegrino Limonata -- Limonata and Honey Nut Cheerios! </P>
<P>If this grosses you out, then try to stay strong. This was (while not as good as <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/11/09/6003541.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/11/09/6003541.html"><STRONG>Limonata and Chrunch Berries</STRONG></A>), quite tasty!!!</P>

<P>Perhaps you have been to Microsoft's <STRONG><FONT color=#cc6600>Global Dev</FONT>elopment and Computing Portal</STRONG> at <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/default.mspx">http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/default.mspx</A>&nbsp;at some time in the past (if you are a regular reader it may have even been due to as post of mine!).</P>
<P>Well, that site has not been updated in quite some time (as a point of reference, it lists the fact that Dr. International now has a blog as a top story. It has been showing its age!</P>
<P>But now there is a&nbsp;new site, right off of MSDN. Just go to that main page:</P>
<P><IMG height=667 src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/goglobal01.png" width=1042><A href="http://www.trigeminal.com/images/goglobal01.png"></A></P>
<P>and look at the Developer Centers in the lower left hand corner where is says <STRONG>More...</STRONG> and click there.</P>
<P>You will get to this page:</P>
<P><IMG height=1200 src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/goglobal02.png" width=1042></P>
<P>This time if you look under <STRONG>Win32 and COM Development</STRONG>, you will see it.</P>
<P><STRONG>Go Global!</STRONG></P>
<P>Let's take a look!</P>
<P>Here it is, right at <A href="http://msdn2.microsof.com/goglobal">http://msdn2.microsof.com/goglobal</A> also known as the <STRONG>Go Global Developer Center</STRONG>:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/goglobal03.png"></P>
<P>Articles and other resources, blogs<FONT size=1><SUP>1</SUP></FONT>, useful links everywhere -- very cool!</P>
<P>One of the most interesting points is that even though it has not yet really been announced anywhere externally in any official capacity<SUP><FONT size=1>2</FONT></SUP>, the fact that it can be reached via navigation as described above has led to it having what has been reported as a fairly impressive hit count in terms of direct non-referred hits!</P>
<P>Check it out today, the <STRONG><FONT color=#ff6600>Go Global</FONT> Developer Center</STRONG> at <A href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/goglobal/">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/goglobal/</A>&nbsp;!!!</P>

<p>It would be nice to (at least) have a link at the top of the old GlobaDev pointing to this new portal (or whatever it is).</p></div>

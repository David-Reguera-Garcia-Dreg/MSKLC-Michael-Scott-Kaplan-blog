<P>One never knows what one is going to overhear, does one? :-)</P>
<P><EM>Maybe "Overheard" needs its own category. These are fun!</EM></P>
<P>Anyway, it went something like this:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times"><FONT size=3><STRONG>HIM</STRONG>: That girl in the background of the picture, she's cute.<BR><STRONG>HER</STRONG>: She's awesome... a very unique woman, never met anyone&nbsp;else like her.&nbsp;<BR><STRONG>HIM</STRONG>: <FONT size=2><EM>{nothing said. he just looked quite interested in what she had to say}</EM></FONT><BR><STRONG>HER</STRONG>: We have similar temperaments, like to sleep lots and do the same stuff.&nbsp;A very unique woman.&nbsp;She is really cute though. If&nbsp;I were a guy....<BR><EM><STRONG><FONT color=#ff0000 size=2>[Pause for a "Joey Tribbiani" moment here to imagine what&nbsp;SHE meant here; HE didn't pause, though]</FONT></STRONG><BR></EM><STRONG>HIM</STRONG>: Maybe you should introduce us?<BR><STRONG>HER</STRONG>: Sure, she may come here to visit, soonish. <BR><STRONG>HIM</STRONG>: Great!<BR><STRONG>HER</STRONG>: But this is a terrible way to let me know you're not interested in me.</FONT></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This is the kind of interaction that would almost definitely be ruined by knowing the context. </P>
<P>A full understanding of&nbsp;<STRONG>HIM</STRONG> and/or&nbsp;<STRONG>HER</STRONG> and/or&nbsp;<STRONG>THE PICTURE</STRONG>&nbsp;and/or&nbsp;<STRONG>THE GIRL IN THE PICTURE</STRONG>&nbsp;is almost guaranteed to be less interesting than what one could fill in with a bit of imagination, don't you think? :-)</P>
<P>If you happen to be&nbsp;<STRONG>HIM</STRONG> or&nbsp;<STRONG>HER</STRONG> or <STRONG>THE GIRL IN THE PICTURE</STRONG>&nbsp;(in the admittedly unlikely case that&nbsp;any of you are regular readers of this Blog -- my readership within the Seattle metro area is hardly large enough to make this terribly probable!), you of course are allowed to comment, though please help keep some of the mystery alive so that we can all live vicariously through the&nbsp;three of you and your interesting potential triangle....</P>

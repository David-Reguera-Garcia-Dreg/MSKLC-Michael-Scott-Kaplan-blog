This is one of those times.&nbsp;Thus, while&nbsp;c</FONT></EM><EM><FONT color=#ff0000 size=1>omments are not disabled in this post,&nbsp;they are strongly discouraged....</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM>Apologies for the X-Files allusion in the title, as softened by the accompanying eroteme.</EM></P>
<P>The question about blogging about matters so closely tied to my&nbsp;work when my employer (or at least my management) wants it to be made crystal clear that this is a <STRONG>personal</STRONG> blog&nbsp;has&nbsp;become&nbsp;an interesting one, to me.</P>
<P>Yet if I only posted about personal stuff, then people might find hosting it on blogs.msdn.com might be inappropriate. </P>
<P>So clearly by some metric this blog <STRONG>is</STRONG> about my work and my job, even though the people who manage my job&nbsp;are denying me three times and all that.</P>
<P>Which is not to suggest that I am anyone's Jesus or anything; you know what I mean.</P>
<P>But in the aftermath of what happened and what is, I am left wondering what this blog really should be.</P>
<P>Or even whether it should be anything, while it sits on this server and while I sit where I do, job wise.</P>
<P>I have been largely coasting for the last few months on existing items I said I'd talk about and such, but without a real sense of direction.</P>
<P>Avoiding the question.</P>
<P>I could just say I miss Liz and leave it at that, but this isn't about her. </P>
<P>Well, not really about her, at least.</P>
<P>But once upon a time she did provide something of a passive compass for me that I only sometimes consulted but always knew was there, and&nbsp;I admit I'm having trouble figuring out where North is at the moment, without that compass.</P>
<P>Though I can't truthfully claim to be&nbsp;unhappy. In fact, I&nbsp;am not unhappy.</P>
<P>Professionally speaking I have been rather&nbsp;pleased and happy to find that even though my management (in a burst of <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/01/15/7103490.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/01/15/7103490.html"><STRONG>wankitude/wingnuttery</STRONG></A> that I could calculate&nbsp;if my slide rule was not in storage in a box in Philadelphia) doesn't appreciate me, that a lot of other people and groups do -- it keeps me feeling good about Microsoft, at least. And of&nbsp;a lot&nbsp;of the people and groups in it. And I do believe on the work that happens in the group&nbsp;and in the building.</P>
<P>And&nbsp;I believe in a lot of other things too.</P>
<P>I could likely keep coasting with the&nbsp;blog posting&nbsp;for a while, as that huge&nbsp;mound-o-things on&nbsp;my To-Do list is still there. With probably a dozen written posts and&nbsp;twice as&nbsp;many half written, and then with&nbsp;three or&nbsp;four&nbsp;times as many that are almost fully composed in my head and all&nbsp;I have to do is dictate them and thereby insert the expected typos/speechos.</P>
<P>Though there is no rule that says that all of them, or even any of them,&nbsp;have to be posted.</P>
<P>When I think about how the Blog is aimlessly wandering without a theme, while each blog continues to have some point, I wonder. Do people&nbsp;notice that lack of overall direction as opposed to the original slowly changing overall direction, all in a see of for the most part directed slices of time?</P>
<P>The quote that pops into my mind: <EM><STRONG>The assassin's gun may believe it is the surgeon's scalpel, but the assassin must know the task.</STRONG></EM></P>
<P>At the moment I am unsure. Not discontent with life, but perhaps a bit discontent with all of this. At the moment.</P>
<P>So&nbsp;I am left wondering -- what if I stopped blogging? </P>
<P>The 20 people who read regularly read would notice right away (adjusted for the fact that this is posted on a weekend), the regular but busy folk/the&nbsp;in-love ones/others more casual would notice within a week or three, and it might make for a great WEHT blog that someone else could write in a year or so, after looking into whatever did happen. Nothing would actually "happen" though, in the end.</P>
<P>That persona would be gone, and people who missed it would have to seek out me and a less passive type of connection than the blog enables for them. A terrible loss, for some.</P>
<P>And&nbsp;I might miss it, too. My soapbox and my pronouncements from on low.&nbsp;I could imagine missing that, some at least.</P>
<P>If the existing other unpublished posts never went live? Not that much of a difference, really -- perhaps the difference between the Blog being hit by a bus and the Blog passing on after a long illness.</P>
<P>I&nbsp;am reminded of&nbsp;how I miss Suzanne E. McCarthy's <A class="" href="http://abecedaria.blogspot.com/" mce_href="http://abecedaria.blogspot.com/">Abecedaria</A>, which is now approaching its second anniversary of not being posted to. We miss them when they disappear, whether with bang or whimper, knowing the people&nbsp;might still be alive, just no longer in our lives, right? With the blog just sitting, dormant -- a testament to the disappearance without corresponding backstory.</P>
<P>What if&nbsp;SiaO&nbsp;just stopped? Like with no warning or indication, perhaps&nbsp;even in mid-</P>

<p>&quot;As is probably obvious to readers of this blog, I’ve long since given up any idea that this blog will be focused on any one topic, or that all the topics will be of interest to anybody but myself: I’m always glad when somebody finds something here of interest, but the reason why I keep on writing is to help focus my thoughts (e.g. via posts like this one!) on whatever happens to be on my mind at any given time.&quot;</p>
<p>Does that help any?</p></div>

<p>The more personal posts are interesting as they show your personality - accusations of Raymond Chen being a robot come to mind (I don't think you have to worry about that ;) ).</p>
<p>In short, if you move then I'll follow. But I'd much prefer you don't stop completely.</p></div>

<p>(I'm afraid I found the rest of your post a bit too self-indulgent for my tastes.

<p> There is a reason for that NOTE text at the top -- I was tempted to not allow comments as I was not trying to create a huge &quot;we need you, please stay!&quot; thread, as my reasons for leaving aren't really such that they could be influenced by that kind of thing.</p>

<P>I can't say that I blame MS management for their positions, it both helps to remove liability from them, and also allows the authors more freedom than one would think off hand.</P>
<P>Its better to stop blogging now while you can still claim you don't dislike it. Waiting will only end up making you dislike it, which may prevent you from picking it up again at a later point.</P></div>

<p>You know I do enjoy your blog, personal or not.</p>
<p>I think that questioning your blogging and asking if it is personal or not is also questioning the whole Microsoft policy to open-up and allow blogging to begin with.</p>
<p>There is no doubt for me that this whole movement did god to the MS PR, on one side, and greatly benefited the community on the other side.</p>
<p>The main message from reading you blog, or Raimond Chen, or Shawn Steele, or others, is that things in MS products have in most cases a good reason to be as they are. Or had a good reason when they where designed. And that people care, and they are trying hard to do the right thing.</p>
<p>Going beyond the 20 regulars (or 15, or 50, it does not matter), your blog is sent used countless times as an answer to someone's question. Solves a problem. The doc is not always enough, or up to date, or even present. So if one of your posts helps someone solve a problem, official or not, is doing a good thing.</p>
<p>It was nice while it lasted, with blogs, CTPs, very public betas. But it looks like MS is starting to close-up again. Too bad.</p></div>

Both because I find the technical matters of internationalisation, localisation and encoding very interesting, and because it is personal. I do the same, my blog has both technical matters (and I linked you more than a couple of time btw ;) ) and personal stuff.</p>
<p>I did decide about two years ago that I wanted not to be taken for a Gentoo-only kind of guy (Gentoo Linux is where I contribute the most) and replaced my blog, that was before on Gentoo infrastructure, with a personal one I host myself (first at home, now on a vserver). I blogged more freely since then. Lately I've started dividing posts into categories as many people were interested only in the technical matters... I don't really like those readers too much, but I suppose I'll have to live with them, so I leave them an opt out way to ignore my personal posts, which is _not_ the default.</p>
<p>Maybe you could consider this a bit, I sincerely think it would be a lost not only for Microsoft-based developers, but the development community as a whole, to lose both the experience and the personality of such a dedicated individual in the field of internationalisation.</p></div>

I don't get the leap from there to a lack of support from your management.</p>
<p>Comparing to Raymond, who I think keeps a more observational tone in his Windows posts, I like your attutude which shows more personality in your discussion of issues and even problems in Microsoft technologies. The fact that you're invested comes through and yet no attitude about Microsoft. I'm not even saying you're loyal, you just recognize Microsoft for what it is, a large company with a lot of people in it -- they may make mistakes but there are no sinister agendas. </p></div>

<P>From the Suggestion Box, Dawn asked:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times"><EM>I am stumped. <BR><BR>I appear to have some type of autocorrect changing ampersand signs in a report header title, even though I have switched off all autocorrect functions. <BR><BR>I have tried quotes around the entire title, quotes around the ampersand, spaces around the ampersand. <BR><BR>Your knowledge base does not contain anything on ampersands nor symbol corrections. </EM></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Well, I think this might be a Microsoft Access question....</P>
<P>If I am wrong then ignore the answer, unless you are Dawn, in which case you should give more detail! :-)</P>
<P>If you look in a form (I know the question is about a report, I'll get there in a moment!), and start typing in&nbsp;a label, including an ampersand, it looks fine:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/Ampersand01.png"></P>
<P>and then when you get out of edit mode, it changes:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/Ampersand02.png"></P>
<P>Suddenly instead of <STRONG>Foo &amp; Bar</STRONG>, it has become <STRONG>Foo _Bar</STRONG>.</P>
<P>Huh?</P>
<P>Well, the ampersand is the way that you add a keyboard accelerator, so you can type the ALT key plus the next character when the form is in browse.</P>
<P>In this case, the accelerator is on the space, which would be weird. But this behavior will&nbsp;always&nbsp;happen.</P>
<P>The workaround? Type two ampersands:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/Ampersand03.png"></P>
<P>and then when you commit, you will be all set:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/Ampersand04.png"></P>
<P>Now logically none of this should apply to reports, since all reports in Access &lt;= 2003 never have live accelerators in browse mode.</P>
<P>So none of this should have anything to do with Dawn's problem.</P>
<P>That would just be dumb, right?</P>
<P>Well...</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/Ampersand05.png"></P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/Ampersand06.png"></P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/Ampersand07.png"></P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/Ampersand08.png"></P>
<P>I won't say a word.</P>
<P>Even&nbsp;though I think&nbsp;<STRONG>Smart Quotes</STRONG> and <STRONG>AutoCorrect</STRONG> are smarter than this behavior. :-(</P>
<P>Dawn, was that it? Or are we talking about something else?</P>

<p><strong>Robert MacLean</strong> on 20 Mar 2008 3:33 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Oh, and it isn't only an Access thing. I knew the answer cause Delphi did the same. I think VB 6.0 did it too.</p></div>
<p><strong>pcooper</strong> on 20 Mar 2008 9:41 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>VB 6 definitely does it, although there's a UseMnemonic property on labels which lets you turn off the behavior. (Not that one would ever think to look there if one is wondering why ampersands disappear.) I don't know if Access has something similar somewhere.</p></div>
<p><strong>Programmerman</strong> on 20 Mar 2008 11:06 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>It still applies to MFC code. &nbsp;Not that I ever use that anymore... took me half an hour to dig up some functional MFC code to test with. &nbsp;Long live .net!</p></div>
<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 20 Mar 2008 11:12 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>I do agree it is widely used functionality, but how many of those clients have a &quot;report title&quot; that someone would name and assume that it would be understood, which also happened to be a bad implementation of the feature? :-)</p>
<p>I think Access would be the main one of these (I doubt Crystal Reports would have the same problem, though I could be mistaken on that).</p>

<P><EM><FONT color=#ff0000>This post has nothing to do with any&nbsp;issue in the Middle East whatsoever. I suppose I have </FONT></EM><EM><FONT color=#ff0000>an opinion or two about that but it is unlikely to be a topic in this blog any time soon....</FONT></EM></P>
<P>The whole <STRONG>using lyrics from a Neil Diamond/Jazz Singer song</STRONG> is a bit of a stretch, sorry. But I just had to get myself taken off a list talking about [Biblical ]Hebrew support in computers that turned out to be really really keen on the active proselytization of Jews (something I always thought many or perhaps most Christian churches oppose, to various degrees), and The Jazz Singer was on cable, and this question came up related to Hebrew, and everything just seemed to intersect.</P>
<P>I would likely have done better had Neil Diamond given me more to work with, but then I guess I usually feel that way when I think about The Jazz Singer.</P>
<P>But I digress.... :-)</P>
<P>Back on the 13th of this month over in the Microsoft Volt users community, aldinois asked:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times">is windows vista ultimate the only vista where i can use hebrew?</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Now maybe it is just me but that takes me way back, all the way to <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/03/30/404007.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/03/30/404007.html"><STRONG>Even every version of XP Home is fully internationalized....</STRONG></A>, in fact!</P>
<P>Because Hebrew will work on any version/SKU of Vista without even the need to enable complex script support, with only two caveats:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Hebrew as a UI language (i.e. MUI support) requires Ultimate or Enterprise, and</LI>
<LI>Microsoft Office behavior with Hebrew may be less than ideal if you do not enable support for Hebrew in their Language Settings tool.</LI></OL>
<P>But other that, <FONT size=4>עברית</FONT> (Hebrew) will work just fine in any kind of Vista you can throw at it. Uniscribe is on, the fonts and keyboards are there, and everything is ready to go!</P>

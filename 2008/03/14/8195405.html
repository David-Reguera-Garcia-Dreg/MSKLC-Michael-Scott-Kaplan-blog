<P>I was scooting to the store last night and I had my Zune playing in "shuffle" mode, so the songs would&nbsp;be randomly selected from the playlist.</P>
<P>And this wasn't just any playlist. This was my <STRONG>NotJustAngryFemaleSingerSongwriters</STRONG> playlist. There are like at least 500 songs on this list, from anywhere. From everywhere.</P>
<P>The result was the following&nbsp;thirteen songs playing, consecutively:</P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Worn Me Down</STRONG> (Rachel Yamagata, from <EM>Happenstance</EM>) -- <FONT size=1>She is watching him breaking up with another woman yet again, but she can't keep comforting him so he can go find someone else that she will inevitably be jealous of</FONT>.</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Umbrella</STRONG> (Dog's Eye View, from <EM>Daisy</EM>) -- <FONT size=1>He likes her but she isn't noticing, or maybe she isn't interested. But he still loves her anyway</FONT>.</LI>
<LI><STRONG>I Know There's a Word</STRONG> (Aimee Mann, from <EM>Whatever</EM>) -- <FONT size=1>She thinks she is starting to fall in love with him, but is trying to avoid&nbsp;saying the words&nbsp;because she knows that if saying them is hard that&nbsp;living them&nbsp;is just going to be harder.</FONT></LI>
<LI><STRONG>She's So High</STRONG> (Tal Bachman, from <EM>Tal Bachman</EM>) -- <FONT size=1>He is smitten by and feeling completely unworthy of her, and even though she is approaching him now he does not know what to do now</FONT>.</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Would You...?</STRONG> (Touch &amp; Go, from <EM>I Find You Very Attractive</EM>) -- <FONT size=1>She likes him, she is nervously trying to tell him. And&nbsp;is trying to get&nbsp;up the nerve to ask&nbsp;asks him "Would you go to bed with me?" but she may not have actually told him out loud...</FONT>.</LI>
<LI><STRONG>For You I Will</STRONG> (Teddy Geiger, <EM>Underaged Thinking</EM>) -- <FONT size=1>He wants to tell her how she feels, and this time he has confidence that is going to do it</FONT>.</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Why Can't I</STRONG> (Liz Phair, from <EM>Liz Phair</EM>) -- <FONT size=1>She's involved with someone else, so is he. Yet they are irresistibly drawn to each other and they know it can't be avoided</FONT>.</LI>
<LI><STRONG>This Kiss</STRONG> (Faith Hill, from <EM>Faith</EM>) -- <FONT size=1>She doesn't want to do it because she hates the feeling when it's over, but when he kisses her she knows kissing him back is the only thing she can do</FONT>.</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Today</STRONG> (Jefferson Airplane, from <EM>Surrealistic Pillow</EM>) -- <FONT size=1>They both feel like it is love, it is getting stronger each day</FONT>.</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Built This Way</STRONG> (Samantha Ronson, from <EM>Mean Girls Soundtrack</EM>) -- <FONT size=1>She realizes that she doesn't feel the same way he does. Maybe she is built this way, because he blames her just like all the guys before have. All she can do is start over and try again</FONT>.</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Linger</STRONG> (The Cranberries, from <EM>Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We</EM>) -- <FONT size=1>She still loves him even though he is playing the field now. He still has her heart, but she doesn't have his</FONT>.</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Daisychains</STRONG> (Youth Group, from <EM>Casino Twilight Dogs</EM>) -- <FONT size=1>He is alone now, it is what he asked for when he asked her to leave. But now that she is gone, he misses her</FONT>.</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Murder She Wrote</STRONG> (Chaka Demus &amp; Pliers, from <EM>Tease Me</EM>) -- <FONT size=1>Her beauty may be a bunch of rose, but behind that pretty face is&nbsp;a flirty girl with bad character who runs Tom, Dick, and also Harry. He needs to stay away</FONT>.</LI></UL>
<P>At this point. having watched an entire fictional&nbsp;relationship move from friendship to infatuation to sex to love to realization that it was just infatuation to infidelity to heartbreak to one person thinking the other is&nbsp;completely manipulative, there was only one thing to do.</P>
<P>Turn off the shuffle feature and remember to never, <STRONG>ever</STRONG> turn it on again.</P>
<P>Ever.</P>

<hr/><p><strong>Arun Philip</strong> on 14 Mar 2008 6:16 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Now why do I get the feeling that I've run through one of those relationships? Except that &quot;She still loves him even though he is playing the field now. He still has her heart, but she doesn't have his&quot; was the other way round. </p>
<p>I predict this comment will be followed by N number of similar comments :) </p></div>

<p>I remarked to a friend of mine that trying to not hvae my life so closedly represent various songs by either The Cranberries in general or Dolores O'Riordan in particular -- precisely for the reason you mention! :-)</p>

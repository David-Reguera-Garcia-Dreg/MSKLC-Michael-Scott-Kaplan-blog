<P>The other day I popped by Yaniv's office to ask him a question (I will be blogging about the fruits of that conversation another day) and while I was there he gave me a copy he had of an instruction manual.</P>
<P>It was for&nbsp;a HID&nbsp;(High Intensity Discharge) Xenon&nbsp;headlight, and it had an interesting sentence in the instructions.</P>
<P>Now the whole manual was full of difficult to parse English, don't misunderstand me on <EM>that</EM> point.</P>
<P>There are wrong word choices, odd word choices,&nbsp;unusual word order issues, and more.</P>
<P>And&nbsp;the majority of them actually could be parsed. </P>
<P>But this sentence was different:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=4>1. Turn on the head cover car turn off the motor after 10-15ms Cooling, take off the Lamp frame. Under the big space, it needn't to be moved.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>I think the intended meaning was:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Turn on the motor.<BR>Open the&nbsp;lamp head cover.<BR>Turn off the motor.<BR>After 10-15 seconds cooling, take off the lamp frame. <BR>It needn't to be moved under the big space.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>But even that does not seem like a 100% job. Between the wrongly order words, the lack of punctuation, the missing words, the incorrect punctuation, the strange capitalization, and more. There is a picture connected to the words but it doesn't really help much,&nbsp;even with the information about the "big space."</P>
<P>Now there are garden path sentences, and I have talked about them before (like <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/07/23/675957.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/07/23/675957.html"><STRONG>here</STRONG></A> and <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/10/16/833414.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/10/16/833414.html"><STRONG>here</STRONG></A> and <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/12/02/1193192.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/12/02/1193192.html"><STRONG>here</STRONG></A>). </P>
<P>But this is different. </P>
<P>It makes you stop and go back to try and re-parse like any good <A class="" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_Path_Sentence" mce_href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_Path_Sentence">Garden Path Sentence</A> (e.g. "The horse raced past the barn fell.").</P>
<P>But in this case there is no way to save the meaning. You just can't get there from here.</P>
<P>Thus it seems to me like kind of a (apologies to David/Chris/Jerry/Tina) <A class="" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_to_Nowhere" mce_href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_to_Nowhere">Road to Nowhere</A> sentence!</P>
<P>How would you parse it?</P>
<P>Any guesses on the initial language that led us down this "dead end" road?</P>

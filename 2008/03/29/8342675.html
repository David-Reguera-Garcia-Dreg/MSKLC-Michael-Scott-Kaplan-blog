<P>The question seemed so simple (as it usually does):</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times">Could you please explain me: why when I have the Arabic (Saudi Arabia) locale then the full date time format (“dddd, MMMM dd, yyyy HH:mm:ss”) actually looks as “dd tt hh:mm:ss MMMM, yyyy”. And opposite if conversation was done with the "dd tt hh:mm:ss MMMM, yyyy" pattern the result starts with substring "dd MMMM, yyyy"? Thanks for your attention.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Luckily sometimes the answer is simple, too! :-)</P>
<P>Let's take a look at this locale in Regional and Language Options, like right here:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/ltrrtl01.png"></P>
<P>and hit that <STRONG>Customize this format...</STRONG> button to get to the detail dialog about date formats.</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/ltrrtl02.png"></P>
<P>Believe it or not, this is expected -- it is basically something you can look at two different ways, both of which are technically valid (though the&nbsp;second is&nbsp;probably "more" valid!):</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The format strings themselves are using Latin script characters, which are always going to be&nbsp;normally used in a <STRONG>left-to-right</STRONG> context, while in the case of Arabic the actual string that has been formatted and which includes Arabic text will be displayed in a <STRONG>right-to-left</STRONG> context. So what appears on the surface to be a "reversed" string is actually just at RTL formatted string based on an LTR format string.<BR><BR>The format strings themselves are in <STRONG>logical</STRONG> order, which is always&nbsp;<STRONG>left-to-right</STRONG> and independent of how the final strings would be visibly displayed, while the formatted string in a language like Arabic will be displayed in a <STRONG>visual</STRONG> order that will be <STRONG>right-to-left</STRONG>.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>So nothing is <EM>really</EM> in the wrong order, and things are mostly behaving as they are designed to.</P>
<P>I'll talk about when things get a little weird in a new blog some day.... :-)</P>

<P>It is that time of year -- you know, when HR is in the air (so to speak).</P>
<P>It is the midyear, and everyone scrambles to fill in the forms and such, hoping it will keep the nag mails from coming but knowing somehow that they ill keep coming anyway, as all those who have finished already can readily attest!</P>
<P>Now perhaps it is because I have a blog that speaks so candidly about just about anything (too many things, according to some!) and most especially language issues, but I seem to attract a slightly greater than expected number of questions from non-native English speakers in the group about some of the language surrounding reviews....</P>
<P>Like the other day, when a colleague was genuinely confused about what actual difference was being conveyed between the words <STRONG>influence</STRONG> and <STRONG>impact</STRONG>.</P>
<P>I gave him some of the typical examples that they often give, but he had read those and still seemed a little unconvinced.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well," I suggested, "it's like my scooter."</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your scooter?" he asked, incredulously.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah, like my scooter. Let me explain...."</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I would like that," he said, clearly quite curious about what my scooter could have to do with the definition of two words that would be relevant.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well," I explain, "as I am scooting down the hallway, people will move out of the way without me saying a word, without the scooter ever touching them. That is because the scooter has <STRONG>influence</STRONG> over people. The scooter has <STRONG>influence</STRONG> over their behavior, in a way that people generally don't tend to in ordinary situations."</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And the <STRONG>impact</STRONG>?" he asked tentatively, almost afraid of the obvious answer and hoping that it will be something different.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, that one should be obvious -- if the scooter hits someone, there will be some serious <STRONG>impact</STRONG>. Like when KC used to ask us in triage over suggested development solutions <EM>What's the impact to test?</EM> but more directly -- the impact would be&nbsp;a scooter-shaped dent in a tester, or in the general case, in whoever the scooter hit," I explained wryly.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He shakes his head. "So you are saying that the <STRONG>influence</STRONG> is about people understanding the consequences of the <STRONG>impact</STRONG>? That doesn't seem right."</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, it isn't that simple. After all, who knows what is behind the&nbsp;<STRONG>influence</STRONG>, exactly?&nbsp;Maybe it is the fear of being hit, maybe they are being polite, maybe it is pity, maybe it is feeling bad about being in my way. The reason doesn't matter, in the end. It is an overlapping, sometimes but not always causative force."</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He nod his head slowly. "I think I understand what you mean."</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And there is another aspect as well," I continue, clearly on a roll. "If the scooter crashes into a wall, the <STRONG>impact</STRONG> is self evident after the crash. But in this case there was no <STRONG>influence</STRONG> whatsoever. It isn't like wall could get out of the way, or flinch, or even cry out a warning. So it is not only possible to have <STRONG>influence</STRONG> without <STRONG>impact</STRONG>; it is quite possible to see <STRONG>impact</STRONG> without <STRONG>influence</STRONG>!"</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

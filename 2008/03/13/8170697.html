<P>There are more and more senses to <STRONG>irony</STRONG> all of the time.</P>
<P>We have the actual definition of <STRONG>irony</STRONG> (the opposite of what is or might be expected).</P>
<P>And there is <STRONG>irony</STRONG><SMALL><SUP>Alanis</SUP></SMALL> based on the singer/songwriter ("it's like rain on your wedding day" -- which is more accurately described as unfortunate than <STRONG>ironic</STRONG>).</P>
<P>Of course there is <STRONG>irony</STRONG><SMALL><SUP>Katie</SUP></SMALL> from Katie Holmes in the mostly forgettable Teaching Mrs, Tingle (more metaphoric,&nbsp;maybe perhaps even symbolic, but no <STRONG>irony</STRONG> to speak of).</P>
<P>It may be tempting to consider including a <STRONG>irony</STRONG><FONT size=2><SMALL><SUP>Britney</SUP></SMALL> to cover the Fact that Britney Spears markets a fragrance under her name called <STRONG>Control</STRONG>, though ironically enough that is a valid use of the term <STRONG>irony</STRONG>, albeit an epic one....</FONT></P>
<P>And I wouldn't be doing my job if I did not mention the <STRONG>irony</STRONG><SMALL><SUP>mark</SUP></SMALL>, especially since it is something I have mentioned before (ref: <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/01/06/509784.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/01/06/509784.html"><STRONG>If it's not in Unicode, don't expect it in Windows</STRONG></A>). The irony mark not being made a part of Unicode is itself ironic, and one would wonder whether it needs to be encoded in order to properly describe its not being encoded in plain text on the rejected characters page, were that burst of self-reference not so apt to send one into "who shaves the Spanish barber" style&nbsp;catatonia worthy of an M5 meltdown at the hands of a Captain Kirk not given an alien woman to sleep with all episode....</P>
<P>And now we have <STRONG>irony</STRONG><SMALL><SUP>Heather</SUP></SMALL> (described in Heather Hamilton's&nbsp;<A class="" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/heatherleigh/archive/2008/03/11/what-does-irony-taste-like.aspx" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/heatherleigh/archive/2008/03/11/what-does-irony-taste-like.aspx">What does Irony Taste Like?</A> as either <EM>Super-light, not too fruity, high acid and clean finish</EM> or alternately <EM>essence of expectation with overtones of disappointment</EM>, presumably depending in part on how much of the bottle one puts away. :-)</P>

<p>I agree with John Cowan. &nbsp;This is a frequent topic of conversation with me: not only that people misuse the term (Allanis, other people that bug me), similarly as they do &quot;literally&quot;, but also my disappointment that irony is not a more complicated concept. The dolts that use the word to make themselves sound smart are coincidentally (but not ironically) using it correctly sometimes. In the interest of finding a more complicated concept that people can misuse in an effort to make themselves sound smarter (because irony is getting old), I submit this for your approval: gestalt.</p>
<p>And I have not yet seen in the wine section at QFC.</p></div>

<P>I decided to go out tonight<SUP><FONT size=1>1,2,3</FONT></SUP>.</P>
<P>Originally I wasn't going to. </P>
<P>It was a long day, I was tired.</P>
<P>Then I got a call. The call was at 7:52pm<SUP><FONT size=1>4</FONT></SUP>.</P>
<P>Who called? A friend.</P>
<P>A friend who wanted to know about the umlaut, but not that. You know, like the other word for that.</P>
<P>Confused by someone calling me at night to talk about umlauts but temporarily distracted by the fact that I knew the answer, I briefly explained the whole diaeresis/umlaut thing I described in <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/09/04/738263.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/09/04/738263.html"><STRONG>Every character has a story #24: U+0308 (COMBINING DIAERESIS)</STRONG></A>, ending on the fact that another name for the diaeresis is the trema.</P>
<P>It turns out that the word she was looking for....</P>
<P>I&nbsp;mentioned she could have looked it up here in the&nbsp;Blog<FONT size=1><SUP>5</SUP></FONT>, but she mentioned that she wasn't on the computer just then<SUP><FONT size=1>6</FONT></SUP>.</P>
<P>She began to thank me but then there was noise in the background. People had showed up and they were going out so she had to go. </P>
<P>She briefly stopped and I think realized how old and pathetic this quick "call and hang up"&nbsp;might make me feel, and apologized for being such a terrible person. But I shooed her off to go have fun. </P>
<P>And then I called some people<SUP><FONT size=1>7,8</FONT></SUP> in order to make sure that I wasn't actually going to in fact be pathetic....</P>
<P><EM>I somehow feel a strong need to not&nbsp;end up feeling pathetic due to actions of my blog's ex-girlfriend!&nbsp;</EM></P>
<P>In fact, I am leaving in a few minutes, so maybe some time over the weekend I'll blog again to let you all know how it turned out.</P>
<P><EM>They are here now and I could not think of a pun for the title so use your imagination on that bit!</EM></P>

<P><FONT size=1>1 - When I say tonight, I mean the night in which I am typing this blog, and since it won't go live until 12:01am, it means it will technically be tomorrow or later when you read it.<BR>2 - And the date on the blog will not match the date that I typed it.<BR>3 - Plus&nbsp;if you read it quickly enough after it goes live, I'll still be out.<BR>4 - I know because I just looked at the "recent calls" log.<BR>5&nbsp;- She used to be in love with this blog, as luck would have it.<BR>6&nbsp;- I&nbsp;was about&nbsp;to ask how the hell a <STRONG>trema</STRONG> came up outside of a work context, but I decided I would rather not know just then....<BR>7 - Who had talked to me earlier to ask if I wanted to go out.<BR>8 - They are the ones behind the&nbsp;large number of bottles of Mike's Hard Lemonade and Limeaid in my fridge, which I have not touched since it was left there from the last time they were here. :-)</FONT></P>

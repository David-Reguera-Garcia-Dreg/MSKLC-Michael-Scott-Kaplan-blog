<P>Presumed regular reader and extraregular (ref: ordinary vs. extraordinary to understand extraregular here!)&nbsp;human Doug Ewell asks:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><SPAN lang=EN>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times">Sorry, couldn't find this anywhere in SiaO, though I may not have looked hard enough.<BR><BR>Is there any way to define the keys on the numeric keypad (optionally with Shift and/or AltGr) using MSKLC?</FONT></P></SPAN></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>He might have been using the built-in search. I didn't have&nbsp;much luck with that either.</P>
<P>Perhaps unlike most of the company I work for, I have a simple daily algorithm I use for all of my searching through the ~2650+ blogs in the blog in this case where I know the content is there and remember some words in the blog:</P>
<OL>
<LI>The first search of the day I use Live Search</LI>
<LI>If the results are good, then I use Live Search for the rest of the day</LI>
<LI>If the results are not good, then I use Google for the rest of the day</LI></OL>
<P>Some zealots will feel I am betraying the company somehow, but I think if the stats of Google usage in Redmond are even 5% accurate I think I am being more than fair here.</P>
<P>Some others may object to the strategy since it seems really arbitrary. That is kind of the point for me, though....</P>
<P>Anyway, after my searching (I'll let you guess&nbsp;search engine&nbsp;I used -- it was my first search of the day!), I found the following relevant blogs which should help give Doug the good and bad answer he may or may not have been hoping for:</P>

<P>Which one is most likely to have the answer is left as an exercise for the reader. :-)</P>
<P>There were others, but the gist is pretty much gettable from these....</P>

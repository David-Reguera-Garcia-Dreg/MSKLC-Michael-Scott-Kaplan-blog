<p>When you call the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms632624.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms632624.aspx">WM_GETFONT</a> message to get the font from a control, the documentation says:</p><blockquote><p><font face="times new roman,times">The return value is a handle to the font used by the control, or NULL if the control is using the system font.</font></p></blockquote><p>And then when you look at the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms533223.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms533223.aspx">GetStockObject</a> function, which mentions:</p><blockquote><p><font face="times new roman,times">SYSTEM_FONT -- System font. By default, the system uses the system font to draw menus, dialog box controls, and text. </font><br></p></blockquote><p>It seems like the most intuitive thing in the world to assume they are talking about the same thing.</p><p>They aren't. </p><p>In fact, as Raymond Chen pointed out in <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/07/07/436435.aspx" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/07/07/436435.aspx">What are SYSTEM_FONT and DEFAULT_GUI_FONT?</a> and I pointed out in <b><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/04/28/585735.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/04/28/585735.html">DEFAULT_GUI_FONT really stinks</a></b>, SYSTEM_FONT is not the system font.</p><p>Or to be more accurate, once upon a time it was the system font.</p><p>Many years ago.</p><p>When internationalization support was a joke and language support was a dream.</p><p>And Reagan was starting to think about his re-election campaign.<br></p><p>So they really could rename the constant to <b>SYSTEM_FONT_CIRCA_1992</b>, deprecate the old one, and save everyone the confusion. :-)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><font color="#ff00ff"><i>This blog brought to you by</i><font size="7"> ! </font><i>(<a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0021" mce_href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0021">U+0021</a>, aka EXCLAMATION MARK, a character that was quite proud to be in the system font of even the earliest versions of Windows</i></font>)<br></p>

<p>The original title I had was &quot;...since George Bush wasn't re-elected&quot; (thinking George H.W.) but some people were really thinking the name was too much like the current prez and just a bad idea to get into, so I slid back to the previous one, who was elected for a second term, so I had to change that too. Of course now it was way before the value stopped getting used, but I decided now it was just hyperbole, which isn't inaccurate per se. :-)</p>
<p>Though like the ribbon it is now somewhat unraveled or unfurled. No sense trying to fix it since it is not the actual point of the article but more of a cute title thing....</p>

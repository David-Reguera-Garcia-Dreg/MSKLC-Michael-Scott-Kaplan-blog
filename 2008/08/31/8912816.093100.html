<p><font color="#ff0000"><i>The title of this blog is an allusion to a first season episode of The West Wing.</i></font></p><p><font color="#ff0000"><i>The crackpots reference is to the record amount of spam aimed at the Blog today, none of which was successfully posted. </i></font></p><p><font color="#ff0000"><i>You're welcome!</i> :-)</font></p><p>So I was watching this episode of The West Wing yesterday. I'm not sure exactly why, I was just reorganizing some video and accidentally opened it. I decided I may as well take it as a sign of some sort and watch it, on high speed.<br></p><p>Now all of this happened on Saturday.</p><p>After lunches earlier in the week with friend and lead program manager/most likely to be identified as the "group C.J." <b>Cathy Wissink</b>, and friend and software developer/long path princess <b>Kim Hamilton</b>.</p><p>Not to mention random emails from program manager and Access miracle worker <b>Viki Selca</b> and development lead and SQL Reporting Services miracle worker <b>Nico Cristache</b>. <br></p><p>And especially after car shopping and lunch with friend and always smiling program manager turned project manager <b>Maryam Gholami</b>, and dinner with friend and kickass trainer/consultant authoring the ASP.NET certification exam <b>Rachel Appel</b> (at a dinner where among other things we talked about friend and amazing db upsizer/programming writer <b>Mary Chipman</b>, friend and consultant/SQL goddess <b>Kimberly L. Tripp</b>, and friend and inspiration/general manager <b>Julie Bennett</b>.<br></p><p>Not to mention plans to have lunch this upcoming week with friend and marketing manager/HR sanity checker <b>Gretchen Ledgard</b>.<br></p><p>One bit of the episode in particular struck me:<br>
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="times new roman,times"><b>Jed Bartlet</b>: Look at this, will you?<br>
  <b>Josh Lyman</b>: At what sir?<br>
  <b>Jed Bartlet</b>: I don’t know why, but nothing makes me feel quite so good as the sight of colleagues, enjoying each other outside work.<b><br>
Josh Lyman</b>: So, what were you guys talking about?<br>
  <b>Jed Bartlet</b>: We were talking about these women.<br>
  <b>Josh Lyman</b>: Yeah?<br>
  <b>Leo McGarry</b>: We can’t get over these women.<br>
  <b>Jed Bartlet</b>: Look at C.J. She’s like a fifties movie star, so capable, so loving and energetic.<br>
  <b>Leo McGarry</b>: Look at Mandy over there. Going punch for punch
with Toby in a world that tells women to sit down and shut up. Mandy’s
already won her battle with the President. The game’s over, but she’s
not done. She wants Toby.<br>
  <b>Jed Bartlet</b>: Mrs. Landingham. Did you guys know she lost two
sons in Vietnam? What would make her want to serve her country is
beyond me, but in 14 years, she’s not missed a day’s work, not one.
{pause} There’s Cathy, Donna, and Margaret.<br>
  <b>Josh Lyman</b>: Mr. President, there’s something that’s been
bothering me for most of the day, and while I know that this is an
inappropriate time...<br>
  <b>Leo McGarry</b>: No, what’s on your mind, Josh?<br>
  <b>Josh Lyman</b>: I serve at the pleasure of the President, and it’s
a great privilege that I will never forget.&nbsp; I can’t keep this. I think
it’s a white flag of surrender. I want to be a comfort to my friends in
tragedy. And I want to be able to celebrate with them in triumph. And
for all the times in between, I just want to be able to look them in
the eye. Leo, it’s not for me. I want to be with my friends, my family,
and these women.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then I thought about these ten women, all of whom work either for Microsoft or primarily with Microsoft technologies.</p><p>Ten women with really very little else in common other than two X chromosomes.</p><p>Yet I find myself in awe of each of them and the work they do, all of which is also very different.</p><p>And all very inspiring, really (and not even a complete list!).<br></p><p>I just can't get over those women....</p><p><i>There are also women out there like McCain's VP choice to remind me that some women are actually quite singularly unimpressive, but that's a whole nuther story, and one much less inspiring!</i><br></p><p><br></p><p><font color="#ff00ff"><i>This blog brought to you by</i><font size="7"> ♀ </font><i>(<a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2640" mce_href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2640">U+2640</a>, aka FEMALE SIGN)</i></font> <br></p>

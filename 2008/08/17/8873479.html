<p>I probably stopped liking milk by itself around the time that I was 10, and stopped liking it even in cereal and Kraft Mac &amp; Cheese by the time I was 20.</p><p>It just never seemed cold enough -- so it tasted like it was going bad or something.</p><p>Hard to explain it, really.</p><p>Anyway, soon after that I started not liking water, either.</p><p>At first I switched to bottled water or nothing, which was less common then so usually I just had something other than water.</p><p>Eventually even the bottled water just wasn't cutting it.</p><p>I stopped drinking water before I hit 25, though very little after I was 22 anyway.</p><p>You know at restaurants they always give you water, even if you don't want it.</p><p>Just walking in someone who doesn't even talk to me gives me a glass of water that I'm not gonna drink.</p><p>I can refuse it, but no water glass just begs for some random server to get you a glass of water.</p><p>If you leave the glass there empty people keep trying to fill it, assuming I'm just a huge water drinker.</p><p>Even turning the glass uoside down doesn't help; someone with a pitcher will pass by and turn it over to fill it.</p><p>I finally just gave up; they fill the glass, and I just don't drink it.</p><p>People would ask about it, I would just tell them <b>that I am water soluable</b>.</p><p>They would be confused.</p><p>So I'd ask them if they ever saw <b>The Wizard of Oz</b>. </p><p>Of course they would say yes, so I 'd explain that the thing with the Wicked Witch of the West and the pail? </p><p>That witch, I'd explain, was water soluble.</p><p>This would lead to various reactions, usually amusement or bemusement.</p><p>Occasionally people would be very clever and point out how much it must suck to live in Seattle.</p><p>Other times I'd say it -- part of the shpiel, you know?</p><p>I'd explain it is not entirely a blocking issue -- it just makes things a little messier....</p><p>In recent times, I have found myself with people around me who consider this whole aspect of my personality to be kind of a health issue.</p><p>They aren't all girlfriends or anything, but they do seem to have that "mother-of-all-the-living" complex and they are concerned that I do my best to make sure I drink nothing but <b>Limonata</b>.</p><p>So they encourage me to drink water.</p><p>I do now occasionally have water. </p><p>And each time I do it I make sure to mention it.</p><p>Because I hate the way it tastes, and if I have to suffer I at least want to get the credit for having done it....</p><p>Now if I were a billionaire and I had these odd quirks then people would consider me eccentric. They definitely would after I added a post-mix fountain containing Limonata, which I would do if I were a billionaire.</p><p>Hell, I'd do that if it were less than that even.</p><p>But anyway since I'm not a billionaire, I think this just makes me weird.</p><p>In case you didn't think so already....</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><font color="#ff00ff"><i>This blog brought to you by</i><font size="6"> ä·œ </font><i>(<a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/4ddc" mce_href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/4ddc">U+4ddc</a>, aka HEXAGRAM FOR THE ABYSMAL WATER)</i></font> <br></p>

<p>But not in NYC. &nbsp;Good first time, every time.</p></div>

<p>Indeed, it works quite well! </p>

<p>There was a South Park episode about the smaug factor from all of the people who buy a prius and then love to fart because they assume their farts don't smell. New Yorkers have had that going on for years, obviously!</p>

I'd completely understand that, I can't eat tofu for the same reason - I bite into it and... nothing. No sensation at all. It's just weird.</p></div>

Might be a happy medium - has the benefits of flavor so improves the taste, and may not have all the additives that limonata has. (although vitamin waters have additives of their own)</p>
<p>another possibility would be to buy several different types of bottled water, and do a taste evaluation to see if you find any of them palatable.</p>

<p>I'll look into the vitamin water, in any case. Thanks!</p>

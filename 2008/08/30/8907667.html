<p>Okay, this blog is going to serve as a warning that a whole bunch of blogs in this Blog are about to happen about a particular topic.</p><p>The topic is one I have kind of talked about before.</p><p>The difference in software between UCS-2 and UTF-16, and what is involved with migrating code that "covers" the former to code that covers the latter.<br></p><p>Now the reason that this difference is interesting is just about everyone who is asking the questions (and there seem to be a lot of them, especially these last couple of weeks!), is handicapped by several issues, from incorrect assumptions about what works for them today to inaccurate picture of what they need to do to fix the problems to inappropriate plans for the scope of the work to plan.</p><p>It's a mess, it really is. I'm actually even going go change some of the content of a training presentation that is coming up to cover this topic a bit more, too.</p><p>Maybe I'll even mention this series! :-)</p><p>Anyway, consider this the content-free introduction to this exciting series.</p><p>If you are one of the people currently looking at this problem and are doing so with the unreserved joy one might feel for the removal of an impacted wisdom tooth, then this series is here especially for you! :-)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><font color="#ff00ff"><i>All of the characters in Unicode are taking the long weekend off. I'll see if some of the non-characters stuck in town might want to sponsor....</i></font> <br></p>

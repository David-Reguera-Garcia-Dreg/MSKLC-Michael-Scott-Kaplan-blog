<p>Idan asks (via the Contact link):</p><blockquote><p><i><font face="times new roman,times">Hello Michael,<br>I am reading your blog and wondering, can I start a blog on MSDN blogs too? Who is the address for this request?<br>Thank you, Idan.</font></i></p></blockquote><p>I looked at the information about setting up blogs, and ran across the following information:</p><blockquote><blockquote><font face="times new roman,times">Who can create and/or author a blog on blogs.msdn.com or blogs.technet.com?</font><br><br><font face="times new roman,times">§&nbsp; At this time, only full time employees of Microsoft may create a blog.&nbsp;</font></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>So it looks like the only way is to get a job working for Microsoft. :-)<br></p><p>For that kind of thing I of course highly recommend <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jobsblog" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jobsblog">Jobsblog</a>! </p><p>After you get hired then you can create a Blog here and blog away....</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 255);"><span style="font-style: italic;">This blog brought to you by</span><font size="6"> ? </font><span style="font-style: italic;">(<a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/003f" mce_href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/003f">U+003f</a>, aka QUESTION MARK)</span></span> <br></p>

<p>I'm only a junior developer myself (I'm still learning the basics of .net development), and I have a strong feeling that being able to read the blogs of more experienced developers than myself can only be highly beneficial to my learning experience...</p></div>

Wow! Much better than Google: I never received anything from them for my BlogSpot account.</p></div>

<p>Not something I have a whole lots of say in, but it is &nbsp;big huge Internet with lots of blog sites, many of which have blogs that focus on .NET technologies. These two sites are reserved for people who work for Microsoft. Perhaps they too can provide something to learn from. :-)</p>

<p>Sorry, that would never happen. You have to get the job first, and then either blog on your own or convince the group you work for that they should have you spend your work time doing it.... :-)</p>

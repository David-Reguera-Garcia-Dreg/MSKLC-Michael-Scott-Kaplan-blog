<p>The issue was something I was aware of before Doron mentioned the word in <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/doronh/archive/2008/03/18/once-not-disableable-forever-not-disableable.aspx" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/doronh/archive/2008/03/18/once-not-disableable-forever-not-disableable.aspx">Once not disableable, forever not disableable</a> and then talked a bit about the word itself in <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/doronh/archive/2008/03/18/inconceivableable.aspx" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/doronh/archive/2008/03/18/inconceivableable.aspx">Inconceivableable</a>.</p>
<p>In its own way, <b>inconceivableable</b> is probably a better model for what is doing on here.</p>
<p>After all, to <b>conceive</b> of an idea is to form an idea.</p>
<p>For an idea to be <b>conceivable</b> one would be capable of conceiving of it.</p>
<p>For an idea to be <b>inconceivable</b> one would be incapable of conceiving of it.</p>
<p>And for an idea to be <b>inconceivableable</b> one would be incapable of being able to determine whether one would be incapable of conceiving of it. :-)</p>
<p>Now <b>disableable</b> kind of falls into the same category, with to <b>disable</b> meaning to make unfit or unable, and you can do the same word dance to build up the word.</p>
<p>Could a better term have been used? Sure.</p>
<p>That could have been done with lots of words. Words like <b>disambiguate</b>, as I mentioned in <b><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/06/28/433365.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/06/28/433365.html">The 'grammar of identifiers</a></b>.</p>
<p>Would life be easier is such words were not spontaneously developed, if English were not a "productive" language?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>But life isn't just about being easy.</p>
<p>And there are more ways to serve a cat than buttering it with parsnips, too.</p>
<p>Sometimes we work so hard to build up from the terms that we know that we don't look for the better term to use....<br></p>
<p>So from now on in my mind, when I think about this <b>Blog</b> and what I <b>blog</b> in it, I will continue to wonder about the constant curiosity about what is <b>bloggable</b>.</p>
<p>More importantly, I will wonder about the many things I consider <b>unbloggable</b> (and the larger list of things that some my sharper critics and dissenters feel should be in that list).<br></p>
<p>And perhaps most importantly, I will wonder about the items that are unbloggableable, even though I am having trouble conceiving of exctly what that term is supposed to mean.</p>
<p>Perhaps the problem is a positional one -- and I don't know whether the word refers to that which is <b>(unbloggable)able</b> or <b>un(bloggableable)</b> or something like that.</p>
<p>Do either of those feel more natural to me? </p>
<p>Well, if nothing else I have a hard time discerning the exact meaning -- thus it is kinda inconceivableable to me.</p>
<p>Though in the end hard to say for sure, since a few years ago the sentence <b>As I write a blog for this Blog</b> would have felt like fingernails on the chalkboard and now feels right. Perhaps one day the word will seem like a good thing to me. <br></p>
<p>Though frankly that is <b>inconceivableable</b> to me at present.... </p>
<p>Perhaps I an distracted by the recent passing of Isaac Hayes. Though he had been slipping for the last while. :-(<br></p>
<p>Ignore the <b>uncomfortableable</b> bit in the title, I just stuck that in there. Essentially it is (in this case) a back-formation since I didn't actually use the word in its intended way but instead as an artificial construct to make a somewhat humorous point (though in theory it could have been deconstructed in the same way, you now have the pragmatic knowledge of my motivations and the consequent attempt at humor.<i><br></i></p>
<p><i>Of course, no explained joke ever works. To be honest, this one wouldn't have really worked anyway as it was fairly lame. Sorry about that! </i><br></p>

<p>The dictionary says &quot;undoable&quot; means something unattainable: &quot;An undoable plan&quot; might mean you don't have the necessary money or people.</p>
<p>However, especially in the world of computers and UI, it is often used to mean something that can be undone: &quot;An undoable edit control&quot; might be an edit control with an undo function.</p>
<p>Maybe things of these sorts kind of... evolve after a while.</p></div>

<h1>Migrating docs forward vs. moving 'em forward</h1>

<p>The mail from the contact list:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font face="times new roman,times"><i>"Though ultimately the funniest part being the requirements for both functions:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Client Requires Windows Vista, Windows XP, or Windows 2000 Professional.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Server Requires Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2003, or Windows 2000 Server.<br>This is something that makes very little sense given just the header file alone, let alone the pragmatic knowledge between the two topics and the past knowledge of many a Windows developer. :-)"<br></i><br>Dig out the Platform SDK for Windows Server 2003 SP1's documentation.

<p>The reference was from my blog <b><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/07/01/8675015.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/07/01/8675015.html">Oceania is at war with WM_SETTINGCHANGE; Oceania has always been at war with WM_SETTINGCHANGE</a></b>.</p>

<p>Holy missing my point, Batman!</p>

<p>I understand the idea behind yanking out information about versions that are no longer supported.</p>

<p>That even makes sense.</p>

<p>But when looking at topics like the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms725499.aspx" class="" mce_href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms725499.aspx">WM_WININICHANGE</a> 
message and the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms725497.aspx" class="" mce_href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms725497.aspx">WM_SETTINGCHANGE</a> 
message, there is more involved than just taking Win9x off the list. There is in such topics huge allusions to backcompat and prior versions, versions which no longer exist.</p>

<p>In this new world there are only three choices:</p>

<ul>
<li>Remove all of the extraneous just say one message is preferred over the other -- even removing all but the reference from one of them (in a world with constants like these and ones described in <b><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2004/12/26/332392.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2004/12/26/332392.html">Is it Hangul? or Hangeul? or Han'gŭl? or what?</a></b> I doubt they would ever be removed from the header files, even if relegated to losing their explanations);</li>

<li>Take out the text regarding version preference and just have the two constants that are left alone;</li>

<li>Do nothing, and be stuck with people like me poking fun at the weirdness of the text.</li>
</ul>

<p>Personally, though I find the third option to be the most fun from the standpoint of writing blogs, I kind of prefer the first choice best....</p>

<p>That is the whole method behind the madness in topics like <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa383722.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa383722.aspx">Obsolete Windows Programming Elements</a>, after all.</p>

<p>And I think <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms725499.aspx" class="" mce_href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms725499.aspx">WM_WININICHANGE</a> 
message is honestly much more of something there for compatibility with 16-bit Windows anyway, the parent topic in which <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa383722.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa383722.aspx">Obsolete Windows Programming Elements</a> sits. It was indeed 16-bit Windows that using WIN.INI wasn't discussed in terms of backcompat.</p>

<p>Though it makes me wonder whether the answer is to expand the topic to include Win9x, or have a separate set of topics for the Win9x backcompat story.</p>

<p>I could really see that one argued either way (though <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms725499.aspx" class="" mce_href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms725499.aspx">WM_WININICHANGE</a> is really there for 16-bit more than anything else, there may be other elements more suited to Win9x compatibility!).... </p>

<hr/><p><strong>Yuhong Bao</strong> on 14 Aug 2008 6:44 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>If you are curious, I posted this comment and sent this email about the docs.</p>
<p>&quot;WM_WININICHANGE is really there for 16-bit&quot;</p>
<p>WM_SETTINGCHANGE did not exist in NT 3.x, at least according to the Platform SDK for Windows Server 2003 SP1's documentation.</p>
<p>Many people believe Win95 was the first 32-bit OS. NOT TRUE! NT 3.1 was the first released 32-bit OS.</p>
<p>Also, it isn't just Win9x, NT 4 and earlier info are also being eliminated from the docs.</p></div>

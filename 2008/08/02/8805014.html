<h1>A serious lack of overlap with 64</h1>

<P>So it started over on the <STRIKE><FONT color=#999999>Vista</FONT></STRIKE>Windows Experience Blog's blog <A class="" href="http://windowsvistablog.com/blogs/windowsexperience/archive/2008/07/31/watch-nbc-s-coverage-of-the-beijing-olympics-in-windows-media-center.aspx" mce_href="http://windowsvistablog.com/blogs/windowsexperience/archive/2008/07/31/watch-nbc-s-coverage-of-the-beijing-olympics-in-windows-media-center.aspx">Watch NBC‚Äôs coverage of the Beijing Olympics in Windows Media Center</A>.</P>
<P>Some eager folks who downloaded the client were dismayed to see it was 32-bit only. Brandon (the blog's author) mentioned in comments that there&nbsp;may be news on this in the future, so perhaps there is eventual hope.</P>
<P>Garrett McGowan summed up my feelings nicely:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><EM><FONT face="times new roman,times">Awesome! Except...after downloading the 10MB client, I'm informed that 'Sorry, 32-bit Windows Vista only.' <BR><BR>Foot, meet bullet.<BR><BR>I'm serious about 64-bit. I've been running 64-bit on my primary home machine since February 2007. I put up with the early, shaky device drivers. I put up with the late availability of Windows Live software and the incredibly late Windows Home Server Client. Actually no, I gave up on that one, along with Creative's X-Fi full-feature drivers (they finally dropped this week). But now this.<BR><BR>When is the 'ecosystem' going to take 64-bit seriously?</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P mce_keep="true">I agree 100%.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">I had one of my own situations like that recently. I had finally decided to dump the 50gb of space I had set aside for the 32-bit version of Vista on my MacBook Pro and just go full 64-bit and use the space for other purposes.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">Soon after, I had installed many language packs, and subsequently made a sad discovery.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">Language Interface Packs were not being made available for 64-bit.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">"How could that be?" I wondered. I mean, the build process for them is the same as for the Language Packs that are available for 64-bit. The only difference is that they end up building a bit faster since by definition that have fewer language resources in them. I knew they could easily exist, I must be mistaken in my investigation that seemed to indicate they weren't available.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">But it was no mistake -- someone had deemed that the overlap of people running on <STRONG>64-bit&nbsp;hardware</STRONG> and the people who need&nbsp;<STRONG>Language Interface Packs</STRONG>&nbsp;because they need windows in their native language was apparently not high enough to really merit the resources to release the 64-bit LIPs.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">So there was no reason for the official build machines to build them since they weren't being released like the 32-bit ones were.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">And&nbsp;there was no specific reason to test them since they weren't being released like the 32-bit ones were.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">Lame.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">Though I suppose this is&nbsp;a trend that can be easily reversed when/if the determination is made that the overlap of hardware and language makes it more sensible, strategically.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">This is hardly isolated, mind you. There are way too many examples where people just don't think 64-bit is needed. At least not yet.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">But then like many I wonder how all of the predictions about the end of 32-bit on the horizon can be true when there are so many examples like this happening.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">In the meantime, we won't be watching the Olympics on our 64-bit machines while we are in India, which is maybe okay because the Olympics viewing is currently supported in the US only anyway.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">But that is a rant for another day....</P>

<hr/><p><strong>anony.muos</strong> on 2 Aug 2008 5:03 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Since this blog is related to fonts/typography, I'd like to mention that probably the shell team in Vista forgot to add some special menu items which the Font folder has in Vista's Explorer. I can't locate &quot;Hide variations (Bold, Italic etc)&quot; command in Vista's Font folder which was very useful in counting the actual number of fonts and quickly previewing them. The preview pane is a lot useful for the fonts folder but now in Vista, you have to skip every 2 files (Bold, Italic), when previewing fonts. Also, view fonts by similarity seems to have disappeared by itself. Hopefully, this'll be fixed in Windows 7.</p></div>

<p>The day before Chris Flores posted &quot;Windows Vista 64-bit Today&quot; because there's a trend showing 64-bit is approaching mainstream</p>

<p><strong>int19h</strong> on 2 Aug 2008 9:54 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>The 64-bit move will happen during the next RAM increase - with 2Gb average in new machines, and 4Gb in the high-end ones, we're already right at the limit of 32-bit. Also, I don't know about others, but personally I'm rather annoyed that 32-bit Vista can only use 3.1Gb out of those 4 I have in my notebook - and that alone a pretty convincing reason to move to x64.</p></div>
<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 2 Aug 2008 11:36 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>But does that mean they are right since the main markets for LIPs are well behind the folks in the US who buy new machines so often?</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Dean Harding</strong> on 2 Aug 2008 6:09 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>I had a similar experience with the Microsoft Fingerprint Reader. Somebody gave me one, once and I figured I'd give it a go (it seems like a cool idea).</p>
<p>But there's no 64-bit drivers for it. The thing was totally annoyed me is that the device is simply re-branded from an OEM, and the OEM HAD 64-BIT DRIVERS! But not Microsoft! What does that say about Microsoft's platform strategy?</p>
<p>Fair enough it's only one device, and probably not particularly popular -- and thankfully, I got it for free anyway :p -- but it just goes to show, there's some people in Microsoft who are just not serious about 64-bit.</p>
<p>Also, with the thing about memory, it's not that 32-bit Windows does not support &gt; 3.xGB of physical RAM, it's that there will always be a &quot;gap&quot; in the 3-4GB range (due to DMA devices &quot;reserving&quot; some of it. So if you put 8GB in there, Windows would be able to use 7.1GB or something like that.</p></div>
<p><strong>Igor Levicki</strong> on 3 Aug 2008 9:14 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>They are right Michael, poor countries and poor people cannot afford 4GB of RAM. They usually go with 1GB or 2GB.</p>
<p>However I would blame Microsoft for poor 64-bit OS adoption:</p>
<p>1. There wasn't enough pressure on hardware vendors to deliver drivers (for example, NVIDIA never released 64-bit WDM drivers for 7800 GT VIVO capable cards and that was a mainstream product!)</p>
<p>2. Releasing 32-bit Vista version was a mistake. You should have released only 64-bit version.</p></div>
<p><strong>Dean Harding</strong> on 3 Aug 2008 11:40 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>&quot;Releasing 32-bit Vista version was a mistake. You should have released only 64-bit version.&quot;</p>
<p>I agree with this, too. At least in an ideal world... I'm pretty sure I read that there will be a 32-bit version of Windows 7, but I sure wish there wasn't. :-)</p></div>
<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 4 Aug 2008 2:20 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>With most hardware unwilling to provide drivers or unable to support it, and the majority of customers only supporting/OEMs only installing 32-bit versions on 64-bit hardware, I can't see how this is gonna happen any time soon....</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Mihai</strong> on 4 Aug 2008 3:25 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Same here: my laptop has 4GB, but I can only use 3.</p>
<p>Considered moving to 64 bit, but the main problem is Cisco, with no 64 bit VPN client (and no plans to release one).</p>
<p>And unlike regular applications, 32 bit drivers can't run on Vista :-(</p></div>

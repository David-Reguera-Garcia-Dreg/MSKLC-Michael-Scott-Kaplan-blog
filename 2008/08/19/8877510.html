<h1>The super-cool panel about Windows, .NET, and SQL Server -- now live!</h1>

<p>Last night, at the <a href="http://www.netda.net/" mce_href="http://www.netda.net/">.NET Developer's Association</a> meeting, I got to see Kimberly Tripp and her husband do a pretty awesome talk about SQL Server index internals and fragmentation. In the conversation after I was reminded of a whole pile of SQL Server blogs that I have to jump in and do. I'll have to start getting on that....</p><p>There was also a bit of news earlier in the day which was also very nice.</p><p>About the super-cool panel about Windows, .NET, and SQL Server, which at long last is now available!</p><p>This is a <b>panel</b> that I was involved with while I was over at TechEd earlier this summer.</p><p>The title? </p><blockquote><p><font size="4"><b>Internationalization and SQL Server: Sorting out Collations between Windows and .NET</b></font><br></p></blockquote>

<p>The title might sound difficult to navigate, but it isn't -- just plug in your high quality parser and go for it! :-)<br></p><p>I originally pitched the idea of this panel and though Steven Seim seemed enthusiastic, the people tapped to do it showed varying lesser degrees of enthusiasm, probably based on their respective levels of busy-ness they each had to deal with that week. Though everyone seemed up fr it by the time we were ready to go and kind of had the roadmap for the kind of stuff we wanted to cover.</p><p>The idea came about by accident, originally based a phone conversation between Goldie and I probably six months or longer before all this, about some of the issues that SQL Server handles so much better than Windows -- like multiple version handling and real backcompat support. At the time I realized how much better of a place SQL Server was than Windows. It was almost like it was evolutionary steps beyond Windows because of those scenarios. And how it worked with managed code (aka the Hosted CLR) was yet another dimension to consider. It thought it would be useful to talk about it....</p>

<p>The original list of participants for the panel:<br></p>

<ul>
<li><b>Mary Chipman</b> acting as the moderator</li>

<li><b>Goldie Chaudhuri</b> from the SQL Server side</li>

<li><b>Michael Kaplan</b> (yours truly!) from the Windows side<br></li>
</ul>

<p>This was kind of the original plan for the panel, and I think it would have been a perfectly fine and useful presentation of information.</p>

<p>But then, enter Kent Alstad from <a href="http://www.strangeloopnetworks.com/" mce_href="http://www.strangeloopnetworks.com/">Strangeloop</a>, and The Real World! :-)<br></p>

<p>Kent was our wildcard, our man of mystery, the one who took the panel and really helped us turned it up to eleven -- made it about some real customer-facing issues that developers are all too often hit with, and hit with hard.</p>

<p>Like I said, the original plan was a good one.</p>

<p>But what the four of us did? It put the original plan to shame and turned "good" into "great" faster than you can say morebetter!<br></p>

<p>The description of the session:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font face="times new roman,times"><i>The collation support in SQL Server has been based on Windows since 7.0, even though the data has never been the same between them in any version of SQL Server or Windows. This panel will look at the technical and philosophical differences between them and the effect on results, as well as the impact of the .NET Framework on both of them—and the effect of all of these various differences on developers of any or all of them.</i></font><br></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And this is up to and including how to get both the best possible
results, and the most consistent ones (hint: the number 2008 may come
up three times, genuinely!).</p><p>You can see the session on the big list of panels and talks with all the others <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/events/teched/cc676818.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/events/teched/cc676818.aspx">here</a>:<br></p>

<blockquote><blockquote><p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/events/teched/cc676818.aspx" target="_blank" mce_href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/events/teched/cc676818.aspx"><img src="http://microsofttech.fr.edgesuite.net/TechEdOnline/Pictures/tp26.jpg" mce_src="http://microsofttech.fr.edgesuite.net/TechEdOnline/Pictures/tp26.jpg" style="border-width: 0px; height: 240px; width: 320px;" border="0"></a></p></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>And you can download it as podcast or video -- a <a href="http://microsofttech.fr.edgesuite.net/TechEdOnline/Videos/08_NA_Dev_TEOPanel_26_low.wmv" mce_href="http://microsofttech.fr.edgesuite.net/TechEdOnline/Videos/08_NA_Dev_TEOPanel_26_low.wmv">WMV</a>, an <a href="http://microsofttech.fr.edgesuite.net/TechEdOnline/Videos/08_NA_Dev_TEOPanel_26_high.mp4" mce_href="http://microsofttech.fr.edgesuite.net/TechEdOnline/Videos/08_NA_Dev_TEOPanel_26_high.mp4">MP4</a>, or an <a href="http://microsofttech.fr.edgesuite.net/TechEdOnline/Videos/08_NA_Dev_TEOPanel_26_audio.MP3" mce_href="http://microsofttech.fr.edgesuite.net/TechEdOnline/Videos/08_NA_Dev_TEOPanel_26_audio.MP3">MP3</a>, and see and/or hear the whole thing.</p><p>This was a lot of fun to do, and hopefully some people here will find it fun to watch!</p><p>For those who are interested, the other video I was involved with (a conversation between Mary and I, entitled <b>Beyond FxCop-style Internationalization in .NET</b>) is also available up on that same site in both video and podcast. Though not as cool as the panel, it also has some interesting stuff in it....<br></p><p>Enjoy! :-)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><font color="#ff00ff"><i>This blog brought to you by</i><font size="6"> ꌚ </font><i>(<a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/a31a" mce_href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/a31a">U+a31a</a>, aka YI SYLLABLE SOP)</i></font><br></p>

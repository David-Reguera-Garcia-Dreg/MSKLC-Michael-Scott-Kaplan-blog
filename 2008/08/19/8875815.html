<p>There is an uncomfortable amount of truth in a somewhat offensive metaphor the recent <a href="http://www.xkcd.com/" mce_href="http://www.xkcd.com/">XKCD</a> comic:</p>

<p><a href="http://xkcd.com/463/" mce_href="http://xkcd.com/463/"><img src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/xkcd01.png" title="And that's *another* crypto conference I've been kicked out of.  C'mon, it's a great analogy!" alt="Voting Machines" border="0"></a></p>

<p>I won't claim the analogy shouldn't get panned (as the tooltip kind of hints it will be and I might agree perhaps ought).</p><p>Though it does help underscore an all-too-common problem in logic.</p><p>And rationalization. <br></p><p>Perhaps we could all strive to have more defensible chains of logic in our thought processes, rather than relying on the shaky logic of the unrelated precedent.<br></p><p><font size="1"><i>This blog is not aimed at anyone in particular; the people guilty of such lapses "know" they are doing The Right Thing</i><i>™</i><i>; it is why the guy hanging out in the shadows of The X-Files in the first episode (CSM) was also the one Mulder and Scully visited in the end of the series as well -- such people are survivors. </i>:-)</font><br></p>

<p>Nice kanjxi today tho :)</p></div>

<p>I believe the analogy is strong -- it's disturbing that either would believe they would end up in a situation where they'd need such protection. &nbsp;</p></div>

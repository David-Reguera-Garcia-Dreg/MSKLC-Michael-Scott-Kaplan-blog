<h1>A blog, warning you to please read the disclaimer before looking at this Blog!</h1>
<p><em>by Michael S. Kaplan, published on 2008/02/28 03:01 -05:00, original URI: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/michkap/archive/2008/02/28/7925701.aspx</em></p>
<hr/> <!-- Archival Source: ProcessPostNew -->
<P>I would like to think that all of the people who read some or all of this blog (whether said reading takes place occasionally, all the time, or somewhere in between), understand the blog's nature.</P>
<P>In particular, when I think this, I like to think specifically about the Blog's disclaimer, which is:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=7><FONT color=#000000 size=2>Postings are provided <B>as is</B> with no warranties, and confer no rights. Opinions expressed here are my own delusions; my employers at best shake their heads and sigh, at worst repudiate the content with extreme prejudice, whenever it manages to appear on their radar.</FONT></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Maybe I should add some&nbsp;emphasis there. I'll try again:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000 size=4>Postings are provided <B>as is</B> with no warranties, and confer no rights. Opinions expressed here are my own delusions; my employers at best shake their heads and sigh, at worst repudiate the content with extreme prejudice, whenever it manages to appear on their radar.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>That's better!</P>
<P>Now over the life of <STRONG>Sorting it all Out</STRONG>, this text has subtly changed, e.g. "<STRONG>if it were ever to</STRONG>" morphing to "<STRONG>whenever it manages to</STRONG>" after it turned out that my management was running across the odd post from time to time, or perhaps more often. But the spirit of the words has remained steadfast.</P>
<P>Everything I post here, no matter what the source (whether from within Microsoft or without), is posted through the uniquely strange prism that is my brain, and therefore it is:</P>
<UL>
<LI>entirely <STRONG>appropriate</STRONG> for you to place as much faith and credence in the words here as you feel that I deserve myself, on my own merits, as you might any software developer you read the words of who has a great love of&nbsp;his or her&nbsp;work, <STRIKE><FONT color=#999999>delusions</FONT></STRIKE>notions of linguistic aptitude, a knack for reading&nbsp;his or her own MRIs, and a love of San Pellegrino Limonata;</LI>
<LI>entirely <STRONG>inappropriate</STRONG> for you to assume that any of it represents the opinions of any person or&nbsp;people or team or group or division&nbsp;at Microsoft with authority to speak for Microsoft, and that further to that end lending whatever faith and credence (or lack thereof) you would&nbsp;to Microsoft would in fact represent serious&nbsp;flaws and/or limitations in your own decision-making paradigm that you may want to reconsider before you make a similar mistake in life (and walk in front of a train or stick your tongue in a light socket!).</LI></UL>
<P>In fact, I would go so far to say that hypothesizing that any opinion I state could even result in policy maker(s) within Microsoft&nbsp;changing direction completely for the sole purpose of proving me officially wrong is, while probably not true in either the <STRONG>capital B Blog</STRONG> or <STRONG>lowercase B blog</STRONG> sense, not something I would be willing to bet heavy against, myself.</P>
<P>In previous posts I have spoken ill of the people who&nbsp;might show such&nbsp;lapses in&nbsp;judgment, even going so far as to cast aspersions like <STRONG>utter moronic wingnut</STRONG> on therm. In retrospect this is kind of mean and even if true it was probably unkind of me to say so, and just as I do not make fun of&nbsp;those who <EM>do</EM> walk in front of trains or stick their tongues in light sockets, I should not make fun of these people.</P>
<P>Bottom line: I don't want people making fun of me for being unable to stand upright without falling, and therefore should not make fun of people who fail to grok something I write here (or who I'm speaking for when I write it).</P>
<P>Therefore I won't do that anymore.</P>
<P>Now as to the future, if you get&nbsp;a business card from me as of my next order&nbsp;then my blog URL won't be on it. And&nbsp;not that you can see my commitments (my management excluded of course!), but any mention of the blog within my commitments (incidental or not)&nbsp;will be removed during an explicit scrub during the midyear.</P>
<P>While various facets of my job and the people I work with will likely continue to inspire the Blog or the blogs therein, I neither desire nor expect any facet of my Blog or the blogs&nbsp;therein to inspire my management's perception of the work I do.</P>
<P>With all that said, I personally believe that what I do here in this blog actually <EM>does</EM> have some modicum of usefulness for both me as the author and for&nbsp;some of you as the readers. And&nbsp;after Denethor (and Tolkien!)&nbsp;I'll say that I will continue to blog in just the same&nbsp;way, f"rom this hour henceforth, until&nbsp;R.I.F. release&nbsp;me, or&nbsp;death take me, or the world end" (or I am directed not to!).</P>
<P>It is vaguely possible that,&nbsp;over time,&nbsp;some of the people within Microsoft who feel that (all things being equal)&nbsp;<STRONG>Sorting it all Out</STRONG>&nbsp;tends to&nbsp;have a less than stellar effect on customer perception of the work the group does will reconsider their position, though offhand I'm inclined to doubt it will make a bucket of piss's worth of difference, and therefore I won't hold my breath hoping for change.</P>
<P><EM>Though if you are internal to Microsoft and run across a particular blog that helped you then feel free to tell my management about the experience, especially if you plan to be specific&nbsp;about it....</EM></P>
<P>My own voice (enhanced by my opinions), is an unsuitable representative of Microsoft Corporation, and given the choice between being an honest rebel and a dishonest boy scout, I choose the former, with neither regret nor&nbsp;apology. So help me blog.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT color=#ff00ff><EM>Many of the characters within Unicode were eager to sponsor this&nbsp;blog (and/or the "character"&nbsp;the&nbsp;author&nbsp;looks at in the mirror each morning!)&nbsp;but I did not want to tarnish their reputations and thanked them but then regretfully declined.</EM></FONT></P>

<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 28 Feb 2008 10:04 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Hey John, </p>
<p>I will leave that for others to judge. And I took the oath after Denethor said it, the same way Peregrin son of Paladin did. :-)</p>

<p><strong>Jan Goyvaerts</strong> on 29 Feb 2008 8:32 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Michael,</p>
<p>Have you ever considered splitting your blog into two? &nbsp;You could have one blog that (mostly) relates to your job, and one that (mostly) doesn't. &nbsp;People who want to read everything you write would simply add both to their newsreader, while others wouldn't have to skip the half of your blog they're not interested in or get irritated about it.</p>
<p>I'm planning to do just that with my own blog, not because my boss wants me to remove the URL from my card, but because I want to add the URL of the part of my blog that's relevant to the card.</p></div>
<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 29 Feb 2008 9:31 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Hi Jan,</p>
<p>I have considered it from time to time, but the blog is meant to be an extension of me, and fragmenting me into pieces just doesn't appeal all that much (keeping track of two different blogs even less so!).</p>
<p>Besides, ignoring what the specific elements of the management in my group feels for just a moment, I have had enough people at Microsoft tell me that they consider it required reading for internationalization stuff in *their* groups, whether it is a &quot;personal&quot; blog or no.</p>
<p>In time maybe that &quot;content not approved by Microsoft&quot; tag might be considered some kind of &quot;quality&quot; stamp, at which point I'd be awfully embarrassed to have been so adamant on the subject with an employee of mine! :-)</p>

<p><strong>Mikkin</strong> on 3 Mar 2008 6:16 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Michael, &quot;I can't believe you had to say that.&quot; On behalf of utter moronic wingnuts such as myself, I am very sorry some of us have been causing you grief.</p></div>
<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 3 Mar 2008 7:39 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Thanks, Mikkin! Though I think anyone who would take the time apologize probably doesn't need to; the cause of the problem lies in those who wouldn't? :-)</p>

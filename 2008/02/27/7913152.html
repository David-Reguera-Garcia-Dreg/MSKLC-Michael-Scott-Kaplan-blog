<P>Okay, we are not quite at the point where one would yell <STRONG>Stop the Presses!</STRONG> if there was some kind of urgent problem that would require attention. I have no idea what that process would look like -- say if the website were on fire or something?</P>
<P>Well, you can also report any editorial comments, too....</P>
<P>Anyway, we can sit around and wait for the release.</P>
<P>I'll open a box of <STRONG>Grapheme Clusters</STRONG> </P>

<P>and we'll&nbsp;make a party of it....</P>
<P>It is funny, it was just yesterday I was mentioning grapheme clusters in Unicode in a comment, and today we're eating the cookies. Awesome!</P>

<H2><A class="" title=Summary name=Summary></A>A. Summary</H2>
<P>Unicode 5.1 brings major benefits: improvements for security in data exchange, character additions to support Indic and South East Asian scripts, improvements to the Unicode Linebreaking Algorithm statement of conformance, standardized named sequences for Lithuanian, and provisional named sequences for Tamil. Identifiers were expanded to allow full support for Indic and Arabic scripts.</P>
<P>Implementers will find new test data files and additional new XML data files with character properties for all Unicode characters. </P>
<P>Several important property definitions were extended, improving linebreaking for Polish and Portuguese hyphenation. The Unicode Text Segmentation Algorithms, covering sentences, words, and characters, were greatly enhanced by creating extended combining character sequences that improve the processing of Tamil and other Indic languages. The Unicode Normalization Algorithm now defines stabilized strings and provides guidelines for buffering. </P>
<P>This latest version of Unicode adds new characters required for Malayalam and Myanmar and important individual characters such as <I>Latin capital sharp s</I> for German. Version 5.1 extends support for languages in Africa, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, and Vietnam, with the addition of the Cham, Lepcha, Ol Chiki, Rejang, Saurashtra, Sundanese, and Vai scripts. Scholarly support includes important editorial punctuation marks, as well as the Carian, Lycian, and Lydian scripts, and the Phaistos disc symbols. Other new symbol sets include dominoes, Mahjong, dictionary punctuation marks, and math additions. Unicode 5.1 contains significant additions and improvements that extend text processing for software worldwide.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

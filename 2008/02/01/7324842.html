<P>Yes, I am on my way back to Redmond now, somewhere over atop some segment of my potential readership.</P>
<P><EM>For security reasons and fear that a disgruntled former reader </EM><EM>with a rocket launcher might <STRONG>use</STRONG> the information, I won't give the exact flight number or location.</EM></P>
<P><EM>Well, that and the fact that doing exact time calculations for time while in the middle of flying across time zones gives me a headache. I am not Rainman, sorry!</EM></P>
<P>By the next time a blog post is due (after the pre-recorded one coming up in a few minutes), I'll either be a charred piece of meat next to a "black box" flight recorder, or I will be home safe in Redmond writing about reversing sort keys and seeing how much my stuff was stolen during my absence (despite people checking regularly!).</P>
<P>If you read the preceding sentence implying&nbsp; plane crash, please be sure to do whatever superstitious gesture is appropriate for your culture, of course. :-)</P>
<P>Catch you all tomorrow!</P>

<p>Just knocked in the wood and crossed my fingers (both are in use, but usually you do only one of them :-)</p></div>

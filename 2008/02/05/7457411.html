<P>In Windows, as in life, it is important to keep a bit of independence from one's parents.</P>
<P>They may have&nbsp; lot to do with your initial placement, sure. But beyond that, they don't get to be too involved....</P>
<P>I remembered this a while back when Naga asked:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><EM><FONT face="times new roman,times">Hi,<BR><BR>My application has an edit box in a dialog. Who will get the message WM_CHAR when user enters characters or tab etc.. when the focus is on the edit box?<BR><BR>I am presuming that the message WM_CHAR will come to parent. But it seems that message is not coming to parent.<BR><BR>Do I need to handle WM_CHAR messages for child controls separately in their own dialog proc?<BR><BR>Can’t we handle them in the parent, Dialog proc itself?<BR><BR>Regards,<BR>Nag</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>I shudder to think about what it would mean if one's parent's were notified about all of the&nbsp;random characters one had spending time in one's room -- I didn't even always do this when I lived in their house, if you must know!</P>
<P>Thus my response to Naga's question:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times">The EDIT box's own WNDPROC gets the WM_CHAR notification; this is the EDIT control's bread and butter, and like in life our parents don't have to be quite *that* involved with our core work....</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Now although the truth is that there are times that a parent can have a subtle effect on things, in Window just as in life, it is usually someone else that decides things.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">Like when Jeffrey asked the other day, based on a&nbsp;newsgroup thread:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P mce_keep="true"><FONT face="times new roman,times"><EM>My customer configured his Windows XP for Arabic using MUI, and we can see IE drawing its file open dialog mirrored.<BR><BR>Then, he called SetProcessDefaultLayout( LAYOUT_RTL) in his win32 C++ app, but still the file open dialog is drawn LTR, ie. not mirrored as we would like.(Everything is RTL except for the OPENFILENAME dialog) <BR><BR>Any ideas what more we need to do?<BR><BR>Thanks in advance!</EM></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P mce_keep="true">After a bunch of work, it turned out that the directionality of the hwndOwner window of the OPENFILENAME structure was the deciding factor for whether or not the dialog would be mirrored. </P>
<P mce_keep="true">Do we need better proof that our parents don't own us and have no say in the characters that live with us?</P>
<P mce_keep="true">Or does it all point to the immaturity of the windows themselves -- don't we look at phrases </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P mce_keep="true"><STRONG>I'm not a&nbsp;child for you to control the characters I hang out with!</STRONG> </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P mce_keep="true">or </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P mce_keep="true"><STRONG>I am not a child for you to control what direction my life takes!</STRONG> </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P mce_keep="true">and shake our heads at these children who just don't understand that we do not wish to hem our children in way such as this?</P>
<P mce_keep="true">On the other hand, I could simply be over anthropomorphizing an already way too over-extended metaphor to try to tie two disparate points together in a single&nbsp;blog.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">Yes, on reflection that is what is going on here. </P>
<P mce_keep="true">Never mind.... :-)</P>

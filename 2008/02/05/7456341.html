<P><EM><FONT color=#ff0000>This post brought to you in care of associative linkage --&nbsp;I know where it starts but no one knows where it will end! :-)</FONT></EM></P>
<P>So yesterday was the first day of <STRONG>Carnival</STRONG> in a bunch of places.</P>
<P>And&nbsp;tomorrow is <STRONG>Ash Wednesday</STRONG> in a whole bunch of places.</P>
<P>And today?</P>
<P>Today is&nbsp;<STRONG>Pancake Day</STRONG> in Lithuania!</P>
<P>Now it is the kind of name that could easily inspire all kinds of crazy stories (or you could read the Wikipedia article about it <A class="" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancake_Day" mce_href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancake_Day">here</A>&nbsp;and skip the drama).</P>
<P>Or you could have a drink, remember fondly <A class="" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oolong_(rabbit)" mce_href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oolong_(rabbit)">Oolong</A>, and then say those immortal words Oolong was famous for.</P>
<P>If you aren't sure what I mean, then you can just say </P>
<P><STRONG><FONT size=4>I have no idea what you're talking about... so here's a bunny with a pancake on it's head.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>and not only will you have fulfilled your need to ,look me squarely in eye and say</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT size=5>HUH?</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>But you will also have said the words Oolong was famously associated with!</P>
<P><IMG src="http://heresabunnywithapancakeonitshead.com/bunny_pancake.jpg"></P>
<P>Now obviously <STRONG>Shrove Tuesday</STRONG> has nothing to do with the famous images of Oolong, but even so, Outlook's inspired view of the week in five day view </P>
<P><IMG height=254 src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/pancake.png" width=887></P>
<P>made it all come together, for me.</P>
<P>So let's remember <A class="" href="http://heresabunnywithapancakeonitshead.com/" mce_href="http://heresabunnywithapancakeonitshead.com/">Oolong</A>, everyone....</P>
<P>I wonder what <EM>he</EM> did when he didn't know what people were talking about, which I imagine was fairly often since he was just a bunny.</P>
<P>It seems slightly egotistical to show a picture of himself each time, doesn't it?</P>
<P>Poor Oolong. I wonder if he ever just took a bite out of the pancake, like on Pancake Day? He could then just stop eating them and tell people he gave them up for Lent....</P>
<P>(<EM>Lent remind me of forty days which reminds me of the ark which reminds me that Noah was an asshole -- Martin Cruz Smith was the most famous person to suggest it, but he was actually the second person to point it out to me, the first being a rabbi several years ago&nbsp;who was pointing out to me that we always learn the wrong lessons from sacred texts -- and that sometimes you make the argument, even if it with someone you aren't supposed to disagree with!</EM>)</P>
<P>Not that I think one should disagree with someone who has a pancake on their head.</P>
<P>Though speaking of that Renko book, I wonder whether "<STRONG>Was Noah a carpenter or a sailor, and why?</STRONG>" would make a good interview question? Probably not.</P>
<P>Though I'd virtually hire anyone who had not read the book or found the reference but had a defensible answer to the question on this fine <STRONG>Pancake Day</STRONG> we are having....</P>

<P>Over in the Suggestion Box, Amie asked:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times"><EM>What exactly does Ctrl - V stand for and how did it come about.. besides the fact that the V is near X and C? What does the V stand for in the shortcut? Can someone help me figure this one out please?<BR><BR>Thank you!<BR><BR>-- Amie (:</EM></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>And regular reader Jan Kučera responded (also in the Suggestion Box, where he had moments ago&nbsp;posted an unrelated question that I have not gotten to yet:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times">To Amie regarding Ctrl+V meaning:<BR><BR>... 'Paste' in Czech is 'Vložit' ... &nbsp;so ... maybe? ..hm? :-D</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Cute!</P>
<P>But I am inclined to doubt that the Czech language had much to do with it. :-)</P>
<P>As far as I can see, both CTRL+X and CTRL+V owe their ubiquitous assignments to their proximity to CTRL+C, which is a very sensible choice for the <STRONG>copy</STRONG> operation....</P>
<P>Sorry about that, Jan!</P>

<p>AFAIR, these conventions came from the Mac; &#222;e Olde Windows Way back in 3.1 was Shift+Ins for Paste, Ctrl+Ins for Copy, and Shift+Del for Cut. &nbsp;Amusingly, both sets of conventions </p></div>
<p><strong>Mike Dimmick</strong> on 13 Feb 2008 12:45 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>I've always used the aid that X looks like scissors, so Cut, C is the first letter of Copy, and V looks like inserting something between two other things, so Paste. Or at least I did to begin with, 15 years of using Windows since they were added in 3.1 has rather drilled them into my memory.</p>
<p>I could never remember the Ctrl/Shift+Ins/Del pairings from IBM Common User Access. Shamelessly stealing the Apple keybindings was a great idea ;)</p>
<p>And of course Z is the last letter of the alphabet (well, in English anyway) so is an appropriate key to go back to the last version.</p></div>
<p><strong>Rick Schaut</strong> on 13 Feb 2008 1:14 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Back in the old pen-and-paper days of editing documents, people marked the location of inserted text with a &quot;V&quot; in a slightly super-scripted position relative to the base line. &nbsp;I suspect the Ctrl-V for Insert might well have had something to do with that practice.</p></div>

<p><strong>Arie Roos</strong> on 14 Feb 2008 7:54 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>And most likely at the time of defining CTRL+V, CTRL+P was already in use for Print</p></div>
<p><strong>Scott</strong> on 14 Feb 2008 9:18 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Of course, when Microsoft borrowed the Macintosh keybindings for cut, copy, and paste, they didn't have a Command key, so they used the Control instead. &nbsp;This leads to a very unfortunate conflict in terminal programs, where Ctrl-C means stop the current command.</p></div>
<p><strong>Jan Kučera</strong> on 30 May 2008 4:19 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><P>I can't help myself, but still using the Shift+Delete, Ctrl+Insert and Shi<FONT color=#ff0000><STRONG>f</STRONG></FONT>t+Insert... and I am 23! :) And I really really hope they will work forever, or at least as long as I will be using keyboard for input. ;-)</P>
<P>Do you use Ctrl+X,C,V? How does it happen that one migrates after so many years?</P></div>

<p><strong>Ulla</strong> on 3 Sep 2012 4:43 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>V stands for &quot;verbatim&quot;. You Ctrl C it for &quot;copy&quot; and then what you copied is &quot;verbatim&quot; copied somewhere else when you hit &quot;Ctrl V&quot;.</p>

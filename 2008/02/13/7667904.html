<P>More fun from <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/01/16/7101598.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/01/16/7101598.html"><STRONG>that India trip</STRONG></A>....</P>
<P>One of the interesting things that can happen as a government works to keep language in the minds and hearts of people is that the language ends up getting used. The results can be interesting or amusing or even dangerous (thinking back to previous blogs about <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/05/10/415993.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/05/10/415993.html"><STRONG>Irish</STRONG></A> and <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/01/17/513418.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/01/17/513418.html"><STRONG>Welsh</STRONG></A>) but there are even more fascinating concepts when you involve Indic languages like Kannada (a-la-<A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/02/02/7383730.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/02/02/7383730.html"><STRONG>Bangalore or Bengaluru (Bengalūru)?</STRONG></A>).</P>
<P>Let's take a look at the back of the buses in Bengalūru for a moment....</P>
<P>Like vehicles around the world, they have license plates. But let's take a closer look:</P>
<P><IMG height=669 src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/kannadabus.png" width=826></P>
<P><EM>I was seeing these license plates all week and every time I did I scrambled for my camera but kept missing getting the picture all week -- this one I got on the way to the airport, it was the closest to non-blurry that I was able to get from the back of a moving taxi!</EM></P>
<P>On the left side is the license plate like you see on vehicles throughout the city. But if you look on the right, there is that same license plate, using the Kannada script and language!</P>
<P>Now this is fascinating on several levels -- first and foremost it is the sort of thing that makes the idea of <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/10/02/783066.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/10/02/783066.html"><STRONG>internationalizing StrCmpLogicalW</STRONG></A> of more than just theoretical interest!</P>
<P>Then there is taking&nbsp;0123456789 in Kannada when you get ೦೧೨೩೪೫೬೭೮೯ and by coincidence 01 looks like ON and 1019 looks like NONE. :-)</P>
<P>But there is another interesting thing that happens for the language. Do you see it?</P>
<P>Just like with Hebrew, where IBM becomes <STRONG><FONT size=4>יבמ</FONT></STRONG> rather than <STRONG><FONT size=4>יבם</FONT></STRONG> (mentioned previously <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/09/02/4712047.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/09/02/4712047.html"><STRONG>here</STRONG></A>),&nbsp;KA becomes not <FONT size=4><STRONG>ಕ</STRONG></FONT> (KANNADA LETTER KA) or <FONT size=4><STRONG>ಕಾ</STRONG></FONT> (ending with a KANNADA&nbsp;VOWEL SIGN&nbsp;AA) or even <FONT size=4><STRONG>ಕೆ</STRONG></FONT> (ending with a KANNADA VOWEL SIGN E), it is&nbsp;instead ending with <FONT size=4><STRONG>ಎ</STRONG></FONT> (an independent KANNADA LETTER E) -- which gives hints on both how it is pronounced if one is a native speaker, but clearly making sure people don't make it a single word KA but instead something that sounds like KAY-AAY (the KANNADA A and AA sound more like AHH than AAY, as opposed to the E).</P>
<P>Do you also see how that KANNADA LETTER E surrounds the second word in order to allow the letters to be pronounced not as a word but as individual letters, and how it seems possibly happier not using <FONT size=4><STRONG>ೞ</STRONG></FONT> (KANNADA LETTER FA) but instead something closer maybe to <FONT size=4><STRONG>ಫ</STRONG></FONT> (KANNADA LETTER PHA)? </P>
<P>A native speaker can probably explain better about what is going on here exactly, but one thing is clear -- the license plate really is quite a literal transliteration of English pronunciations into Kannada. That is indescribably cool, in my opinion!</P>

<p>Fascinating -- I wonder what made &quot;aay-ph&quot; a better choice than &quot;aay-f&quot; for the letter &quot;F&quot; here? :-)</p>
<p>Language rocks.</p>

<p>see <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://babelstone.blogspot.com/2006/03/unicode-character-names-part-3-name-by.html">http://babelstone.blogspot.com/2006/03/unicode-character-names-part-3-name-by.html</a> for a list of other misnamed characters.</p>
<p>Since Kannada doesn't have a native /f/ sound, they make do by using /ph/ as their closest approximation. It's actually quite common among Indic systems to use some sort of /p/ with some sort of modifier, such as nukta or aytham to represent /f/ (or similarly for other foreign sounds).</p>
<p>Just two cents from an irregular reader.</p>
<p>Armchair linguistics rocks! :D</p></div>

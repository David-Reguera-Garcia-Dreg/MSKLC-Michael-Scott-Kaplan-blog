<P>I have Lhermitte's sign.</P>
<P>It is named for the French neurologist <A class="" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Lhermitte" mce_href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Lhermitte">Jean Lhermitte</A>, who actually has quire a few different medically interesting doodads bearing his name:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Lhermitte's sign</LI>
<LI>Lhermitte's peduncular hallucinosis</LI>
<LI>Lhermitte's syndrome</LI>
<LI>Lhermitte-Comil-Quesnel syndrome</LI>
<LI>Lhermitte-Duclos syndrome</LI>
<LI>Lhermitte-Lévy syndrome</LI>
<LI>Lhermitte-McAlpine syndrome</LI>
<LI>Lhermitte-Trelles syndrome</LI></UL>
<P>You can look at that Wikipedia article about him if you want to see the descriptions of them.</P>
<P>The weirdest one for me is the first one (aka Barber Chair syndrome), which is <A class="" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lhermitte%27s_sign" mce_href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lhermitte%27s_sign">described</A> as:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><EM>...an electrical sensation that runs down the back and into the limbs, and is produced by bending the neck forward. The sign suggests a lesion of the dorsal columns of the cervical cord or of the caudal medulla.</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Although it is called a sign, it really is a symptom (it is based on a patient's description rather than something a doctor could independently note) but the name has been around for a shade under 100 years so it is unlikely to change.</P>
<P>It is one of my first symptoms of multiple sclerosis, and to be honest one that I remember from several years before my initial diagnosis.</P>
<P>And it is still with me even today, though only when I cause it by bending my neck forward. Usually for me it only runs down to my fingertips though during acute exacerbations (both&nbsp;genuine and inspired by subclinical illness) I sometimes feel it down my legs as well. It kind of screws up the whole "making a person's toes tingle" notion for me, as it is kind of like my waking state, and if I kiss a person of typical ideal kissing height for me while standing up then I will feel tingling in my limbs independent of how good or bad the kiss is.</P>
<P><EM>Though I recommend leaning me against something or I will fall since I usually close my eyes when I kiss, which causes another sign I'll talk about another time....</EM></P>
<P>It is particularly bad at the moment, which is why I am writing about it.</P>

<p>It's funny, having both symptoms at different times (the constant dysethesias and the ones caused by neck flexion) all I can honestly say is the one that is worst is the one I have at that moment (which is a fancy of way of saying I can't really seem to properly judge which is worse!).</p>
<p>Given how I feel about other Sx, the impact on the long term status of the disease seems significant though is not so much of an issue for MS as it can be for diabetes....</p>
<p>Either way, we do share a symptom. :-)</p>

I have been searching for a long time to find out why I have been shocking myself, badly, I might add and I did not even have to bend my neck to do this....I would have hundreds of shocks a day and the doctors to not seem to care what is causing it! I have been to many doctors going on 5 years. They do not care I have been in pain for this long either...Nothing really shows up in blood work or any other labs...they only want numbers..... Now I have something! Just wait! I have been loosing my eye sight badly as well. Seeing green shades on white...then everything goes back to normal after a few weeks...by the time I get an appointment! I wish I could cram this down every web site that assicoates this sign only with the bending of the neck! &nbsp;Thank you Thank you Thank you!</p></div>
<p><strong>amanda</strong> on 6 Oct 2010 2:47 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>i have no idea why i get this symptom but it happens every day. MY TESTS ARE NORMAL BUT I HAVE NUMB BODY PARTS AND CONTINUOUS SHOCKING SENSATIONS WHEN BENDING MY NECK. i TRY NOT TO DWELL ON IT BUT I KNOW THE DOCTORS ARE MISSING THE TRUE REASON FOR IT. WHO KNOWS AND IM SICK OF TESTS SO I GUESS I WILL JUST LIVE AND HOPEFULLY IT WILL ALL FLY AWAY</p>

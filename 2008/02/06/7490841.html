<P>Once you get a reputation among your readers, you can find them emailing you as they run into items of interest on the web, or just the opportunity to talk about your own oddities....</P>
<P>Like when fellow MSFTie Kim Hamilton will claim in Facebook that I'm the most likely to <STRONG>have the answer to my obscure glob loc question in his blog</STRONG> or to <STRONG>have a unicode character of the day in his blog</STRONG>.</P>
<P>Or when an xkcd comic comes out that has a Unicode joke in it and you get six emails about it within five hours (Tobi, you were actually first!).</P>
<P>Here it is:</P>
<P><A class="" href="http://xkcd.com/380/" mce_href="http://xkcd.com/380/"><IMG title="U+FDD0 is actually Unicode for the eye of the basilisk, though for safety reasons no font actually renders it." alt=Emoticon src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/emoticon.png" border=0></A></P>
<P mce_keep="true">(Click on the comic to go the site, and as with all xkcd comics, the ToolTip is critical to the joke!)</P>
<P mce_keep="true">Within NameList.txt, there is a nice explanation of them:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P mce_keep="true"><FONT face="consolas,lucida console,courier new,courier" size=1>@ Noncharacters<BR>@+ These codes are intended for process-internal uses, but are not permitted for interchange.<BR>FDD0 &lt;not a character&gt;<BR>FDD1 &lt;not a character&gt;<BR>FDD2 &lt;not a character&gt;<BR>FDD3 &lt;not a character&gt;<BR>FDD4 &lt;not a character&gt;<BR>FDD5 &lt;not a character&gt;<BR>FDD6 &lt;not a character&gt;<BR>FDD7 &lt;not a character&gt;<BR>FDD8 &lt;not a character&gt;<BR>FDD9 &lt;not a character&gt;<BR>FDDA &lt;not a character&gt;<BR>FDDB &lt;not a character&gt;<BR>FDDC &lt;not a character&gt;<BR>FDDD &lt;not a character&gt;<BR>FDDE &lt;not a character&gt;<BR>FDDF &lt;not a character&gt;<BR>FDE0 &lt;not a character&gt;<BR>FDE1 &lt;not a character&gt;<BR>FDE2 &lt;not a character&gt;<BR>FDE3 &lt;not a character&gt;<BR>FDE4 &lt;not a character&gt;<BR>FDE5 &lt;not a character&gt;<BR>FDE6 &lt;not a character&gt;<BR>FDE7 &lt;not a character&gt;<BR>FDE8 &lt;not a character&gt;<BR>FDE9 &lt;not a character&gt;<BR>FDEA &lt;not a character&gt;<BR>FDEB &lt;not a character&gt;<BR>FDEC &lt;not a character&gt;<BR>FDED &lt;not a character&gt;<BR>FDEE &lt;not a character&gt;<BR>FDEF &lt;not a character&gt;</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P mce_keep="true">Kind of puts it all in perspective, trying to describe the need to capture text that explains a joke in a comic strip that contains the non-characters&nbsp;in order describe them, in plain text, huh? :-)</P>
<P mce_keep="true">&nbsp;</P>
<P mce_keep="true"><EM><FONT color=#ff00ff>Sponsorship of blogs by non-characters within Unicode is still a very controversial issue here</FONT></EM></P>

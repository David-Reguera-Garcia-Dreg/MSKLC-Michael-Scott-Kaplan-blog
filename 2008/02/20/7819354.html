<P>Over in the Suggestion Box, regular reader Jeroen Ruigrok van der Werven asked:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><EM><FONT face="times new roman,times">Michael,<BR><BR>any idea why MSDN offers all language packs for Office 2007, yet does not offer the multi-language one? Doing testing on this front makes installing a bit tedious (especially since you cannot just launch the MSIs from the different proofing directories --for installing the newer IMEs-- since it will give you a "Error 1713. Setup cannot install one of the required products for Microsoft IME (...)"). Thankfully I managed to find out about the LAUNCHEDBYSETUPEXE=1 trick to pass to the MSI on the command line, but it sure is annoying.</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P mce_keep="true">Of course I can't really speak for anyone on the Office side of the business, but I know from listening to people talk about the (not entirely dissimilar) Windows language pack that what has driven these particular SKUs.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">It really wasn't the MSDN style environment, which is not really at all what they are about.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">They are about a particular interesting deployment scenario -- OEMs who want to build multiple languages into a single image in order to deploy languages that are expected to be used together, to people who pay the extra money to get that kind of a SKU....</P>
<P mce_keep="true">And clearly they aren't slicing up the pieces the way you are related to the IMEs, right? I suspect over time those workarounds will stop working since they wanted those this to not fail.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">If you look at white papers like <A class="" href="http://technet2.microsoft.com/Office/en-us/library/9b5b2d78-66a7-4b0d-bbf1-788036e230e21033.mspx?mfr=true" mce_href="http://technet2.microsoft.com/Office/en-us/library/9b5b2d78-66a7-4b0d-bbf1-788036e230e21033.mspx?mfr=true">Customize a multilanguage deployment of the 2007 Office system</A> and others under the <A class="" href="http://technet2.microsoft.com/Office/en-us/library/9b5b2d78-66a7-4b0d-bbf1-788036e230e21033.mspx?mfr=true" mce_href="http://technet2.microsoft.com/Office/en-us/library/9b5b2d78-66a7-4b0d-bbf1-788036e230e21033.mspx?mfr=true">Deploying 2007 Internationally</A> node, it is pretty clear who their targets are (by looking at who they made it easiest for by giving them useful instructions!).</P>
<P mce_keep="true">Of course the people who are building such images can always test the ones they create, but making it easier for everyone else to do so doesn't necessarily seem like a scenario they are going out of their way to make easier. Kind of like they aren't against it but they aren't jumping all over making it easy to do.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">Now again I have no idea if this is what either Windows or Office has in mind here, and I don't get invited to those kinds of meetings. But from a priorities standpoint it is what things look like to me.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">So, to properly "sell" the importance of the scenario, you probably have to explain why it is important to you, and then if that is compelling then perhaps it will become easier....</P>

<P>So the other day I noticed a friend of mine had added a <STRONG>My Blogs</STRONG> application to their <STRONG>facebook</STRONG> profile. I figured that with very small amount of facebook activities I do I needed way to fill my mini-feed without having to do actual work -- so something that would add my blog post every day would be awesome!</P>
<P>Unfortunately, it was neither platform double suede nor disco lemonade.</P>
<P>Because while <STRONG>facebook</STRONG>'s mini-profile supports Unicode just fine, the <STRONG>My Blogs</STRONG> facebook application created by <STRONG>Space Program</STRONG> (a company with a <STRONG>facebook</STRONG> profile claiming they "<EM>...make cool stuff</EM>" and a website tagline claims that they&nbsp;focus on&nbsp;"<EM>...delivering extremely high quality products and services to make IT life easier</EM>") is <STRONG><EM>not</EM></STRONG> supporting Unicode. The screenshot:</P>
<P><IMG height=744 src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/facebook01.png" width=815></P>
<P>Note the <STRONG>My Blogs</STRONG> application in the middle that puts question marks in for all of the non-CP_ACP characters, and the same entires in the mini-feed on the right that put the actual Unicode characters in.</P>
<P><EM>And yes, the picture of me is my avatar,&nbsp;David Sim's&nbsp;delightful character Cerebus the aardvark. He is better looking than me, and has no smile issues since he never smiles!</EM></P>
<P>Anyway, I am kind of torn at this point.</P>
<P>Should I give them a chance to fix this? You may have seen near the bottom of mu <STRONG>mini-feed</STRONG> that I gave them the feedback on this issue -- perhaps I should give them a chance to address the problem.</P>
<P>On the other hand, I could just make their application invisible while still letting the minifeed pick up the entries. It just seems kind of obnoxious to not give them some more profile space, without even seeing if they planned to do something here (if I hide them then when will I ever see their improvements!).</P>
<P>Not supporting Unicode does not make a company evil; it merely&nbsp;suggests the company&nbsp;is being narrow-minded. </P>
<P>And not doing so in a free application that will never make the authoring company much money also doesn't make a company evil; it merely&nbsp;suggests the company is being lazy.</P>
<P>To disprove both of those suggestions, we'll have to see if they address the inherent limitation in their facebook plug-in....</P>
<P>I've can wait to see if they step up here!</P>
<P><EM>If they want help they can ask; As regular readers know, I am all about Unicode enabling!</EM></P>

<p>I don't know if this is still a problem, but if they keep changing how facebook interprets app output it's little surprise that apps would end up doing strange things like this.</p></div>

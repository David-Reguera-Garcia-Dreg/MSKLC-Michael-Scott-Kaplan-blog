<p><font color="#ff0000"><i>Warning: Excessive PASS puns follow; if you don't like that sort of thing, then do not PASS...</i></font><br></p><p>It was one of those fun conversations that I find myself in from time to time.</p><p>Over IM, I was talking to my friend Rachel (a very smart ASPNET developer I know who rather delightfully has a properly spelled last name <b>Appel</b> rather than those more fruity types of names out there, if you know what I mean).</p><p>We were just kind of <b>PASS</b>ing the time.</p><p>I asked her (in <b>PASS</b>ing) whether she was going to <b>PASS</b> (I was referring to the upcoming conference put on by the <b>PASS</b>, the <a href="http://www.sqlpass.org/" mce_href="http://www.sqlpass.org/">Professional Association for SQL Server</a>).</p><p>She told me that due to the dates in question, she was pretty sure she'd have to <b>PASS</b> this time.<br></p><p>I explained that I was given a <b>PASS</b> for <b>PASS</b>, working in the Ask the Experts area.</p><p>She couldn't <b>PASS</b> up the opportunity to ask, "When is <b>PASS</b>?"</p><p>The dates were, I explained, "The <b>PASS</b> Summit is November 18th-21st in Seattle."</p><p>"Oh, I'll definitely have to <b>PASS</b>, I have client work I have to do then."</p><p>"You're going to <b>PASS</b> on <b>PASS</b>?" I asked.</p><p>"I think i'll have to <b>PASS</b> on <b>PASS</b>, even if you could get me a <b>PASS</b> to <b>PASS</b>."</p><p>"Bummer. I probably shouldn't try to get you a <b>PASS</b> to <b>PASS</b> anyway. People might think it inappropriate -- like I was trying to make a <b>PASS</b> at you or something!"<br></p><p>"Nash, they know me. I could probably get my own <b>PASS</b> to <b>PASS</b>, if I didn't have to <b>PASS</b> on <b>PASS</b>. I do have that client work to do."</p><p>"Yeah, plus those boarding <b>PASS</b>es don't pay for themselves."</p><p>"That too."</p><p>"Okay, as excuses go it is a pretty good one. I'll let it <b>PASS</b>."</p><p>It went on a bit longer with <b>PASS</b> puns, though we never made it to the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXY9TuuwyL8" target="_blank" mce_href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXY9TuuwyL8">NONE SHALL <b>PASS</b></a> scene from <b>Monty Python and the Holy Grail</b>, though I suspect that was because I didn't think of it until later.</p><p>Though as a point of fact, unlike the black knight, way over 3000 people will <b>PASS</b>, to go to <b>PASS</b> -- and not <b>PASS</b> on <b>PASS</b>.</p><p>It is an awesome SQL Server conference and I promise that I have all of the <b>PASS</b> puns out of my system now. I promise. :-)<br></p><p>If you will be there, be sure to look for me on my iBOT with the <b>I'm a PC</b> stickers on each side....</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><font color="#ff00ff"><i>This blog brought to you by</i><font size="5"> âŽ‘ </font><i>(<a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2391" mce_href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2391">U+2391</a>, aka PASSIVE-PULL-DOWN-OUTPUT SYMBOL)</i></font><br></p>

<p>More news out of the PDC. :-)</p><p>I had a few people point out after they saw the talk I pointed to in <b><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/10/30/9023605.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/10/30/9023605.html">From ____ to ____ to MUI to ELS -- World Ready @ the PDC!</a></b> (the one that I liked the content but didn't care for the title, and I though could have used more material) the one called <b>Windows 7: Writing World-Ready Applications</b>, another very interesting talk.</p><p>One called <b>Windows 7: Introducing Direct2D and DirectWrite</b>, a presentation you can see <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/pdc2008/PC18/" mce_href="http://channel9.msdn.com/pdc2008/PC18/">right here</a>.</p><p>Now people who would talk to me aren't gonna go ga-ga about Direct2D in front of me, sinc they know that it is not the sort of thing that impresses me.</p><p>On a good day I'll nod and smile and then move on to the next thing.</p><p>On a bad day I'll snarl out something deprecating, like <b>they sell that crap at the airport</b> before moving on to something I find more interesting.</p><p>A man who lives so much of his life in source code and DOS (well, CMD) prompts is just not gonna always get excited every time you have a new faster way to do cool graphics.</p><p>Nothing personal, but I am not their target customer, and they kind of <b>do</b> sell that crap at the airport, from my point of view. :-)</p><p>The people who pointed out the talk to me, they were talking about <b>DirectWrite</b>.</p><p>They <b>don't</b> sell that crap at the airport.... <br></p><p>This is something I do plan to talk about more at some point, though most likely not so much right away since no one has really had a chance to look at it yet.</p><p>For now, I'm going to be cautiously optimistic and withhold any other judgment.</p><p>I have been burned getting too enthused about this kind of thing before. In retrospect, I found reasons to be less excited, as I have pointed out in stuff on text stacks in <b><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/11/19/6386152.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/11/19/6386152.html">Khmer, and I'll tell you about all the text stacks</a></b>, and the recent <b><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/10/24/9014653.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/10/24/9014653.html">Silverlight as Esau: selling its implementation for a pot of interface</a></b>.</p><p>The Khmer thing coming up in both of them is coincidence; I'm talking about deeper issues.</p><p>And when I do get around to assessing DirectWrite, it will be on the basis of my core issues that you have heard me blog me about in the past:</p><ul><li>CJK text handling</li><li>vertical text</li><li>script coverage -- both breadth and depth<br></li><li>complex script support</li><li>ease of use</li><li>interoperability issues</li><li>parity or the lack thereof</li><li>the generic question about yet another entry in the collection of text stacks</li><li>what's missing -- what scripts, what languages, what scenarios</li><li>the downlevel story</li><li>the customers</li><li>the standards/Unicode/community story - de facto and de jure conformance and leadership</li><li>the managed/native split<br></li></ul><p>All of these issues are huge in my mind, and not very many of them make sense to beat up a pre-beta for, and not that many would be top of my list in a beta, either.</p><p>But I'll talk about them. and how issues I have talked about before stack up against the new kid on the block.</p><p><br></p><p><font color="#ff00ff"><i>This blog has no Unicode sponsor yet, but lots of characters are jockeying for position for the upcoming ones....</i></font> <br></p>

<P>I note that you interest lies in:</P>
<P>"what's missing -- what scripts, what languages, what scenarios"</P>
<P>In that light I wanted to know if you could shed some lights on why Myanmar Font is mentioned as system supported in the DirectWrite documentation, while in fact it's not there in the system? Thanks. </P></div>

I asked him. "That's just the first part!"</p><p>"Okay, you're the boss."</p><p>The code had to be good, though.</p><p>Because the IBOT, unlike the scooter, has no key.</p><p>I leasrned very early on not to leave the scooter in the hallway at work with the key in it.</p><p>Nobody would steal it, but joyrides were certainly not beyond them....</p><p>So with no key, I needed the activation code to be complicated enough that no one would be able to just get it.<br></p><p>It was actually a scene out of Ocean's Thirteen that I was reminded of:</p><blockquote><p><font face="times new roman,times">Rusty: Okay, where's Eugene's trapdoor?<br>Livingston: Under the Dragon, first machine on the left.<br>Rusty: Got it. What's the secret?<br>Livingston: Coin, 3 counts. Coin, 6 counts. 3 Coins, 5 counts. 2 Coins half count.<br>Rusty: Could you make it anymore complicated?<br>Livingston: That's just the first sequence....</font></p></blockquote><p>That's the sc ene. The complicated set of instructions to enable the "make the slot machines pay out" feature they conspired to get into the casino.</p><p>Okay, perhaps slightly less at stake here. But it's the same principle....</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><font color="#ff00ff"><i>This blog broight to you by</i><font size="7"> âŽ‡ </font><i>(<a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2387" mce_href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2387">U+2387</a>, aka ALTERNATIVE KEY SYMBOL)</i></font><br></p>

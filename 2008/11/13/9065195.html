<p>The problem may be in BIOS or some hidden system boot up language setting on the computer since only the system boot up display is affected be it booting from the harddisk or from a Linux LiveCD.</p>
<p>Windows XP or Linux is still in English after booting up.</p>
<p>Anyway thanks for your advice.</p></div>

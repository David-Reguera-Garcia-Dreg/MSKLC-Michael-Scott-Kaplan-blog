<P>Microsoft tends to get criticized, no matter what they (by which I mean we) do.</P>
<P>They (by which I mean customers) hate that the default install the additional IME, keyboard, font, and code page files(ref: <B><A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/05/27/422458.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/05/27/422458.html">What isn't in the default install for NLS</A></B>).<BR></P>
<P>But of course someone else (customer again) would be disturbed when we (Microsoft) "fixed" this, concerned that <B><A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/10/10/813347.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/10/10/813347.html">The fonts directory is freaking huge in Vista</A></B>.</P>
<P>And then of course other people (customers again) are installing more fonts then any human could really want and <B><A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/11/11/9059132.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/11/11/9059132.html">trying their best at blowing their font cache</A></B>. Obviously if several hundred fonts is too much then several hundreds of hundreds of them would be stratospheric.</P>
<P>Anyway, when we (Microsoft) remove the instructions to install files conditionally since we (Microsoft) no longer need to install them, people (customers again) point out <B><A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/01/04/1392691.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/01/04/1392691.html">the problems of the smaller intl.inf</A></B>.</P>
<P>And then just the other day, someone else noticed you could install code page files anymore, and asked urgently:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times">...customer has an application that uses iso 8859-7&nbsp; (WinXP and Win2000); after upgrading to Vista business he sees no option for elot-928 (iso 8859-7 ) and he is saying that the codepage has been removed and has been looking for it and ways to set it on Vista.</FONT> <BR></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Ah, the concern was that because someone noticed that the additional code page install option had been removed, and they assumed this meant we had removed the code page.</P>
<P>I suppose we could have cluttered the user interface up with the note that you don't have to install the code pages because they are there, but I think the right call was made there.</P>
<P>But it does seem challenging sometimes to do the work to address a customer concern....<BR></P>
<P>The happy note is that for the application in question the behavior will be better. Though clearly this does not always impact customer behavior. :-)<BR></P>

<p>Err... Stratospheric, or Catastrophic? :)</p></div>

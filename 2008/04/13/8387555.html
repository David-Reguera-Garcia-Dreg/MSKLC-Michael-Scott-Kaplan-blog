<P>So it started with the song <STRONG>Tail O' the Twister</STRONG> by Chagall Guevara (well, by Steve Taylor) that made it onto the CD but not the cassette of the <STRONG>Pump Up the Volume</STRONG> soundtrack.</P>
<P>Especially the way I connected the look on Liz Phair's face on the cover of her eponymous album that I had the autograph on:</P>

<P>Now the look on her face is not a come hither one at all. It is (as Steve Taylor described in the song):</P>

<P><STRONG>A barstool yawn to a stuttered come on, it's a dirt road rut, she said 'button up mister'</STRONG></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>You know, kind of an "I'm looking, but you're not all that" sort of look. A look which, as I <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/07/31/684908.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/07/31/684908.html"><STRONG>mentioned</STRONG></A>, I have seen before,&nbsp;as a few&nbsp;women have had it in the past looking at me. :-)</P>
<P>Like just last night at Allison's Bat Mitzvah party, when I explained the look to my cousin Alexis (Coop to many who do not get distracted by <STRONG>The O.C.</STRONG> reference, and Lexie to family <EM>and no one else</EM>), and she spontaneously came up with the following (by spontaneous I mean no direction as to where to put her head or anything):</P>
<P><IMG height=574 src="http://blogs.msdn.com/photos/michkap/images/8416424/original.aspx" width=524></P>
<P>Lexie lives in New York now and is keeping up quite nicely (something I was only okay at doing when I was there) and I imagine many young guys who do not pass muster get that same look.</P>
<P>At some point her shoe was thrown into a pile where guys at the party got to dance with whoever's shoe they got, and she made some 13 year old's night for being able to have a dance with an older woman. </P>
<P>I don't have that picture (someone else got it) but I'll probably be uploading a lot of the ones I do have evenually&nbsp;and then tagging various cousins in facebook (whether they are expecting it or not!). I just felt like this <STRONG>Tale&nbsp;O' Lex Twister</STRONG> moment had to be captured separately in this quite off-topic blog. :-)</P>

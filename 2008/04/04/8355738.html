<P>So anyhow, the other day developer Ben Karas (he of <A class="" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/benkaras/" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/benkaras/">The Great Flying Tortoise</A>) who I have mentioned <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/01/17/513418.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/01/17/513418.html"><STRONG>before</STRONG></A>, sent a fun "find the bug" code problem to one of those aliases inside Microsoft that gets those kinds of problems.</P>
<P>It had some interesting issues from my point of view so I thought I would ask the problem again here.</P>
<P><EM>If you internal to Microsoft and you answer the question anyway than you kind of&nbsp;officially suck -- though several issues were missed when the answers were given so if you were watching that thread but knew about bugs that never came up then you neatly manage to avoid suckage.</EM> :-)</P>
<P>So here we go. The question -- can you spot the bugs in this snippet?</P>

<p>What if lstrlen(x) == 0?</p></div>

<p>There seems to be one real problem and then a question about completeness.</p>
<p>1) If the program is in UNCODE, then aren't they using the wrong codes? &nbsp;Isn't FD/FE only for 8-bit latin/hebrew? &nbsp;The proper codes would be 200E and 200F.</p>
<p>2) Why are we only checking for LRM? &nbsp;I guess since we have already specified RTLREADING, then we are looking for the exception.</p></div>

<p>On one side I feel like commenting, on the other side I try to refrain and let it for potential interns.</p>
<p>Why spoil it for them? :-)</p></div>

<p><a id="8357740" href="#8357740">#</a> <strong>Mihai</strong> on 4 Apr 2008 2:02 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Ok, then here it is (the one I think you care about):</p>
<p>0xFD is LTR Mark in cp1256 (Arabic), not in Unicode. The code currently tests for &nbsp;&#253; :-)</p>
<p>And even using U+200E would not help much, because the LTR does not have to be the first/last character.</p></div>
<p><a id="8358434" href="#8358434">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 4 Apr 2008 5:34 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Okay, update for everyone -- </p>
<p>A few responses so far (four to the post and seven to the Contact link), but no one yet has found what Ben referred to as the &quot;main bug&quot; from the non-internationalization side (though I would tend to think of it as having certain internationalization consequences).</p>
<p>And although some people saw a specific valid problem and pointed it out, no one has suggested what the code ought to be doing. Though I am still hopeful that we will come up with more responses! :-)</p>

<p><a id="8358808" href="#8358808">#</a> <strong>Mihai</strong> on 4 Apr 2008 7:28 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Well, I only commented about &quot;the issues that interest me. :-)&quot;</p>
<p>There are other issues, like for instance:</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;item.pszText[lstrlen(item.pszText)-1]</p>
<p>Guess what happens for an empty string?</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;item.pszText[-1]</p>
<p>Oups!</p></div>
<p><a id="8363566" href="#8363566">#</a> <strong>John Hensley</strong> on 6 Apr 2008 2:25 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>The function is attempting to check for a unicode Left-to-right mark at the beginning and end of the item text string and then setting the SHDT_RTLREADING bit in textflags if the Left-to-right mark is not at the beginning or end of the string.</p>
<p>Bug 1 - &quot;item.pszText[lstrlen(item.pszText)-1] != '\xfd'))&quot; reads memory outside of the string if the string is zero length.</p>
<p>Bug 2 - SHDT_RTLREADING should not be set if the language does not support reading-order-alignment because WS_EX_RTLREADING will be ignored if the language does not support reading-order-alignment.</p>
<p>Bug 3 - GetStringTypeEx() should have been used to determine the directional information for the first and last characters in the string. This would eliminate bugs #2.</p>
<p>Possible bug 4 - Unicode strings can have bi-directional information embedded anywhere within the string not just at the beginning and end.</p>

<P>This may not apply if they set the right compiler flags but I think the default configuration in VC++ will have problems.</P></div>
<p><a id="8364783" href="#8364783">#</a> <strong>Michiel</strong> on 7 Apr 2008 5:00 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Just an assumption here, but does this code reuse &#253; for markup? It seems to use &quot;&#253;...&#253;&quot; as an indication that text should _not_ be Right-to-Left, despite the flag. </p>
<p>Now, that's definitely marked as a hack, and in RTL text I would not expect a string to contain &#253;, let alone at both ends.</p>
<p>Personally, I'd guess that both if-statements were added for this hack, and the textflags |= SHDT_RTLREADING was originally there. Now, if there is no text set, the SHDT_RTLREADING is no longer set even though it should (but since that's an MS-internal flag, I can't tell what other uses it has)</p></div>
<p><a id="8364879" href="#8364879">#</a> <strong>Arun Philip</strong> on 7 Apr 2008 5:55 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Couple of guesses: </p>
<p>* lstrlen assumes a null-terminated string </p>
<p>* Endianness of the data while checking for 0xFD? For the small fraction of Itaniums running in big-endian</p>
<p>* BIDI text can be entered within the text also by introducing 0xFD and 0xFE, so checking the beginning/end alone will not suffice</p>
<p>Aside: LtoR/RtoL -&gt; amusing alternative to LTR/RTL, although my mind first sees Tolkien references!</p></div>
<p><a id="8364958" href="#8364958">#</a> <strong>Mike Dimmick</strong> on 7 Apr 2008 6:28 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>a) Why are they looking for &#253;?</p>
<p>b) Why look for it at start and end of string only?</p>
<p>It looks like it's a special marker character, but I think they have flawed logic: they're expecting RTL text to appear in the buffer in LTR order, i.e. the first character printed (at the right-hand-end) appears at the right-hand-end of the buffer. Wrong. Text in a Unicode buffer always appears in reading order, even if that order happens to be right-to-left.</p>
<p>Let's, for the purpose of an example, give the latin/arabic numbers a right-to-left reading property. If the buffer was:</p>
<p>ABC 123 XYZ</p>
<p>it would be displayed as</p>
<p>ABC 321 XYZ.</p>
<p>If the buffer is right-to-left reading in the example, U+00FD always appears at the left.</p>
<p>In addition, the compiler will interpret \xFD with whatever code page it's interpreting the source file as, so it won't have a fixed meaning. I think there's also a chance it will sign-extend to U+FFFD (REPLACEMENT CHARACTER) rather than appear as U+00FD as the code does not use an L prefix on the character literal.</p></div>

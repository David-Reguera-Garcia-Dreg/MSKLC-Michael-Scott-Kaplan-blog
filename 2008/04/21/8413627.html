<P>It was just hours ago that I pointed out in <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/04/21/8413510.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/04/21/8413510.html"><STRONG>Windows doesn't let you choose the pinch hitter in digit substitution cases</STRONG></A> that there are even more problems with digit substitution than I had mentioned before.</P>
<P>Let's review:</P>
<UL>
<LI>The Context setting only works for PRIMARYLANGID(lcid) == LANG_FARSI and LANG_ARABIC (a Uniscribe thing)</LI>
<LI>The user interface in Regional and Language Options does not inform the user of this limitation</LI>
<LI>SetLocaleInfo doesn't fail when it is going to be ignored due to this limitation, either</LI>
<LI>You don't get to directly choose what digits get substituted; instead, a hardcoded list is used</LI></UL>
<P>Could it get worse?</P>
<P>Of course it can!</P>
<P>Let's look at this exciting case in Vista....</P>
<P>First we'll take a machine with an Arabic user locale and make sure that it is set to context:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/digitsub00.png"></P>
<P>Now with context definition:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><EM>the shape depends on the previous text in the same output</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>the meaning seems pretty clear. In fact you can even see it from the sample -- in an LTR context we'll get the regular Arabic-Indic digits<FONT size=1><SUP>1</SUP></FONT>, and in an RTL context we'll get Hindi digits<FONT size=1><SUP>2</SUP></FONT>.</P>
<P>Looks like it only cares about the user locale setting here for the purposes of the sample, right?</P>
<P>Now file paths, which start with drive letters, tend to start off with a rather LTR context, thus it is no surprise that we see Arabic digits:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/digitsub02.png"></P>
<P>and also in the breadcrumb bar view:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/digitsub01.png"></P>
<P>And that is kind of expected.</P>
<P>But then when we switch to an Arabic user interface language, while the full path looks the same:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/digitsub03.png"></P>
<P>The breadcrumb bar view is another story:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/digitsub04.png"></P>
<P>What happened? </P>
<P>Suddenly my "<EM>of course there is no difference in English</EM>" claim is refuted somewhat -- it is the correct and expected result, but for the wrong reason.</P>
<P>Because the Breadcrumb bar is&nbsp;looking at&nbsp;each chunk<SUP><FONT size=1>3</FONT></SUP> as if the context has been reset, and thus a folder that does not start with an&nbsp;LTR character is given RTL context, even if the overall path looks at things differently.</P>
<P>Also, it is not the user locale that runs the "context" setting, it is the user interface language. Despite the fact that the setting itself is tied to the user locale.</P>
<P>And if you have any setting <STRONG>other than</STRONG> context, then it is just the user locale. The implication is therefore that the context setting can have two very different levels of requirements:</P>
<OL>
<LI>The context underlying the whole string is expected to be an RTL one, and</LI>
<LI>The context of the beginning of the string itself is also expected to be an RTL one.</LI></OL>
<P>Another fun experiment might be to look at whether that Arabic/Farsi limitation applies to the user interface language requirement the same way that it applies to the user locale setting. And on the assumption that Regional and Language Options is not synthesizing the user locale dependency for the sample and that USER controls are affected, it might be good to understand why Explorer and the Shell seem to be working under this additional level, and what rules it is working under.</P>
<P>I'll give away the answer in case you haven't spotted it&nbsp;-- if the control itself is an RTL one, then it gets the RTL rules. For whatever reason, Explorer in this case has rules for what kind of controls to create that are based on rules ties to the user interface language. It is unclear whether it uses the Uniscribe-like LANG_FARSI/LANG_ARABIC rules or the NLS rules, though. Hopefully it is the latter which would be more correct even if also more confusing and less consistent (since even former Uniscribe owners often consider the Arabic/Farsi limitations to be bugs!).</P>
<P>Ironically, no one has been fast to fix these problems, in large part due to the fact that the <STRONG>context</STRONG> substitution setting is not widely used in these other places where it is broken. So there is not a huge scenario to make something work better that most people won't want anyway? :-)</P>
<P>No matter what, the whole area is still incredibly confusing and not-very-well-documented!</P>

<P>Over in the Suggestion Box, Bob Richmond mentioned:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><EM><FONT face="times new roman,times">Silverlight 2.0 - font and script support. Font embedding, native vs downloaded fonts etc. I'm not clear this has been fully thought through on the 2.0 Beta.</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>I must admit I find it more difficult to deal with items from the Suggestion Box that don't have a clear suggestion or question in them. :-)</P>
<OL>
<LI>Was Bob just giving his opinion but wasn't sure where to&nbsp;do it?</LI>
<LI>Maybe he wanted to see if I could do anything about it?</LI>
<LI>Or was he looking to see whether I agreed?</LI></OL>
<P>In response, I would say 1) okay, 2) probably not, and 3) both yes and no....</P>
<P>I was at the internal <STRONG>MS Text Summit</STRONG> recently, and there was a pretty clear presentation about the project plan&nbsp;over the next few versions. So I think that there is a plan and that things will get clearer here as the beta progresses. So although I do agree that things don't look to be&nbsp;fully thought out, I don't think things will stay that way. I do expect that things are going to get clearer here....</P>
<P>But if not, I'll definitely be talking about it as things get closer to release. :-)</P>

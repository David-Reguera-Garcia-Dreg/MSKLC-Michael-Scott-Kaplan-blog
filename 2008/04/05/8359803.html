<P>Sometimes not having the context is a good thing, in my opinion. Like when the words are things like:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><SPAN style="COLOR: #000000; FONT-FAMILY: MS Shell Dlg"><EM>I'm not anti us seeing each other, it just seems more difficult than is worthwhile at the moment. <BR><BR>P<SPAN style="COLOR: #000000; FONT-FAMILY: MS Shell Dlg">erhaps&nbsp;I really do want to be the type of friends that never see each other and never talk.</SPAN></EM></SPAN></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Not sure about the backstory, but it does seem at least a little bit sad....</P>
<P>It sounds like something very familiar -- like when a relationship is over and both people decide to "just be friends" -- this is usually the kind of friends they are, or end up being.</P>
<P>Though I guess the unusual bit in this case is that usually they don't admit it, even to themselves (let alone each other). </P>
<P>Ordinarily, it just kind of happens and then they run into each other in six months at a party or a show and ask each other how the other is doing, and then awkwardly skulk off. I could recite the piece in Love Monkey (the book) that tells the story, but I think everyone knows how it goes anyway.</P>
<P>Saying it like this explicitly hardly seems better -- at least with the random party there is a chance it could never happen. And one should never do today what one can put off until tomorrow!</P>

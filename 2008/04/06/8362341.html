<P>I actually don't fully understand what happened.</P>
<P>I was asked to report for jury duty.</P>
<P>No worries, I thought. All I cared about was whether or not all of the places I might have to be were accessible. I assumed I had to serve since I had already been excused once, pre-scooter.</P>
<P>So I asked in the bit of the form that gave me space to do so about the accessibility.</P>
<P>After hearing nothing back and with the date approaching, I called the number to ask directly and see what was up.</P>
<P>And I was told that I had been excused from jury duty.</P>
<P>I haven't decided how I feel about this just yet.</P>
<P>Part of me realizes that they have not just done me a favor, they have done both the prosecutor and the defendant a great favor as well -- if I were either of them I would probably be willing to burn a peremptory challenge on the likes of me, just to keep me off the panel.</P>
<P>But I am to be honest at a loss as to why it happened, or whether I should be upset or not.</P>
<P>I mean even ignoring the old joke about how unfair the whole system is since a "jury of one's peers" is unlikely to be found in finding twelve people who weren't smart enough to get out of jury duty, should I be offended?</P>
<P>Since I'd rather not actually serve, should I just be happy that I have been excused from doing so?</P>
<P>I should probably just forget about it.</P>

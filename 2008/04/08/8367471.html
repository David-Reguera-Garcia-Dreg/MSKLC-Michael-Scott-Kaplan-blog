<P>Over eight months ago when I blogged <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/08/02/4191351.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/08/02/4191351.html"><STRONG>Help prove that I am wrong, please</STRONG></A>, I honestly did hope that I was wrong and that this new <STRONG>microsoft.public.windows.international</STRONG> newsgroup would be a place where people who were not sure where to post would feel comfortable doing so.</P>
<P>Created at the behest of some folks on the MUI team who as far as I can tell haven't ever actually posted there (though perhaps they are monitoring), and in a group that has to do date never received any actual traffic, I think that at least for now it is safe to say that I was right and that this group is not necessary for the state purpose of providing a new less confusing alternative to the other internationalization-esque newsgroups, since no one has actually posted there.</P>
<P>There have been many new threads started by what appears to be new folk&nbsp;in other groups (mostly in <STRONG>microsoft.public.win32.progarmmer.international</STRONG>) and very few posts anywhere were uncertain or confused about where to post; people just seemed to have most past that issue without major quandries....</P>
<P>This suggests that</P>
<UL>
<LI>No group was needed, or</LI>
<LI>The name is just as non-intuitive as prior attempts, or</LI>
<LI>Both.</LI></UL>
<P>Perhaps it will catch on eventually, and if so I'll recant at that time.</P>
<P>But for now, it is clear that this group&nbsp;appears to be&nbsp;the latest in the grand tradition of unnecessary and poorly named "globalization-type" newsgroups....</P>

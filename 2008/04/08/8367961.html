<P>Conventional wisdom says that I should not allow myself to be pushed around, but recently I was given reason to possibly rethink that a bit....</P>
<P>I saw the movie <STRONG>Leatherheads</STRONG> over this last weekend with Kevin and Cathy, which was not too bad as movies go, and a meal afterward. </P>
<P>The most memorable thing that happened was not the movie.</P>
<P>And it was not the meal, either.</P>
<P>It was when the scooter ran out of battery power on the way back to where I had my car parked&nbsp;-- because once&nbsp;I put the scooter in neutral, <STRONG>Cathy</STRONG> is the one who pushed it all the way back to where the car was parked, while <STRONG>Kevin</STRONG> got doors and such. </P>
<P><EM>I did not question the division of labor here -- beggars can't be choosers!</EM></P>
<P>That'll teach me to use the small scooter on&nbsp;three different days without recharging in between, scooting all over town on the last one....</P>
<P>Anyway, I am charged back up again, and from now on any time a woman I respect wants to push me around I'll just look for where to sign up :-)</P>

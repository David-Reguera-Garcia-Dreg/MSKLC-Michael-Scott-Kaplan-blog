<P>I think my thoughts on the matter have been pretty much covered.</P>
<P>It is hard to say how things will go on that last point, as my opinions are fairly controversial and it is just as likely that they will not go in that direction....</P>
<P>But otherwise, the invention of letters that do not actually exist is quite powerful, as is the decision to ignore intuitive casing behavior or make unrealistic case mappings. Unicode has been doing it for some time and they seem pretty popular.</P>
<P>The whole issue makes me wonder about how Germany really feels about capital punishment, given all of the <STRONG>capital letter punishment</STRONG> they seem comfortable with. :-)</P>

<p><strong>ReallyEvilCanine</strong> on 16 Apr 2008 11:49 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Stupid, stupid, stupid. So when are we getting capital versions of other lower case-only ligatures like ﬀ, ﬁ, ﬂ and ﬃ? Modern Icelandic has a capital eth (&#208;) even though no word begins with it because there used to be swords that did. We have some of 'em, or at least their descendents. No word in German can or ever could begin with a double-ess (a ligature which has an odd history in and of itself). A capital &quot;&#223;&quot; is a pinnicle of linguistic ignorance and bureaucratic idiocy.</p></div>
<p><strong>Andrew West</strong> on 17 Apr 2008 7:23 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Read the proposal from DIN (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n3227.pdf">http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n3227.pdf</a>) -- rightly or wrongly a capital form of the letter is sometimes used in the middle of words written in all capitals (even on the cover of the 1960 and and 1964 Leipzig editions of &quot;Der Gro&#223;e Duden&quot;). Unicode is descriptive not prescriptive, and if a character exists then it is a candidate for encoding -- it is not up to Unicode to refuse to encode a character just because its usage is questionable.</p>
<p>As to capital eth (&#208;), it is used initially in Old English, and even in modern Icelandic it is required when a word with small eth (&#240;) medially is uppercased.</p></div>
<p><strong>John Cowan</strong> on 17 Apr 2008 9:28 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>It looks correct now (that is, I get a boxed-1E9E last-resort glyph). &nbsp;Since I switched to Linux, it's amazing how many of those I see now in the C0 range when surfing: people just seem to like throwing random U+000B's into their so-professional Web content.</p></div>
<p><strong>ReallyEvilCanine</strong> on 18 Apr 2008 8:51 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Andrew,</p>
<p>Perhaps I didn't make clear the source of my annoyance. DIN decided to invent a glyph for a character which is NEVER used as a capital because it has no initial form. It is only used in all caps to indicate the usage of the &quot;&#223;&quot; in normal upper &amp; lower case when there's a possibility of confusion; otherwise two esses are used.</p>
<p>It's as absurd as ISO decrfeeing a capital long-ess form.</p></div>

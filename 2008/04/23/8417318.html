<P>The question that was asked over in the microsoft.public.dotnet.international newsgroup by Samuel was:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times"><EM>I upload a text file with the following French character 'ç' and the server receives the following: 'Ã§' instead<BR><BR>Any explanation?<BR><BR>Thank you,<BR>Samuel </EM></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Regular readers might get&nbsp;an astounding sense of deja vu at that, due to remembering past blog posts like <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/08/11/4342275.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/08/11/4342275.html"><STRONG>Should old aquaintance *not* be forgot, code pages may screw up their names anyhow</STRONG></A> or <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/12/23/1354366.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/12/23/1354366.html"><STRONG>Do not adjust your browser, a.k.a. sometimes two wrongs DO make a right, a.k.a. dumb quotes</STRONG></A>&nbsp;or <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/03/21/399589.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/03/21/399589.html"><STRONG>Linguistic and Unicode considerations (or Language-specific Processing #4)</STRONG></A>&nbsp;or <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/06/04/616892.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/06/04/616892.html"><STRONG>What's the encoding, again?</STRONG></A>&nbsp;or <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/05/27/608351.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/05/27/608351.html"><STRONG>Consistent garbage text can be incorrect encoding identification (or detection)</STRONG></A>,</P>
<P>It is UTF-8. :-)</P>
<P>If one looks at <A class="" href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/reference/sbcs/1252.mspx" mce_href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/reference/sbcs/1252.mspx">Windows code page 1252</A> one will see the following mappings:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Ã -- 0xc3 -- <A class="" href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/00c3" mce_href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/00c3">U+00c3</A>, aka LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH TILDE</LI>
<LI>§ -- 0xa7 -- <A class="" href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/00a7" mce_href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/00a7">U+00a7</A>, aka SECTION SIGN</LI></UL>
<P>so it makes sense how someone could mix up those two bytes and think they are UTF-8. </P>
<P>In fact you can do it in Notepad! If your default system code page is 1252, take those two characters and save them to a text file, save it, close it, and open it.</P>
<P>You will see your</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=6>Ã§</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>become</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=6>ç</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>the same way.</P>
<P>In the end, Samuel's bug report has a few possible causes:</P>
<UL>
<LI>It could be a bug in the tool he uploads with marking the text as being in code page 1252 despite the fact that it is UTF-8;</LI>
<LI>it could be a bug in the place he is uploading to assuming it if code page 1252 despite the fact that it is UTF-8;</LI>
<LI>it could be a bug&nbsp; in a browser or other application looking at the uploaded content and misreaading it as code page 1252 despite the fact that it is UTF-8;</LI>
<LI>Various other permutations of the above with or without associated tagging.</LI></UL>
<P>so it may or may not be a bug still -- but with who or where the bug lies? To answer, more information is definitely required....</P>

You could enter in the garbled text on one side, and on the other side it would spit out a selection of code pages/encodings that possibly match, along with what the text would look like in that encoding. I wonder if such a thing exists?</p></div>
<p><strong>mpz</strong> on 27 Apr 2008 5:55 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>I think such a thing exists. A popular filesharing software that goes by the name of *zureus pops up a dialog with the filenames decoded in a few different encodings, asking you to pick the correct one (if the torrent metadata isn't new enough that it is UTF-8 always). It might be a feature of Java.</p></div>

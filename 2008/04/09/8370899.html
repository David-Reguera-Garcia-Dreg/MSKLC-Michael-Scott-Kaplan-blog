<P>Anyway, last night Andrea called.</P>
<P>After&nbsp;our usual pleasantries/ribbing/etc, the conversation turned out to be mainly about the blog (<STRONG>this</STRONG> blog)&nbsp;and went something like this, with the general theme being the phrase <STRONG>I'm aware of that</STRONG><FONT size=1><SUP>1</SUP></FONT>:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times"><STRONG>Andrea</STRONG>: Not everyone gets the "Fight the Future?" reference in your recent blogs.<BR><STRONG>Michael</STRONG>: <FONT color=#ff0000>I'm&nbsp;aware of that</FONT>.<BR><STRONG>Andrea</STRONG>:&nbsp;Maybe you could provide an explanation&nbsp;&nbsp;for the non "X-Files Geeks" in your audience.<BR><STRONG>Michael</STRONG>: Oh, okay, You see...<BR><STRONG>Andrea</STRONG>: You're the one always telling me about the difference between "I don't understand" and "I don't think this is understandable" aren't you?<BR><STRONG>Michael</STRONG>: Yes, that is the constant battle that documentation writers face, since developers are usually colorblind and sometimes condescending in that range.<BR><STRONG>Andrea</STRONG>: <FONT color=#ff0000>I'm&nbsp;aware of that</FONT>. I used to watch X-Files so I understood the reference. I meant explain for everyone else, you dope!<BR><STRONG>Michael</STRONG>: Uh oh, was I being condescending?<BR><STRONG>Andrea</STRONG>: No, but you were about to, love.<BR><STRONG>Michael</STRONG>: I guess <FONT color=#ff0000>I'm&nbsp;aware of that</FONT>. Fair enough, I'll put in my explanation soon.<BR><STRONG>Andrea</STRONG>: Good. Very good.<BR><STRONG>Michael</STRONG>: Perhaps this could have gone into the Suggestion Box?<BR><STRONG>Andrea</STRONG>: <FONT color=#ff0000>I'm&nbsp;aware of that</FONT>. <BR><STRONG>Michael</STRONG>: Good!<BR><STRONG>Andrea</STRONG>: To tell you the truth though,&nbsp;I find "Michael Live" to be more interesting. I'm sure other readers might try the same if they had your mobile.<BR><STRONG>Michael</STRONG>: <FONT color=#ff0000>I'm&nbsp;aware of that</FONT>. Carry on, MacDuff.<BR>{Michal sighs}<BR><STRONG>Michael</STRONG>: Anything else on your mind?<BR><STRONG>Andrea</STRONG>:&nbsp;Two things. But I don't know if you are up to them.<BR><STRONG>Michael</STRONG>: Try me.<BR><STRONG>Andrea</STRONG>: Been there, done that.<BR><STRONG>Michael</STRONG>: Ouch! Er, <FONT color=#ff0000>I'm&nbsp;aware of that</FONT>.<BR><STRONG>Andrea</STRONG>: Sorry, I couldn't resist!<BR><STRONG>Michael</STRONG>: <FONT color=#ff0000>I'm&nbsp;aware of that</FONT>, too. So anyway, you can just tell me what you're thinking. I'll either do it or I won't, right?<BR><STRONG>Andrea</STRONG>: Yes, <FONT color=#ff0000>I'm&nbsp;aware of that</FONT>.<BR>{Andrea sighs}<BR><STRONG>Andrea</STRONG>: Okay, the first one is that I think you need&nbsp;a good&nbsp;friend&nbsp;to give you suggestions for your non-technical posts sometimes. They are missing something, without... without... er...<BR><STRONG>Michael</STRONG>: Liz.<BR><STRONG>Andrea</STRONG>: Yes, sorry.<BR><STRONG>Michael</STRONG>: Well she is elephant in the room. <BR><STRONG>Andrea</STRONG>: Elephant?<BR><STRONG>Michael</STRONG>: Well, perhaps an uncannily slender elephant.<BR><STRONG>Andrea</STRONG>: In the room?<BR><STRONG>Michael</STRONG>:&nbsp;M<FONT face="times new roman,times"></FONT>aybe on the phone. <BR><STRONG>Andrea</STRONG>: <FONT color=#ff0000>I'm&nbsp;aware of that</FONT>.<BR><STRONG>Michael</STRONG>: No worries, go on....<BR><STRONG>Andrea</STRONG>: I was just thinking you could use a hand with your inspirations. I know I'm not <EM>her</EM>, but I think I can help a little.<BR><STRONG>Michael</STRONG>: I don't know, it isn't like something I ever scheduled.<BR><STRONG>Andrea</STRONG>: I didn't schedule this call, hon.<BR><STRONG>Michael</STRONG>: <FONT color=#ff0000>I'm&nbsp;aware of that</FONT>. And a fair point. You had something in mind, as a "for-instance"?<BR><STRONG>Andrea</STRONG>: Well I was thinking about songs and song themes. would you say that the Steve Taylor song you like and the Samantha Ronson song you like are opposite sides of the same relationship? Well, not relationship, but the same people, and the way that most relationships happen with the same like people?<BR><STRONG>Michael</STRONG>: Hmmm..... interesting. Not exactly that, though -- they are both about one person, each -- though from two different points of view. They could both be about the same person, though. I'll think about it, that could be interesting....<BR><STRONG>Andrea</STRONG>: Since it was my idea, I guess <FONT color=#ff0000>I'm&nbsp;aware of that</FONT>.<BR><STRONG>Michael</STRONG>: Though I think your take on it&nbsp;was wrong.<BR><STRONG>Andrea</STRONG>: <FONT color=#ff0000>I'm&nbsp;aware of that</FONT>.<BR><STRONG>Michael</STRONG>: So what was the other thing?<BR><STRONG>Andrea</STRONG>: The other thing?<BR><STRONG>Michael</STRONG>: You said&nbsp; two things. And then you only told me one.<BR><STRONG>Andrea</STRONG>:&nbsp;You certainly do&nbsp;pop the stack quite effectively, Mr. Kaplan.<BR><STRONG>Michael</STRONG>: <FONT color=#ff0000>I'm&nbsp;aware of that</FONT>. And Mr. Kaplan is my father, not I.<BR><STRONG>Andrea</STRONG>: Mr. Michael, <FONT color=#ff0000>I'm&nbsp;aware of that</FONT>. The other one is&nbsp;about the technical blogs.<BR><STRONG>Michael</STRONG>: Really? I didn't know you even read the technical blogs!<BR><STRONG>Andrea</STRONG>: I do, love.<BR><STRONG>Michael</STRONG>: <FONT color=#ff0000>I'm&nbsp;aware of that</FONT>. Well, I am now at least.<BR><STRONG>Andrea</STRONG>: I don't think people understand your relationship with your&nbsp;old team. Especially since you are still writing about a lot of the same things you were before. Do they read it? Do they agree with you or disagree? Do they still talk&nbsp;to you? <BR>{deep breath from Andrea}<BR><STRONG>Andrea</STRONG>: And I don't just mean other people for this one. I don't get this one either. What's your connection to them, now?<BR><STRONG>Michael</STRONG>: Oh wow, that one is a bit harder.<BR><STRONG>Andrea</STRONG>: <FONT color=#ff0000>I'm&nbsp;aware of that</FONT>. But I sincerely doubt that I am the only one who is curious.<BR><STRONG>Michael</STRONG>: Okay, I'll think about that one, too. Maybe that'd worth a post or two, at least for the "me" half of it. I wouldn't try to speak for the other half....<BR><STRONG>Andrea</STRONG>: It might help the confused among us. There is one more thing....<BR><STRONG>Michael</STRONG>: Uh oh.<BR><STRONG>Andrea</STRONG>: You need to take her advice and start keeping yourself open to the possibilities.<BR><STRONG>Michael</STRONG>: How do you know I haven't been?<BR><STRONG>Andrea</STRONG>: Have you?<BR><STRONG>Michael</STRONG>: I couldn't say, really.<BR><STRONG>Andrea</STRONG>: Why not?<BR><STRONG>Michael</STRONG>: If I were it would be a secret. And "the best little secrets are kept."<BR><STRONG>Andrea</STRONG>: <FONT color=#ff0000>I'm&nbsp;aware of that</FONT>. But those lyrics are for your special fan club made up of 23 year old girls.<BR><STRONG>Michael</STRONG>: Hardly a club! And at 23 they are women and often ladies. Girls seems kind of demeaning.<BR><STRONG>Andrea</STRONG>: <FONT color=#ff0000>I'm&nbsp;aware of that</FONT>. But it is still easy to get a rise out of you.<BR><STRONG>Michael</STRONG>: You read the blogs, just like they do. And when I act too obfuscationary, like in </FONT><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/12/25/6857659.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/12/25/6857659.html"><STRONG><FONT face="times new roman,times">that alphabet soup blog</FONT></STRONG></A><FONT face="times new roman,times">, the people who didn't get it thought I must have been on drugs when I wrote it.<BR><STRONG>Andrea</STRONG>: Were you?<BR><STRONG>Michael</STRONG>: No!<BR><STRONG>Andrea</STRONG>: So tell 'em to fuck off. <BR><STRONG>Michael</STRONG>: Hardly open and respectful, that.<BR><STRONG>Andrea</STRONG>: <FONT color=#ff0000>I'm&nbsp;aware of that</FONT>. But that blog was awesome. <BR><STRONG>Michael</STRONG>: I didn't know you thought so, you never mentioned it.<BR><STRONG>Andrea</STRONG>:&nbsp;Jacob learned a lot. With all the languages he knows? He&nbsp;thought it was great.<BR><STRONG>Michael</STRONG>: Jacob, he's your boyfriend, right? Nice to know I made your beau that happiest person in Nederland....<BR><STRONG>Andrea</STRONG>: Second happiest, actually!<BR>{pause while Michael laughs hysterically at a joke that you may not understand fully, but if you don't them keep in mind that I am not drunk or on drugs!}<BR><STRONG>Michael</STRONG>: I'm still not going to drop hints about&nbsp;actual Sheilas or times I play the Beau. It is quite&nbsp;obnoxious, you know?<BR><STRONG>Andrea</STRONG>: Haven't you been doing that already?<BR><STRONG>Michael</STRONG>: Not usually, no. I tend to go on when it isn't happening, not when it is.<BR><STRONG>Andrea</STRONG>: So how can I tell the difference between a friendship upgrades into a relationship and when you just kind of grow apart, if you stop talking in both cases?<BR><STRONG>Michael</STRONG>: Well first of all, you can't -- by design. <BR><STRONG>Andrea</STRONG>: <FONT color=#ff0000>I'm&nbsp;aware of that</FONT>.<BR><STRONG>Michael</STRONG>: And second of all, with perhaps one or two not-terribly-recent exceptions, that particular conversion has always been a downgrade for me, unless I was able to revert the change quickly enough to keep from "breaking the build" of the friendship.<BR><STRONG>Andrea</STRONG>:&nbsp;I wonder whether you&nbsp;realize that if you didn't talk about relationships like they were software development projects that you might be&nbsp;more successful at them.<BR><STRONG>Michael</STRONG>: <FONT color=#ff0000>I'm&nbsp;aware of that</FONT>.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>We eventually hung up the phone, some time before Dallas came on (Sue Ellen launches a film to ruin J.R., and J.R. foils a deal.).</P>
<P>We agreed to have <STRONG>unscheduled</STRONG> conversations from time to time, and I agreed to think about the potential blog topics, above.</P>
<P>I needed that.</P>
<P>Friends that know when they need to jump in and talk to you about something when no one else seems to? Priceless! :-)</P>

On all later occasions, no drinking happened, but we would laugh and acknowledge that it was the appropriate time to take a drink....<BR>2 - In the game, every time someone said something you knew, you had to say <STRONG>I'm aware of that</STRONG> and take a&nbsp;swallow of your drink. You could try and skip it but if someone called you on it then you would have to finish your drink and repour.<BR>3 - In more recent years, another friend of mine (Stephanie) unknowingly inspired me to create a similar game with a diferent phrase, one that was her favorite -- <STRONG>There is <EM>no</EM> question</STRONG>. </FONT></P>

<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 9 Apr 2008 5:42 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>In this case it was from memory; I have a great short term memory for conversations and when it is a really important conversation sometimes even longer....</p>
<p>I never record them though, that would be creepy! It is bad enough that I am slow to shut IM windows since that will give me several &quot;days&quot; of memory and people think I save logs until they look and see that I just never shut down the IM windows until Patch Tuesday. :-)</p>

<p><strong>MSK Fan Club</strong> on 18 Apr 2008 1:33 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Glad you're still being held accountable. Do you IP track your comments?</p></div>
<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 18 Apr 2008 2:21 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><P>That someone is out there self-identifying as a member of my "fan club" is rather frightening!</P>
<P>But I generally do not IP track comments -- lots of the anonymous resolve to the MS firewall, which I suppose means something. :-)</P>
<P>And since Andrea can't force me to do her bidding (a job she used to have), I am not sure if this is true accountability....</P></div>

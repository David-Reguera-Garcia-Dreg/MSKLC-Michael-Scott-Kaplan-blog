<P>I tend to prefer doing all of my Instant Messaging in Windows Live Messenger rather than Office Communicator. </P>
<P>Nothing personal, it is just more something that fits me (in truth Windows Messenger was an even better fit, but once you install either of these other two&nbsp;you can't ever launch Windows Messenger&nbsp;again, even if you uninstall them -- it is treated like a post 2009 analog TV set in the US!).</P>
<P>Why? Well, it is like a dozen little things like that which just drive me to the other product. I just don't want to know so much about the people who hang up or whatever else it pays attention to. And so on....</P>
<P>Now I still have to have Office Communicator on my machine, since that seems to be the only way I can forward calls from my office phone<FONT size=1><SUP>1</SUP></FONT>, which means I launch it, set it (or unset it) and then exit.</P>
<P>One&nbsp;amusing thing about Communicator is the words it puts into the status column, such as</P>
<UL>
<LI>In a meeting</LI>
<LI>Do not disturb</LI>
<LI>Busy</LI>
<LI>Inactive</LI>
<LI>Out of office</LI>
<LI>Away</LI>
<LI>Offline</LI>
<LI>Presence Unknown</LI></UL>
<P>and then there is my favorite, the one that comes up if a person is online and not occupied in any of these or various other ways:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT color=#00ff00 size=6>Available</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>I find the "Available" thing to be awfully presumptuous -- available for what, exactly?</P>
<P>Especially at Microsoft, and then especially squared with some of the people on my contact list, there is if nothing else a certain emotional unavailability that is inherent to many of the listed. It just seemed very weird (and perhaps a tad amusing!) to see some of them listed as being "Available"....</P>
<P>To be safe I think I will stick to Windows Live Messenger, though. The more neutral <STRONG>Online</STRONG> is really more up my alley for when I happen to be online, without admitting any particular type of availability. :-)</P>
<P mce_keep="true">&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT size=1>1 -&nbsp;This is really important when I want to see what the voice recognition software on the Microsoft autodialer is misunderstanding as "Michael Kaplan" during a given week. There have been some amusing ones lately. :-)</FONT></P>

<P>The season finale of House was on last night. A pretty bad situation came up (I am being oblique in my description to avoid spoilers!) and the drug Amantadine (aka Symmetrel) came up.</P>
<P>I received two phone calls within an&nbsp;hour after the show was done from friends of mine who knew I was once taking Amantadine to help with some MS symptoms (not for flu).</P>
<P>I am not on Amantadine any more, and I do not have any of the problems for which taking it would cause it to be contraindicated, anyway.</P>
<P>But it is nice I&nbsp;suppose to have so many people concerned about me? :-)</P>

<p>That's like writing &quot;I was working on an important project and Windows blue-screened&quot;. EVERY episode of House is the same thing:</p>
<p>* Patient comes in, everyone's stumped</p>
<p>* House makes some wild diagnosis </p>
<p>* No one believes him, all run around like fools trying to prove him wrong</p>
<p>* House needs pain meds, badly</p>
<p>* House rips apart other docs' guesses with super-duper medical terminology that most docs have forgotten by the time they finish their residency because no one ever has that disease or ailment or that part of the body anymore</p>
<p>* Some secondary character does something highly controversial in a sub-plot</p>
<p>*House really, &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; wants meds and this time he's not kidding.</p>
<p>* House finally proves he's right in a most dramatic fashion; the patient survives</p>
<p>* People still treat House like dirt but he gets a handful of Vicodin before the credit roll is over.</p>
<p>That's it. I saw a couple episodes and they were OK (and Laurie's really good), but the next show I watched, all I could think was that it was a rerun. There's less differentiation between episodes of &lt;i&gt;House&lt;/i&gt; than there was with &lt;i&gt;The A-Team&lt;/i&gt;.</p>
<p>Back to a more reasonable topic: why doesn't VOLT do what I want it to do? When I open a font it should show me the info I want to see like ligatures and substitutions and most of all, the cmap. But it doesn't. It won't even show the glyphs half the time I'd throw my toys out of the crib on the forum but I figure I have a better chance of not getting kicked out of your blog having previously proven my entertainment value.</p></div>

While ranting on about some television series, our evil-doing nemesis completely overlooked the display of concern from intarwebs friends shown by posting a comment which clearly required some modicum of effort, and we may yet have managed to sneak in a question which could be answered at some bat-time on this bat-URL. I believe the Commissioner will be pleased. Now go find Albert and ask him where the Bat-vodka is.</P></div>

<P>Regular reader Jan Kučera asked over in the Suggestion Box:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><EM><FONT face="times new roman,times">Hi,<BR><BR>Okay, this might be a little bit non-technical question, but... every day, somebody wants a _strong_ password from me. The best one would be of course kilometer long, with some crazy stuff like _-*!#$ in it.<BR><BR>Well, I have nothing against special 'symbols' in the password, but why on earth only ASCII characters are supported? I don't know how about eg. banks in USA, but for my short life I haven't found any web site allowing me to enter (um... support) unicode password.<BR><BR>Am I missing something fundamental here? :)<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jan</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>My experience has been similar to Jan's though slightly different:</P>
<OL>
<LI>You can include pretty much any kind of character you want, but</LI>
<LI>Characters outside of ASCII are not given&nbsp;appropriate consideration in term of overall complexity.</LI></OL>
<P>Thus when you look at MSDN topics like <A class="" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms722458.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms722458.aspx">Strong Password Enforcement and Passfilt.dll</A>, they say things like:</P>

<P>The following complexity requirements are enforced by strong password enforcement:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Passwords may not contain your user name or any part of your full name. 
<LI>Passwords must be at least six characters long.

<P mce_keep="true">Having a nod to Unicode seems nice, and it is a welcome addition to the world of password complexity.</P>

<P>- remove any user info from it: username, first/last name, phone, etc.</P>
<P>- collapse any duplications: "abcabc" -&gt; "abc", "foofoo" -&gt; "fo"</P>
<P>- take what's left, and complexity = sum of distances between characters.</P>
<P>It aims to not only ensure a computer can't easily brute force it, but also to ensure it won't be trivial for a human to guess or remember from a quick glance.</P>
<P>It has worked well for me. &nbsp;Works with and even rewards using Unicode.</P></div>

<p>That is a reason to not use them; it is hardly an argument against the amount of complexity they add, though...</p>

<p><a id="8555586" href="#8555586">#</a> <strong>Dean Harding</strong> on 27 May 2008 6:57 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Bruce gives *a* reason not to use Unicode passwords, but it obviously doesn't apply to everybody -- it certainly would only apply in the U.S. and maybe a few other English-speaking countries, but even in Australia, most internet cafes support lots of different languages (we do tourists here...). And what about people who don't use public computers at all (personally, the idea of typing my bank password in a public computer gives me the willies)</p>
<p>I gotta agree with you on this one, Michael. When you look at the number of possible characters in each of those five &quot;categories&quot; you get 27, 27, 10, 50 (tops) and 65,000+. Something is funny there...</p></div>
<p><a id="8555588" href="#8555588">#</a> <strong>Dean Harding</strong> on 27 May 2008 7:01 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>In fact, I'd probably go so far as to say that typing *any* password requiring &quot;complexity rules&quot; should not by typed into a public computer at all...</p>
<p>I know, sometimes you might not have a choice, but if it were me, I'd change my password as quickly as I can after doing it. If you're going overseas on holidays for example, you could change your password to a simple ASCII-based one before you leave, and then change it back to a strong one when I got back.</p></div>

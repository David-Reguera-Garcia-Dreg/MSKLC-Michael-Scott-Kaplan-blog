<h1>The risk of "Hebrew Smatter"</h1>

<P>The mail I got the other day via the Contact link was a tad scary for me:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times">Hi Michael,<BR><BR>I come from Switzerland. I'm 21 years old and I'm studying tourism.<BR><BR>I was looking for some helps on the Internet as I have a passion for Hebrew and all the jewish culture.<BR><BR>I have in mind to get a tattoo between my shoulder plates and I just wanted to ask you if you would help me to translate the message I want in Hebrew script ?<BR><BR>Just let me know ...<BR><BR>Thanks for your attention.<BR>Bye.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Now the scary part is not the interest -- over the years I've known and in some case even dated people who weren't Jewish but who had a certain fascination with the religion, and my quite odd "took years of conversational Hebrew, more years of Biblical Hebrew, studied Torah/Talmud extensively,&nbsp;raised Conservative, became Orthodox, now is mostly a knowledgeable agnostic who stutters when reading Hebrew except for the prayers he knows" fueled lots of interest -- especially the philosophical questions and doubts that led to the transitions.</P>
<P>What I'm saying is that anyone can be a "Hebro-phile" and it does not scare me.</P>
<P>But doesn't the&nbsp;consideration of&nbsp;a tattoo seem like just begging for&nbsp;something like the&nbsp;Hebrew equivalent of <A class="" title="Hanzi Smatter" href="http://www.hanzismatter.com/" mce_href="http://www.hanzismatter.com/">Hanzi Smatter</A> -- that site that is <STRONG>dedicated to the misuse of chinese characters in western culture</STRONG>.</P>
<P>I would just be so afraid to end up giving poor advice here -- advice that ends up good enough to look like a great Hebrew tattoo but which takes on a subtle meaning that is either offensive or insulting (or both).</P>
<P>So, I am going to have to beg off of this one, and avoid becoming someone to cause Hebrew Smatter in Switzerland....</P>

Also, piercings, scarification, burning and any other permanent markings or disfigurements caused intentionally and not for medical reasons. </p></div>

<p><strong>Sandheat78</strong> on 31 Oct 2009 11:37 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>This is a comment to the reply of Really Evil Canine. &nbsp;It is a common misconception that the Leviticus verse in the bible is saying that as a believer, you should not get a tattoo. &nbsp;Actually, what that verse is says is &quot;Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you: I am the LORD.&quot; &nbsp;It was common practice for people to cut themselves for idol worship, or for honoring the dead. &nbsp;Because we are only to worship God, these practices are dishonorable to Him. &nbsp;Jesus, if you do some research, actually had a tattoo Himself, on his upper leg. &nbsp;The Bible also, will restate verses several times...you will find the Bible eludes to this verse in Isa 15:2; Jer 16:6; 41:5; Isa 44:5; Re 13:17; 14:1. &nbsp;</p></div>

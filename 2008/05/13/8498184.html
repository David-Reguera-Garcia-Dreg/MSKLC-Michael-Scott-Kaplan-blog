<P>I have talked about WinZip and Zip in the past, in particular their odd relationship with Unicode, in blogs like:</P>

<P>Now if you spend some time in the comments in that <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/05/10/416181.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/05/10/416181.html"><STRONG>Zipping up Unicode file names</STRONG></A>&nbsp;blog, several people talked about how the ZIP formt itself has extensions to handle Unicode. Of course without implementers that is quite the theoretical point. If you know what I mean.</P>
<P>But do you know what?</P>
<P>Well, the gloves are off now, baby!</P>

<p><strong>Yuhong Bao</strong> on 12 Mar 2009 8:45 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>&quot;Why did they remove support for ARJ and ARC?&quot;</p>
<p>Because they depended on DOS programs which cannot run on 64-bit Windows, for example.</p></div>

<p>The offensive file name looks fine when I open the archive and look at it. &nbsp;But when I open the archive programatically (SharpZLib) the IsUnicodeText flag is set to false and my extractor garbles the name...</p></div>

<p><strong>David Pierson</strong> on 4 Mar 2010 8:10 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Better Unicode support for filenames in SharpZipLib is my current priority. This is a feature that I am very keen to see in the library in the next release. </p>
<p>SharpZipLib (a Zip, GZip, Tar and BZip2 library written entirely in C# for the .NET platform) has many users from around the globe for whom English is not their native language. All the zip format implementors have only gotten away with lack of Unicode for this long thanks to the fact that most of us never stray from their local code page. </p>
<p>Michael, your blog posts such as the &quot;Zipping up Unicode file names&quot; entry have been a particularly useful resource for us in providing a reliable live commentary on the state of play in this regard. </p>

One would have thought this would have been addressed (i.e., fixed)! &nbsp;(At least my version of W7 Home Professional upgraded to Ultimate still fails like Win2K: &nbsp;viz., &quot; 'EA\大阪市交通局は２３日.doc' cannot be compressed because it includes characters that cannot be used in a compressed folder, such as 大阪市交通局は２３日.

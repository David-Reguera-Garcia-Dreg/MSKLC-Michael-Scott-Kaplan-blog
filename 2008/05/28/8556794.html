<P><EM>(A continuation after </EM><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/05/21/8525127.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/05/21/8525127.html"><STRONG><EM>Summer vacation, the 1st</EM></STRONG></A><EM>, and there may well be a part 3 though perhaps in a later season)</EM></P>
<P>The wedding was amazing, as was the whole weekend, really. </P>
<P>I'll be posting a bunch of pictures on facebook soon and I might even change my profile picture if one with the tux looks suitable. :-)</P>
<P>As per the usual, the Glazer family rocks, and as it turns out the Ogans rock too, and I have never been so proud as when I noticed that Jenny did not update her facebook&nbsp;status after the last "Jennifer is getting married!!! (this really warrants the triple exclamation)." one. Plenty of time for that stuff after they get back, and the whole point of work/life balance is to occasionally embrace LIFE....</P>
<P>Truly a wonderful visit to Cleveland, despite the lack of dancing&nbsp;on my part.</P>
<P>Though as vacations go it did fail in a couple of respects:</P>
<UL>
<LI>it wasn't long enough</LI>
<LI>no actual vacation time was taken</LI></UL>
<P>Obviously one of these&nbsp;caused the other (you can take your pick which one is the cause) but the reason I always come so close to losing vacation time at the end of the year is that I never manage to take the days. So it seems worth fixing that....</P>
<P>My next vacation will be in Sunny Orlando, next week -- about the same time as the developer half of Tech·Ed 2008 North America. Just before sunny Seattle becomes a more regular phenomenon, which kind of defeats the purpose, I know.</P>
<P>Just going as me (who happens to work for Microsoft) not as me representing Microsoft and my group. There is a difference, though the distinction will be lost in people who don't understand why someone&nbsp;in Windows wouldn't have access to Office code. Which is more than a few people out there....</P>
<P>I'm not speaking at the conference and probably won't be at Tech·Ed the whole time, but I will be at some of the parties and at a few of the events. I'll blather about this and that and maybe even do a Tech Talk, bog willing. I'll say hi to a bunch of people I haven't seen&nbsp;for a bit, and if&nbsp;I can swing it&nbsp;I will be at a minimum of one presentation in particular that I was invited to be at, to support a friend nervous about last-day placement.</P>
<P>If you are going to be at Tech·Ed and want to say hello then drop me a note via the Contact link (or even in a comment here if you want)&nbsp;and let me know, I'm sure we can probably find a way to meet and greet or get&nbsp;a drink or a meal or whatever. Especially those of you who live in the same city as me but I never see unless I am on the opposite side of the country, for whatever reason that happens.</P>
<P>If I <STRONG>do</STRONG> or <STRONG>say</STRONG> or <STRONG>hear</STRONG> anything interesting while I am there, I'll be sure to blog about it here in the Blog.</P>
<P>I'll let you know how it goes. :-)</P>

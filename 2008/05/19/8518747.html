<P>Pamela asked via th Contact link:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><EM><FONT face="times new roman,times">How do I clean out my autofil.&nbsp; I can clear out Outlook's Contacts, but not the autofill, and I have loads of mistyped, altered addresses, which has me sending to all and having the wrong ones returned as "undeliverable".&nbsp; Only way to do it!</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Not really my kind of question usually, but I had to puzzle this one out recently with the help of a friend, so it's Pamela's lucky day<FONT size=1><SUP>1,2</SUP></FONT>....</P>
<P>The easy way to do this:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Start&nbsp;Outlook</LI>
<LI>Tools|Options from the menu</LI>
<LI>Push the Email Options button</LI>
<LI>Push the Advanced Email Options button</LI>
<LI>Uncheck the "Suggest Names while completing To, Cc and Bcc fields" checkbox</LI>
<LI>Close Outlook</LI>
<LI>Repeat steps 1-4 and check the setting</LI></OL>
<P>And then of course direct from the Microsoft Knowledge Base is the hard way (287623: <A class="" href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/287623/" mce_href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/287623/">How to reset the nickname and the automatic completion caches in Outlook</A>).</P>

With the help of the KB-article I found some useful keywords for google, when I found this:</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://itnsomnia.wordpress.com/2008/04/02/remove-an-entry-from-the-outlook-nickname-cache/">http://itnsomnia.wordpress.com/2008/04/02/remove-an-entry-from-the-outlook-nickname-cache/</a></p>
<p>Basically, all you need to do is when the invalid name/address is display, press Delete and you will erase it.</p>
<p>Works for me at least. :)</p></div>

<p>I mean, really! &nbsp;This is a cache, a file used to store disposable information. &nbsp;But the procedure doesn't tell you to delete the cache, like a sensible person would expect. &nbsp;Oh no. &nbsp;You rename it. &nbsp;Why????</p>

<p>Yes, this way has always been there for removing one entry that you fully type out. But given the situation she describes and the number of bad entries she implies, I doubt this would do it (plus she was looking to &quot;clear&quot; the list, which implies the whole list).</p>

<p>I assume the rename is mentioned because this is less permanent, and easy to reverse if one changes one's mind? :-)</p>

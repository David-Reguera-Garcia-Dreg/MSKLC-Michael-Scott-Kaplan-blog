<P>Y-u may recall when I first wrote the <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/04/11/8378179.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/04/11/8378179.html"><STRONG>Backf-rmati-n -f deity</STRONG></A> bl-g, back in April.</P>
<P>Y-u kn-w, when I talked ab-ut the interesting way that replacing <STRONG>God</STRONG> with <STRONG>G-d</STRONG>, intended in part to h-ld deity seperate , actually saw the argument s-mewhat hurt by using <STRONG>g-ds</STRONG> in place of <STRONG>gods</STRONG>.</P>
<P>Well, there&nbsp;exists n-t an&nbsp;argument that regular reader reader John Cowan can't c-mplicate! :-)</P>
<P>In resp-nse to my <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/05/28/8556794.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/05/28/8556794.html"><STRONG>Summer vacation, the 2nd</STRONG></A> bl-g, in particular the f-ll-wing bit:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times"><EM>"bog"?&nbsp; I think you mean "B-g".</EM></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Hmmmm.</P>
<P>N-w we may n-t really kn-w the true religi-n in which Manuel Garcia O'Kelly Davis Long believes, but we can be certain (in carefully reading <STRONG>The Moon is a Harsh Mistress</STRONG> and <STRONG>Time Enough For Love</STRONG> and <STRONG>To Sail Beyond the Sunset</STRONG>) that it is n-t Judaism. Given that, taking the deity he invokes, <STRONG>Bog</STRONG> and making it <STRONG>B-g</STRONG> seems like yet another interesting backf-rmati-n of deity.</P>
<P>F-r my own usage, I d-n't tend to think of the true deity&nbsp;atop all creati- n to be named <STRONG>Bog</STRONG>, and given that in my c-ll-quial use of his name I felt unc-mf-rtable with the en-bling capitalization, thus I used <STRONG>bog</STRONG>. :-)</P>
<P>This particular bl-g y-u are n-w reading is being d-ne&nbsp;respectfully f-r th-se w-rshipping the deity kn-wn as <STRONG>The Big O</STRONG>, a sect where every member spends their wh-le entire life searching f-r <STRONG>The Big O</STRONG> and thus finds the letter 'O' in text to be distracting and pe-ple using it being&nbsp;s-mewhat minimizing the difficulty of their search -- thus they replace the letter in words with a hyphen....</P>
<P>I c-uld explain the sect further --&nbsp;its use of Shel Silverstein "Missing Piece" t-mes as prayerb--ks&nbsp;and h-w they n-te the general tendency pe-ple, even if n-n-believers,&nbsp;have -f inv-king deity in their own&nbsp;achievements in their search&nbsp;f-r <STRONG>The Big O</STRONG> -- but this&nbsp;bl-g is already disrespectful en-ugh as it is, thus I will end it n-w....</P>

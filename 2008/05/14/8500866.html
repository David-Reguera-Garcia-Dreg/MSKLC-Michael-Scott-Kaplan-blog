<P>I can't help feeling <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/05/08/8459104.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/05/08/8459104.html"><STRONG>that Outlook HoliDAZE thing</STRONG></A> again (and I just added that word to my spell-checking dictionary -- I think we've not seen the last of this!).</P>
<P>So this last Monday was <A class="" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whit_Monday" mce_href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whit_Monday">Whit Monday</A> for some people, as Outlook let me know:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/whit01.png"></P>
<P>Interesting. </P>
<P>Okay, that takes care of the Roman Catholics. How about the Eastern Orthodox?</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/whit03.png"></P>
<P>Now we don't have to totally panic here. As Wikipedia describes:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><EM><FONT face="times new roman,times">In the Eastern Orthodox Church Whit Monday is known as "Monday of the Holy Spirit" or "Day of the Holy Spirit" and is the first day of the afterfeast of Pentecost, being dedicated specifically to the honor of God the Holy Spirit.</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>So it looks like they have it for Greece, at least. So not all of the locations are lost here -- just most of them. :-(</P>
<P>Of course it gets a little worse when you look for <A class="" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whit_Friday" mce_href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whit_Friday">Whit Friday</A>:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/whit02.png"></P>
<P>Again I can't help feeling&nbsp; like calendars in Outlook are once again letting me down here....</P>

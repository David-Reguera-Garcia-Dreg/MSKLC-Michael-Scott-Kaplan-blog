<P>I found 25 to be the last birthday I actually look forward to.</P>
<P>I think that is to do with my cynical nature -- I mean at 16 you can get your license<FONT size=1><SUP>1</SUP></FONT>, at 18 you can vote or enlist<SUP><FONT size=1>2</FONT></SUP>, at 21 you can drink<SUP><FONT size=1>3</FONT></SUP>.</P>
<P>And at 25 I could finally afford my auto insurance rates.and could rent cars without&nbsp;a corporate card<SUP><FONT size=1>4</FONT></SUP>.</P>
<P>Every birthday after that, there was really nothing official<SUP><FONT size=1>5</FONT></SUP> to look forward to. :-)</P>
<P>Eventually I stopped caring about birthdays because it seems like it is an anniversary of an eviction<SUP><FONT size=1>6,7,8</FONT></SUP>.</P>
<P>But this blog is not meant to be about me, even though everything up until now has been.</P>
<P>It is about 25.</P>
<P>And the fact that Michael Suignard just celebrated his 25th year working for Microsoft!</P>
<P>Here he is with our General Manager, Julie Bennett:</P>

<P>Michel is by his own report one of the most long-employed people at Microsoft, still working for Microsoft. He is like the 10th oldest or thereabouts. Cool!</P>
<P>John McConnell did a hilarious little speech where he researched how things were 25 years ago, and it was noted that some of the people at the party were not actually even born yet when he started working for MS.</P>
<P>Michel has been a part of Unicode for about as long as there has been Unicode, and he is the editor of 10646 (I think that is how I first met him, in&nbsp;a story not nearly as interesting as John's recollection of a failed attempt of Michel to try to train John to properly pronounce Alain LaBonté's first name!).</P>
<P>And then there was the mysterious case:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/michel25_002.png" mce_src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/michel25_002.png"></P>
<P>This case is pretty heavy, but as you may notice has no handle.</P>
<P>It isn't a bomb, it is a container for that "years of service" award many employees know and love:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/michel25_003.png" mce_src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/michel25_003.png"></P>
<P>The inscription is hard to make out from the picture but says:</P>

<P mce_keep="true">And the full award is also quite impressive:</P>

<P mce_keep="true">It made me wonder if Heywood Floyd knew that Microsoft had stolen their monolith! :-)</P>
<P mce_keep="true">I think in order to get the 50-year award home (one Microsoft has been around fifty years)&nbsp;you have to rent a truck. Or maybe they just hit you on the head with a tack hammer and tell you to take a sabbatical....</P>
<P mce_keep="true">In any case, congratulations to Michel for a very impressive milestone!</P>

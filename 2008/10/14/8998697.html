<P>I don't think that a blog has the force of law or anything, but hopefully when I die those charged with deciding how to dispose of my body will respect wishes I write here.</P>
<P>This blog contains a few of my wishes.</P>
<P>Basically, I want to be buried, not cremated. Just in case the faith I grew up in correct about my heavenly body somehow being linked to my early one, let's not make my remains suitable for a blender or easily mistaken for a urn full of herbal tea.</P>
<P>I realize how ridiculous the claims might be, but again just in case I am wrong I' like to cover this one base as best as I can.</P>
<P>I'd like a small non-gaudy headstone with the following words on it:</P>

<P><B><FONT size=5>1970 - &lt;insert date of death here&gt;</FONT></B></P>
<P><B><FONT size=5>Generally thought to be bad attrition</FONT></B></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Nothing else needed or probably even wanted.</P>
<P>This what I strive for every day, in what I think is a much more constructive way to think of things then treating every day as if it is the last day of your life just in case it might be.</P>
<P>My fondest hope is that those left behind will consider my loss to be bad attrition...</P>
<P>Can one ever really do better than that? :-)<BR></P>

<p>Long time readers may remember back in April of 2005 when in <b><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/04/29/413553.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/04/29/413553.html">Getting enough exercise?</a></b> I talked about my adventures with a scooter that broke on the way back from Typhoon! in Redmond to my apartment, and the long walk I did pushing a scooter for a not-so-insignificant chunk of time.</p><p>I swore I'd never put myself in that situation again.</p><p>Famous last words, right?</p><p>Because yesterday I had to sign over the title of the Saab (ref: <b><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/10/13/8997133.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/10/13/8997133.html">Another death in the family</a></b>) plus clean out my personal items, and the place I had to go to was over on Redmond Way heading out towards Issaquah.</p><p>And I chose to tempt fate and scoot over there, with the big scooter so I could fit everything that was sitting in the car.</p><p>You probably know where I am going with this now.</p><p>Because I ran out of juice in the batteries about halfway through that bike path off of 520.</p><p>Sigh.</p><p>Now this time I did not have push the scooter. It still had enough power to push itself.</p><p>However, it did not have enough power to push itself plus 160 pounds of me.</p><p>So I just had to walk next to the scooter and hold the lever, resting occasionally by just sitting down in the scooter.</p><p>This is of course in marked contrast to the previous time, when actual engine problems caused it to be unable to run, even without me in the driver's seat.</p><p>I made it home alive, though quite exhausted. </p><p>Interestingly, I felt a bit like I imagine the Saab felt just before it died.</p><p>And swearing I'd never put myself in that situation again. </p><p>An oath that I fully intend to live by, until the next time....</p><p><br></p><p><font face="Tahoma"><font color="#ff00ff"><i>This post brought to you by</i><font size="6"> </font><font size="6">â™¿ </font></font><i><font color="#ff00ff">(</font><a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/267f" class="" mce_href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/267f">U+267f</a><font color="#ff00ff">, a.k.a.

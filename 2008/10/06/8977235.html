<p>So it was yesterday morning<font size="1"><sup>1</sup></font> when Rae Dawn Chong<font size="1"><sup>2,3</sup></font> put in her facebook status:</p>

<p>Of course there are some interesting language problems here that occurred to me, despite the fact that I knew what she meant, some of which are caused by the underlying definitions of the words involved.</p>
<p>Starting with the obvious, of course.... </p>
<p>Since in this country you must be <b>registered</b> in order to <b>vote</b>, one could just as easily make the statement that I did in the title -- there is a certain logical analogue there. :-)</p>
<p>So, just like back in <b><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/03/09/1842581.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/03/09/1842581.html">But is it mnemonical?</a></b>, hints of Mark Liberman's <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000012.html" class="" mce_href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000012.html">Those 
who are not authorized are not authorized</a> are there.<br>
</p>

<p>Now in order to be <b>registered</b>, there are specific requirements. From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registered_voter#United_States" mce_href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registered_voter#United_States">Wikipedia's article on the subject</a>:</p>
<blockquote>



<p><font face="times new roman,times">Under the United States Constitution, states 
may not restrict voting rights on the basis of race (Fifteenth 
Amendment) or sex (Nineteenth 
Amendment). The Twenty-sixth 
Amendment prohibits the federal government and the states from forbidding 
any citizen of age 18 or greater to vote simply because of their age.<br><br>While the federal government has jurisdiction over federal elections, most 
election laws are decided at the state level and the true authority to interpret 
and enforce those laws comes at the local level. Because of this, the 
administration of elections can vary widely across jurisdictions.<br><br>Registering to vote is the responsibility of individuals in the United 
States. Voters are not automatically registered to vote once they reach the age 
of 18. Every state except North Dakota requires that citizens who wish to 
vote be registered.<br><br>Traditionally, voters had to register at state offices to vote, but in the 
mid-1990s efforts were made by the federal government to make registering 
easier, in an attempt to increase turnout. The National Voter Registration 
Act of 1993 (the "Motor Voter" law) forced state governments to make the 
voter registration process easier by providing uniform registration services 
through drivers' license registration centers, disability centers, schools, 
libraries, and mail-in registration. Some states allow citizens to register to 
vote on the same day of the election, known as Election Day Registration. States 
with same-day registration are exempt from Motor Voter, namely: Idaho, 
Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.Voters may 
register at the local election office (which is usually at city or town hall) 
or, one may call the election department and request a voter registration form 
through the mail. Voter registration forms may be found at public libraries and 
registries of motor vehicles. These forms must be filled out and mailed to the 
local election department. Also, one may register at a voter 
registration drive. The only states with online voter registration are 
Arizona and Washington, though legislation has been introduced in other 
states.<br><br>Some states prohibit individuals convicted of a felony from voting, known as 
felony disenfranchisement. One may 
register wherever one has an address, regardless of its permanence- for example, 
a college student living away from home may register to vote in the college's 
city, even if that is not a permanent address. In most states, one must 
register, usually 30 days before a given election, in order to vote in it. Six 
states, Idaho, Maine, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Wisconsin and Wyoming, allow for 
Election Day Registration.<br><br>In some states, when registering to vote, one may declare an affiliation with 
a political party. 
This declaration of affiliation does not cost any money, and it is not the same 
as being a dues-paying member of a party; for example, a party cannot prevent 
anybody from declaring his or her affiliation with them, but it can refuse 
requests for full membership. Some states, including Michigan and Virginia do 
not have party affiliation with registration.<br><br>In general elections, a voter may choose to vote for all of a particular 
party's candidates (<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/wiki/Straight-ticket_voting" title="Straight-ticket voting"></a>straight-ticket voting) or to vote for 
candidates from different parties for different offices (Party X's candidate for 
President, Party Y's candidate for Senator, Party Z's candidate for Governor). 
In a general election, one's political party affiliation does not determine 
which party's candidates one may vote for. <br></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The obvious deeper issue here that this description makes clear is that the requirements vary -- there are even states<font size="1"><sup>4</sup></font> where no registration is required, as well as ones that have not hit a deadline in terms of lack of registration meaning it is too late to vote -- they can register on the very same day!</p><p>I happen to live in a state (WA) that I heard in 2006 had something like over 85% of the vote handled by mail, which is the same thing as absentee ballots, though many of them arrive in before election day. I was reading an article last week that claimed that by 2010 WA would be 100% mail-in for its ballots. The registration deadline still exist, though registration (if not already done, as it was for me) can be done online, which of course makes it even easier (though not easier than <b>already done</b>, of course!).<br></p><p>Then of course there is the fact that Rae Dawn Chong (of NH) and I (of WA) are both in <b>Blue</b> states, and thus even though both us are presumably going to vote, our actual votes will not really have influence over the election itself, even if you multiplied each of us by many times in our respective states.</p><p>I have a colleague who really does not like Obama much, so he has stated that he doesn't plan to vote for him. But he has the same problem, one step worse -- trapped in a <b>Blue</b> state, the region will carry the person who he really doesn't want to win.</p><p>In theory if we wanted our votes to "count" in the sense of having influence in a state that is "in play", all three of us would be sure to reside/be registered in a state like Ohio or somewhere that the results really depend on heavy voter turnout of whoever we want to win. If we brought enough of our friends with us, we might not even mind so much living on the wrong color state. But this is really not such a practical strategy, so one whole I think we are stuck with not mattering....</p><p>A largish chunk of my family actually does live in Ohio. In a generally Northern and bluer area (sans Kentucky twang type accent easier to find as one heads towards Columbus and areas further south) though at least one of them is virtually<font size="1"><sup>5</sup></font> guaranteed to vote Republican. Which leads to the other question -- does it show one to be more patriotic if they work<font size="1"><sup>6</sup></font>  harder to make sure their vote counts by living somewhere that it will?<br></p>

<p><font size="1">1 - Well, she lives in New Hampshire so technically I think it was afternoon for her?<br>2 - The actress, and a person whose commentary on life and such I am finding to pretty interesting these days.<br>3 - Yes, as far as I know, it is actually her. Though there are many profiles on facebook that are not real so the skepticism is understood.<br>4 - Well, one state.<br>5 - Though in 2004, the choice was reportedly made to vote Democrat rather than Republican.<br>6 - After having lived in various parts of Ohio for 12 years of my life, I feel qualified to say that living in Ohio can be hard work, sometimes!<br></font></p>

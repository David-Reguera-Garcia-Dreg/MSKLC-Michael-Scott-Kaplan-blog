<P><FONT color=#ff0000><I>This blog is entirely off-topic and carries the same parental warning that Liz Phair's <B>Exile in Guyville</B> album already has, since that is where quoted lyrics are from....</I></FONT><BR></P>
<P>There are friends of mine who think I am a huge fan of Aimee Mann, following her performances as often as I can.</P>
<P>That is probably true; Aimee is truly amazing. <BR></P>
<P>But those people have probably never seen me spend any length of time at a Liz Phair performance! :-)<BR></P>
<P>The first time I saw her was in September of 1993 at the Metro. I flew there, and it was worth it.<BR></P>
<P>The setlist was the <B>Exile In Guyville</B>, which was easy enough to remember. </P>
<P>By the time that show happened (many months after I had bought the album and missed seeing her several times prior in New York and Michigan) I think I had the album pretty much memorized anyway.</P>
<P>I was less than 10 days before my 23rd birthday.</P>
<P>If memory serves, I knew everything.</P>
<P>If you've been 23 you probably know what I mean.</P>
<P>Recently diagnosed with MS (the first time) , even more recently divorced, recently kind of required to move out of my apartment so that my roommate and her partner could live together, it was an interesting time in my life.</P>
<P>And the album just resonated with me.</P>
<P>So, last night, just a little over 10 days after my 38th birthday, and fifteen years since <B>Exile in Guyville</B>, with Liz Phair in town playing in Seattle, I was ready to miss Obama and McCain fighting like little kids to see her playing again.</P>
<P>She was going to play the whole album, beginning to end.</P>She didn't, for what it's worth. But that's another story. 
<P>She starts of course, just as <B>Exile</B> did, with <B>6'1"</B>:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=1><I><FONT face="times new roman,times">I bet you fall in bed too easily<BR>With the beautiful girls who are shyly brave<BR>And you sell yourself as a man to save<BR>But all the money in the world is not enough<BR><BR>I bet you've long since passed understanding <BR>What it takes to be satisfied<BR>You're like a vine that keeps climbing higher<BR>But all the money in the world is not enough<BR>And all the bridges blown away keep floating up<BR><BR>Its cold<BR>And rough<BR>And I kept standing 6'1" <BR>Instead of 5'2"<BR>And I loved my life<BR>And I hated you</FONT></I></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>After the song, she pauses to explain: "<B>It is good to do this album again in its entirety, cause I kind of sucked at it the first time...</B>"</P>
<P>That was awesome. It really was.</P>
<P>And everyone there is eating it up. No one who isn't there isn't completely there, if you know what I mean.</P>
<P>For all of those who didn't already know that she was gong to do just do the whole album? We all knew now... </P>
<P>If ever there was a time to gird one's loins, this would be it. Truly! <BR></P>
<P>Then comes <B>Help Me, Mary</B>, and the words pour over me:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=1><I><FONT face="times new roman,times">Help me Mary please.<BR>I've lost my home to your thieves<BR>They bully the stereo and drink<BR>They leave suspicious things in the sink<BR><BR>They make rude remarks about me<BR>They wonder just how wild I would be<BR>As they egg me on and keep me mad<BR>They play me like a pit bull in a basement, and for that<BR><BR>I lock my door at night<BR>I keep my mouth shut tight<BR>I practice all my moves<BR>I memorize their stupid rules<BR><BR>I make myself their friend<BR>I show them just how far I can bend<BR>As they egg me on and keep me mad<BR>They play me like a pit bull in a basement, and for that<BR><BR>I'm asking, will you, Mary, please<BR>Temper my hatred with peace<BR>Weave my disgust into fame<BR>And watch how fast they run to the flame</FONT></I></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>I notice I am softly singing along with the lyrics. </P>
<P>Suddenly, I am happy that all of the people who would have otherwise gone with me had presidential debates to watch or classes to go to or hair to wash or bellybutton lint to remove or whatever. </P>
<P>This is like a fetish for me, and one should never share a fetish with someone if you'd like them to respect you. :-) <BR></P>
<P>I notice a woman nearby me, her eyes half-closed, doing the same thing, mouthing the lyrics.<BR></P>
<P>We both lock gazes and then quickly look away, self-consciously realize we're crazy, but we smile and don't stop.</P>
<P>Then comes <B>Glory</B>, the song that is Liz's poetry to the prose of my Alphabet Soup:<BR></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times" size=1><I>He's got a really big tongue<BR>It rolls way out<BR>Snaking around in the club<BR>It slicks you down<BR>Scratching his face like a bum<BR>He pulls you back<BR>Circa nineteen eighty-one<BR>He pulls you back<BR><BR>You are, you are, shining some glory <BR>You are, you are, shining some glory <BR>On me, on me<BR>You are, you are, shining some glory <BR>You are, you are, shining some glory on me</I></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>She wins, hands down. Though I never would have guessed otherwise....<BR></P>
<P>And then <B>Dance of the Seven Veils</B>. </P>
<P>My New Testament is kind of rusty, but I am pretty sure this is mainly a reference to the dance that Princess what's-her-name did to convince Kind Herod to behead John the Baptist.</P>
<P>Kind of an ironic twist, that: <FONT size=1><BR></FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times" size=1><I>Johhny my love, get out of the business<BR>It makes me wanna rough you up so badly<BR>Makes me wanna roll you up in plastic<BR>Toss you up and pump you full of lead<BR><BR>Johhny my love, get out of the business<BR>The odds are getting fatter by the minute<BR>That I have got a bright and shiny platter<BR>And I am gonna get your heavy head<BR><BR>I only ask because I'm a real cunt in spring<BR>You can rent me by the hour<BR>I know all about the ugly pilgrim thing<BR>Entertainers bring May flowers<BR><BR>So Johnny my love<BR>We got us a witness<BR>Now all we gotta do is get a preacher<BR>He can probably skip the "until death" part<BR>'Cause Johnny my love you're already dead<BR><BR>I only ask because I'm a real cunt in spring<BR>You can rent me by the hour<BR>I know all about the ugly pilgrim thing<BR>Entertainers bring May flowers<BR><BR>May flowers, May flowers, (To You)&nbsp;</I></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>I remember when I was 23 being shocked that she said the word even though I knew it was there. </P>
<P>The only woman I have ever heard in real life who used the word without special emphasis or self-consciousness. </P>
<P>I was shocked then, and although I wasn't completely shocked this time, I suddenly realized that even 15 years later, no one since has been able to use the word the same way. At least not in front of me.<BR></P>
<P>&nbsp;I know I can't, either. I've never said it.<BR></P>
<P>As if reading my mind, she sings <B>Never Said</B>:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I><FONT face="times new roman,times" size=1>I never said nothing<BR>I never said nothing<BR>I never said nothing<BR>I never said nothing<BR><BR>I don't know where you heard it<BR>Don't know who's spreadin' it 'round<BR>All I know is I'm clean as a whistle baby<BR>I didn't utter a sound<BR><BR>I never said nothing<BR>I never said nothing<BR>I never said nothing<BR>I never said nothing<BR><BR>I don't know what they told you<BR>Don't even care what about<BR>All I know is I'm clean as a whistle baby<BR>I didn't let the cat out<BR><BR>So don't look at me sideways<BR>Don't even look me straight on<BR>And don't worry I've got my hands in my pockets, baby<BR>I ain't done anything wrong<BR><BR>I never said nothing<BR>No baby, I never said nothing<BR>I never said nothing<BR>I never said nothing<BR>I never said nothing<BR>No, not to anyone<BR>I never said nothing<BR>I never said nothing<BR>I never said nothing</FONT></I> <BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Did I ever believe anyone who danced that dance and sang that song to me?</P>
<P>It almost begs disbelief and doubt. <BR></P>
<P>And then it's <B>Soap Star Joe</B>, with an interesting allusion or two,= in it.</P>
<P>Like the Athena thing. It doesn't rally suggest th actual myth but yet somehow inspires it anyway: <BR></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=1><I><FONT face="times new roman,times">He's just a hero<BR>In a long line of heroes<BR>Looking for something attractive to save<BR>They say he rode in<BR>On the back of a pickup<BR>And he won't leave town <BR>'til you remember his name<BR><BR>He's just a hero<BR>In a long line of heroes<BR>Looking for some lonely billboard to grace<BR>They say he sprung from the skull of Athena<BR>Think about your own head<BR>And the headache he gave<BR><BR>He's just a hero<BR>In a long line of heroes<BR>Looking for action at a price he can pay<BR>They say he's famous<BR>But no one can prove it<BR>Make him an offer just to see what he'll say<BR><BR>Check out the dashboard lights<BR>Glowing all green and white<BR>He feels safe in the dark<BR>He wears his bluejeans tight<BR><BR>He's just a hero<BR>In a long line of heroes<BR>Looking for something attractive to save<BR>They say he rode in<BR>On the back of a pickup<BR>And he won't leave town <BR>'Til you remember his name<BR><BR>Check out the thinning hair<BR>Check out the aftershave<BR>Check out America<BR>You're looking at it babe </FONT></I></FONT><BR></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>I suddenly realize that I can't even feel the drinks I had only a short time ago.</P>
<P>There is nothing as sobering as this album -- each song is like a shot of White Lightning or something. Truly.</P>
<P>Can she explain why? Can she <B>Explain It To Me</B>?</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=1><I><FONT face="times new roman,times">Head underwater<BR>Keeps getting hotter<BR>Give 'em your medicine<BR>Fame injection<BR>Tell them to jump higher<BR>Tell 'em to run farther<BR>Make 'em measure up<BR>Decades longer than you<BR><BR>Piece it together<BR>It's like weather<BR>Watch him travel<BR>Kiss the gravel<BR>Tell him to jump higher<BR>Tell him to run farther<BR>Make him measure up<BR>Ten times longer than you<BR>Ever should, you never could <BR>Explain them to me, explain them to me</FONT></I></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>I guess she can!</P>
<P>Now in the interim I think I was reading one of those interviews where the song's inspiration was attributed to the notion of a rock star, past their prime and fading.<BR></P>
<P>And then its <B>Canary</B>, a song which I will admit has always freaked me out more than a little bit.</P>
<P>Sometimes when I play the album, I skip past it. It has also never been in any playlist I've put together, either: <BR></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>We aren't even halfway there and I am exhausted. She still looks like a million dollars.</P>
<P>&nbsp;In fact she's <B>Mesmerizing</B>, coincidentally enough. Go figure?</P>
<P>This is a song that grabs me even though I honestly can't say why. I think it is the melody; the lyrics are unfathomable to me:<BR></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=1><I><FONT face="times new roman,times">You said things I wouldn't say<BR>Straight to my face, boy<BR>You tossed the egg up <BR>And I found my hands in place, boy<BR>After backing up as far as you could get<BR>Don't you know nobody parts two rivers met<BR>Don't you know I'm very happy<BR>You know me well<BR>I'm even happier <BR>I like it<BR>I like it<BR><BR>With all of the time in the world to spend it<BR>Wild and unwise<BR>I wanna be mesmerizing too<BR>Mesmerizing too<BR>Mesmerizing to you<BR><BR>With all of the time in the world to spend it<BR>Wild and unwise<BR>I wanna be mesmerizing too<BR>Mesmerizing too<BR>Mesmerizing to you&nbsp;</FONT></I></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>And she is. Mesmerizing, I mean.<BR></P>
<P>I know what's coming next, but I really can't brace myself.</P>
<P>Suddenly we are there and she is singing <B>Fuck and Run</B>:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=1><I><FONT face="times new roman,times">I woke up alarmed<BR>I didn't know where I was at first<BR>Just that I woke up in your arms<BR>And almost immediately I felt sorry<BR>'Cause I didn't think this would happen again<BR>No matter what I could do or say<BR>Just that I didn't think this would happen again<BR>With or without my best intentions, and<BR>What ever happened to a boyfriend<BR>The kind of guy who tries to win you over, and<BR>What ever happened to a boyfriend<BR>The kind of guy who makes love cause he's in it, and<BR><BR>I want a boyfriend<BR>I want a boyfriend<BR>I want all that stupid old shit<BR>Like letters and sodas<BR>Letters and sodas<BR><BR>You got up out of bed<BR>You said you had a lot of work to do<BR>But I heard the rest in your head<BR>And almost immediately I felt sorry<BR>'Cause I didn't think this would happen again<BR>No matter what I could do or say<BR>Just that I didn't think this would happen again<BR>With or without my best intentions, and<BR><BR>I want a boyfriend<BR>I want a boyfriend<BR>I want all that stupid old shit<BR>Like letters and sodas<BR>Letters and sodas<BR><BR>I can feel it in my bones<BR>I'm gonna spend another year alone<BR>It's fuck and run<BR>Fuck and run<BR>Even when I was seventeen<BR>Fuck and run<BR>Fuck and run<BR>Even when I was twelve<BR><BR>You almost felt bad<BR>You said that I should call you up but<BR>I knew much better than that<BR>And almost immediately I felt sorry<BR>'Cause I didn't think this would happen again<BR>No matter what I could do or say<BR>Just that I didn't think this would happen again<BR>With or without my best intentions<BR><BR>And I can feel it in my bones<BR>I'm gonna spend my whole life alone<BR>It's fuck and run<BR>Fuck and run<BR>Even when I was seventeen<BR>Fuck and run<BR>Fuck and run<BR>Even when I was twelve&nbsp;</FONT></I></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&nbsp;She said it. She really did.</P>
<P>No punches pulled, no apologies. </P>
<P>As brutal as truth gets.<BR></P>
<P>Nor does she hold back in the next song, <B>Girls! Girls! Girls</B>:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=1><I><FONT face="times new roman,times">You been around enough to know<BR>That if I want to leave you better let me go<BR>Because I take full advantage<BR>Of every man I meet<BR>I get away almost every day<BR>With what the girls call<BR>What the girls call<BR>What the girls call<BR>The girls call murder<BR><BR>You been around enough to see<BR>That if you think you're it <BR>You better check with me<BR>Because I take full advantage<BR>Of every man I meet<BR>I get away almost every day<BR>With what the girls call<BR>What the girls call<BR>What the girls call... the girls call murder</FONT></I></FONT> </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>No apologies this time, either. </P>
<P>She knows she is in charge, and she's just letting 'em know. <BR></P>
<P>I am reminded of my own divorce, which I have not really thought of that way for over a decade, as <B>The Divorce Song</B> plays.</P>
<P>And suddenly she is in not in charge anymore. The contrast between this song and the one preceding it is astounding:<BR></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>It's all so real. And vulnerable.</P>
<P>I have known people who were unable to listen to that song after their divorces, it was just too real. <BR></P>
<P>As she stars to sing <B>Shatter</B>, the song that is the fantasy of many guys: the bad girl who never felt bad about it until she was with them and realized she wanted to be a better woman.</P>
<P>Doubtful that I have ever truly inspired that in a relationship, I can only watch her sing about it now:<BR></P>

<P>I almost do (shatter, I mean).</P>
<P>Liz has a lady come up on stage from the audience to do the higher, repeating part of <B>Flower</B>:</P>

<P>It is too late to be shocked, truly.</P>
<P>Even so that song makes everything that came before it seem like almost innocent. Which is quite a challenge! <BR></P>
<P>And then, after all that, along comes <B>Johnny Sunshine</B>. He left anyway, it would seem - the one she was singing the previous song to. Like th first Aunt Peg scene out of Talk Dirty To Me, she just scared him off or something:</P>

<P>Throughout, everyone has been cheering. </P>
<P>Though at some point she asked the crowd -- is there anyone else here who hasn't really been listening all the way through to the backside of the album, all these years?</P>
<P>No one cheered that time. Who could skip the end? :-) <BR></P>
<P>I think I would be <B>Gunshy</B> too on this point, though with the exception of the one song I mentioned above that I often intentionally skipped, the other were all okay to hear:<BR></P>

<P>Thinking back I remembered that some people would read the lyrics as "sea monkeys, do monkeys" which did not make very much sense to me.<BR></P>
<P>If I hadn't known, perhaps I'd be happier, but I know the answer even as <B>Stratford-On-Guy</B>:</P>

<P>Some of the best lines ever in that one, and of course now most people won't even know what they mean.</P>
<P>It's like being in a secret with millions and millions of Liz Phair's closest friends or something. <BR></P>
<P>Only one song left, before the <B>Strange Loop</B> of this night moves to wrap up. </P>
<P>With a song that is about a relationship, with a breakup dissecting in the middle.</P>
<P>I am wondering if we ever really do go from happy to not this fast:<BR></P>

<P>Now it is over.</P>
<P>And it is not even 11pm yet I find myself exhausted.</P>
<P>I feel like I have just had 18 string drinks, and I wonder how I could possibly have sat there for the whole show.</P>
<P>She comes out to do a few songs for the encore.</P>
<P>They aren't from the three that were added to the <B>Exile</B> reissue, where are:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Ant in Alaska</LI>
<LI>Say You</LI>
<LI>Instrumentals <BR></LI></UL>
<P>Thanks to the miracle of the Zune store I just bought the three tracks, I played them on the way home on the second-last 545 of the evening.<BR></P>
<P>But to be honest I can't remember what they were. I was too wiped out from the show....<BR></P>
<P>There is only one thing I know for sure -- I wasn't just remembering how I felt 15 years ago when I was 23.</P>
<P>For a little while there, I <B>was</B> 23 again. And all that implies....</P>

<p>The epiphany started with a comment.</p><p>A comment to that blog <b><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/09/24/8963178.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/09/24/8963178.html">Tavultesoft is one of the company names mispronounced more often than Trigeminal</a></b>.</p><p>It was after Andrew Durdin gave the suggested pronunciation <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/09/24/8963178.html#8963952" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/09/24/8963178.html#8963952">here</a> and his brother Marc said more about it <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/09/24/8963178.html#8964218" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/09/24/8963178.html#8964218">here</a>.</p><p>The next day, Marc <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/09/24/8963178.html#8965840" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/09/24/8963178.html#8965840">commented</a>:</p><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p><font size="3">I have been informed (by my parents) that both Andrew and I got the phonetic 
transcription of Tavultesoft wrong. &nbsp;Here's what they suggest is the correct pronunciation: [tɑβʊltɛˈsɔft]ǃ &nbsp;Not quite sure how to turn that into a domain 
name...</font></p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p>I suddenly recalled how often tje relationships we have with our prents zbout names has some very real flaws.</p><p>There are obvious examples, like my Hebrew name. You see, I am a member of the <b>Honorable Society of People Whose Hebrew Names Don't Correspond to Their English Names</b>.</p><p>Thus <b>Michael</b> becomes <font size="3"><b>מאיר</b></font> instead of the more conventional <b><font size="3">מייקל</font></b>.</p><p>And there is my sister's Hebrew name, that someone who our parents consulted just made up -- it isn't even a word! What's up with that?</p><p>Supposedly it was a Rabbi, but that word is based the Hebrew word "My teacher" and clearly he wasn't teaching anything useful that day!<br></p><p>I am not going to spell it here and make the word more of an actual word by making it easier to Google.<br></p><p>Of course there is Goldie's name, which I talked about in <b><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/12/02/6639141.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/12/02/6639141.html">Learning to spell in Bengali (when one doesn't know the language)</a></b>.</p><p>That name (<font size="3">গোধূলি চৌধুরী</font>) was based on a beautiful poem/song by Tagore (it might be a poem though I have heard it sung since then so we'll call it a song), though unfortunately the way she was taught to spell it all her life turns out was wrong.</p><p>Doesn't that work against the beautiful gesture a tad? :-) <br></p><p>I hesitate to ponder how long it would have been before she found out if I had not been on that odd project that I enlisted her in and she involved her parents in!</p><p>And then there is my colleague Daniel.</p><p>Daniel, you see, is from Hawaii.</p><p>Remember when I mention <b><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/09/23/8961799.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/09/23/8961799.html">As the comma turned (in space!)</a></b>?</p><p>Well, his name is <font size="3">Daniel Kamanaʻo</font>.</p><p>I should actually give you the full name, including the middle name (which is decidely more "Hawaiian" than the first name!):</p><p><font size="5">Daniel Keiki Oʻkalani kala hoʻo lewa Kamanaʻo</font></p><p>He also has it on his office door:</p><p><img src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/hawaiian.png"> <br></p><p>If you know Hawaiian you will know why this is kind of a cool name. And even if you don't, you can delight in imagining how the software developers who were hyperventilating trying to solve the problems in <b><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/08/08/8842654.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/08/08/8842654.html">What's in a name?</a></b> would be having a coronary trying to handle Daniel's name.</p><p>Now this is not the name on his birth certificate.</p><p>The name there is something like:<br></p><p><font size="5">Daniel Keiki kalahoʻolewa oʻkakakakalani Kamanao</font></p><p>Now let's not even talk about the missing <b>okina</b> in the last name.</p><p>Let's focus on the middle.</p><p>It is kind of ironic in both the actual sense and the Alanis sense the way that the <b>kaka</b> bit is repeated, given that <b>kaka</b> is often used to mean crap. They stuck some random "crap" in the middle of his name that has no meaning in Hawaiian!</p><p>So, there are many morals/lessons one could get from all of this, including how cool it is to be in contact with so many people with so many different languages and cultures.</p><p>But I prefer the one that was the source of my epiphany -- <b>Parents just really suck at names</b>. :-)<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><font color="#ff00ff"><i>This blog brought to you by</i><font size="7"> ʻ

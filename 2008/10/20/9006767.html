<p>It was last last week when colleague, comrade, and regular reader Jonas Barklund sent me some mail:</p><blockquote><p><i><font face="times new roman,times"><b>Subject:</b> All links on page http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/archive/2006/05/30/610605.aspx appear dead<br><br> A victim of one of MSDNâ€™s total reshuffles?</font></i></p></blockquote><p>Well I suppose that could be the reason why all of the links in <b><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/05/30/610605.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/05/30/610605.html">Its a whole new way to look at MUI</a></b>, <i><font color="#ff0000">which I admit I listed out mainly for dramatic effect so you could see that the page I was trying to get people to look at had some intrinsic value</font></i>, suddenly don't seem to work, even though <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms776223.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms776223.aspx">the main MUI node</a> is still there and all of the topics still seem to be somewhere. Just not in the exact same place for most of them.</p><p>None of the links on the page had special value for me, though any one of them could have special value for some reader.</p><p>Which in my mind make the fact that so many things were moved a bad thing -- anyone who went to one of those links and saved it since they linked it will have the same problem.</p><p>Perhaps next time or just in the future I'll have to be more careful about links to conceptual topics; their half life seems to be considerably shorter than those of the function topics....</p><p>Sorry about that, everyone!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><font color="#ff1493" face="Tahoma"><i>This post brought to you by</i> <font size="6"><b>M</b></font> <i>(<a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/004d">U+004d</a>, a.k.a.

<p><strong>jmdesp</strong> on 21 Oct 2008 6:08 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Yes, and as Tim said also : &quot;the only good reason for a document to disappear from the Web is that the company which owned the domain name went out of business or can no longer afford to keep the server running.&quot;</p>
<p>Microsoft needs to learn better ! Constantly changing the MSDN url is just ludicrous. </p>
<p>Why the hell, why *you* the /manager/ people at Microsoft behind this non-sense *spend* so much money in order to have great documentation and then do your best so that people can't access it !? I know money is the only thing that counts for you, and I tell you you are wasting it by doing that.</p></div>

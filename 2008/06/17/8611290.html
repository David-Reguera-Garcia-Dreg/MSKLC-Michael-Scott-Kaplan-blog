<P>Microsoft program manager Garrett McGowan&nbsp;mentioned yesterday:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><EM><FONT face="times new roman,times">Please compile Audiosurf as a Unicode application. Surely the game isn't supported on Win9x? Around 15 percent of my music collection is unavailable in the game because the album and song metadata...</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A class="" href="http://www.audio-surf.com/" mce_href="http://www.audio-surf.com/">This</A> is the site where you can read about Audiosurf.</P>
<P>Dag Mitchell, is there really an excuse for this kind of thing anymore?</P>
<P>Huge parts of the game industry have moved to Unicode, it really is unfortunate that holdovers like this still happen along.</P>
<P>Now lots of people have been complaining about this, like <A class="" href="http://www.audio-surf.com/forum/index.php?topic=240.150" mce_href="http://www.audio-surf.com/forum/index.php?topic=240.150">here</A> in their forums and in blogs like <A class="" href="http://blog.jeffgerstmann.net/2008/01/18/audiosurf/" mce_href="http://blog.jeffgerstmann.net/2008/01/18/audiosurf/">this one</A>. People have been pointing out this problem for months now, and it really is time they paid attention to the complaints....</P>

<hr/><p><strong>Andrew Cook</strong> on 17 Jun 2008 12:31 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>The problem is not with Audiosurf itself. Audiosurf is not an &quot;application&quot; in the traditional sense, in the same way that games on Kongregate (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.kongregate.com/">http://www.kongregate.com/</a>) or in Adobe Shockwave Shockmachine (now retired) aren't applications. They instead rely on third-party engines, in this case Quest3D by Act-3D b.v. which isn't Unicode-compiled. Unfortunately, Quest3D /is/ used for Windows 9X applications -- for some reason -- so the makers of Audiosurf are stuck.</p>
<p>The good news is that the Unicode-as-ANSI does not appear to prevent access to any song nor break statistics in any way.</p></div>

<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 18 Jun 2008 3:07 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Actually, I have proven on many occasions that I am completely willing to criticize Microsoft products with globalization problems such as piss-poor Unicode support, too.</p>
<p>Flamebait denied -- and everybody screwing up support here can find themselves a target, sorry! :-)</p>

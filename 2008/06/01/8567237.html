<P>When I saw the name of this particular technology (<STRONG>Live Mesh</STRONG>), I admit that the image it inspired was probably not the one the team specifically&nbsp;intended<FONT size=1><SUP>1,2</SUP></FONT>.</P>
<P>But I have had&nbsp;a few&nbsp;people who had been following blogs up on the <A class="" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/livemesh" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/livemesh">Live Mesh Blog</A>&nbsp;such as:</P>
<UL>
<LI><A class="" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/livemesh/archive/2008/04/28/get-mesh-and-why-we-require-uac.aspx" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/livemesh/archive/2008/04/28/get-mesh-and-why-we-require-uac.aspx">Get Mesh (and why we require UAC)</A></LI>
<LI><A class="" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/livemesh/archive/2008/05/20/service-update-new-build-released.aspx" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/livemesh/archive/2008/05/20/service-update-new-build-released.aspx">Service update: New build released</A></LI></UL>
<P>who wanted to know what I thought about the limitations related to international.</P>
<P>To be honest, the blogs have not been entirely descriptive about what the limitations are, but I'll use a bit of Forensic Globalization Review to see if I can figure out what we're talking about.</P>
<P>It&nbsp;is clear that in the initial release&nbsp;or at least&nbsp;the one available about the time of first cited&nbsp;blog (from April 28th) that there were limitations relating to both&nbsp;<STRONG>region</STRONG> (presumably GEOID) and "<STRONG>OS language</STRONG>"; further, the were bugs related to <STRONG>ASCII user name limitations</STRONG> and <STRONG>date formats</STRONG>.</P>
<P>And by looking at the comments of the second blog cited above, it is clear that of these four issues cited&nbsp;in the previous sentence&nbsp;they fixed everything other than the "<STRONG>OS language</STRONG>".</P>
<P>However, as <A class="" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/livemesh/archive/2008/05/20/service-update-new-build-released.aspx#8531143" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/livemesh/archive/2008/05/20/service-update-new-build-released.aspx#8531143">this</A> comment from n-blue indicates:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><EM><FONT face="times new roman,times">My Vista is English version but this update still show same error. It want english version of vista. I think you show the wrong error, only date time and unicode is non-eng but the OS is Eng.</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The meaning of "<STRONG>OS language</STRONG>" in the Live Mesh communications is neither the <STRONG>SKU language</STRONG> nor the <STRONG>user interface language</STRONG> -- it actually appears to be the <STRONG>default system locale</STRONG>, aka the <STRONG>Language for non-Unicode programs</STRONG>!!!</P>
<P>This looks like a bit of bad terminology in their explanation of the limitation, and of course the problem of the limitation itself (there is no good reason when one has all the choices I describe in <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/02/01/364707.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/02/01/364707.html"><STRONG>What is my locale? Well, which locale do you mean?</STRONG></A> to choose the <STRONG>default system locale</STRONG> for anything.</P>
<P>So I would say there are those two problems remaining, plus a third possible problem related to getting enough invites out, worldwide....</P>
<P>The UAC thing is also kind of lame but that was broken by Vista (not Live Mesh), and really has nothing to do with internationalization so it isn't relevant here.</P>

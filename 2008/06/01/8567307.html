<h1>On passive vocabulary (aka ennui about chaos)</h1>

<P>I used to read a lot.</P>
<P>Well, technically I still do. But these days I read specs and standards and blogs; what I used to read was books.</P>
<P>It gave me lots of things, but the thing I'm thinking about here is the huge&nbsp;passive vocabulary I ended up with.</P>
<P>All of those words I learned either by </P>
<UL>
<LI>looking up words I read and did not understand so I&nbsp; could understand them, or</LI>
<LI>gaining understanding directly from where I read them.</LI></UL>
<P>Now in both of the above cases there are risks with the self-directed nature of the activity -- I could look up the wrong word, I could pick the wrong definition, I could misunderstand the meaning, or the meaning I accept might be wrong.</P>
<P>But on the whole these risks are obviated by the fact that a lot of imperfect knowledge is right more often then ignorance can be, and also by the fact that in many cases a passive vocabulary remains passive -- so that the words don't find themselves used by me as often as they might be heard when said by others. which gives me the chance to correct misunderstandings internally....</P>
<P>A great example of this came up in&nbsp;a recent appearance of Christina Ricci on <STRONG>Late Night with Conan O'Brien</STRONG>:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>Ricci</STRONG>: My sister wanted to be a school teacher so she taught me how to read when I was really young. There were four kids, my parents were kind of busy and we read to ourselves a lot, so I would look up words and not hear them read to me so I would think that they're pronounced other ways and like stick with that pronunciation so like every time someone says chaos <STRONG>[kay-oss]</STRONG>&nbsp;I think chaos <STRONG>[chowss]</STRONG>, because that was... and I really thought it was chaos <STRONG>[chowss]</STRONG>&nbsp;until I was like 11 or 12 and my mother was picking me up from school and there were like kids everywhere and buses and I said God it's other chaos <STRONG>[chowss] </STRONG>out here and my mother just cracked up hysterically and was like did you mean chaos <STRONG>[kay-oss]</STRONG>?<BR><BR><STRONG>O'Brien</STRONG>:The big way out is "I've heard it both ways"</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P mce_keep="true">I could tell my own personal story of ennui (and the related&nbsp;<STRONG>[en-you-eye]</STRONG> vs. <STRONG>[on-wee]</STRONG> snafu), which I thought was funnier. But it was also much more embarrassing for me personally. </P>
<P mce_keep="true">So I'll give Christina this one, as </P>
<UL>
<LI>
<DIV mce_keep="true">discretion is the better part of valor, and </DIV></LI>
<LI>
<DIV mce_keep="true">telling stories that make one look foolish is the better part of embarrassment.</DIV></LI></UL>
<P mce_keep="true">Besides, the really important people who know me have already heard the story anyway. :-)</P>

<p>As a result, I ended up with many weird pronunciation problems. &nbsp;The most memorable was being in my teens before I found out that the opposite of &quot;Catholic&quot; was not &quot;Pro-test-tant&quot;.</p></div>
<p><strong>John Cowan</strong> on 4 Jun 2008 2:15 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Ken: Spelling reform duzn't actually have to be phonetically based. &nbsp;Just remooving the *completely* irregular spellings from the system, so that each spelling has oenly wun or too sounds associated with it (but not vice versa), makes aul the difference in the wurld. &nbsp;(This is Regularized Inglish, invented by Axel Wijk; it probably makes more distinctions than yoor dialect duz, so sum spellings may seem a bit unnatural.)</p>
<p>Ikk's -omb words become combe, bomb, and toombe respectively, extending the &quot;silent final e&quot; convention to make vowels long.</p>
<p>I doen't think Noah Webster's chainges (or rather his standardization of chainges that were aulreddy in the air at the time) had nearly the impact on Inglish of the Norman Conquest, tho.</p></div>

<h1>I am not engaged, everyone!</h1>

<P>I will readily admit I am not much of a texter. </P>
<P>I said as much to someone who was texting me late last year:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG><FONT face=arial,helvetica,sans-serif>Do you text message? It's what <BR>young people do these days.</FONT></STRONG></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Nothing makes you feel older than phrases like that, I always say....</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the answer to the question was mostly no. I have text'ed with the folks who have text'ed me from time to time, but I never really got into it, or very good at it.</P>
<P>I guess I'm just not one of the young people....</P>
<P><EM>That message I quote above has not scrolled off my phone yet, and the scrolling happens at 50 text messages. So that might be a hint at how seldom I use this feature of my phone! :-)</EM></P>
<P>Though the one I got from my sister yesterday was pretty funny:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG><FONT face=arial,helvetica,sans-serif>Are you engaged and haven't told<BR>us?</FONT></STRONG></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Apparently one of them saw <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/06/25/8650800.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/06/25/8650800.html"><STRONG>So logical that even Mr. Spock (and my fiancée?) would approve</STRONG></A> and took my kind of joking claim that</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><EM>even if you were right (a point that I would probably not agree with you about unless we were in public and were going to get married (as I think it is best to never disagree with one's fiancée in public!)</EM> </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>was really just intended as hyperbole and thought maybe I was hinting at something. :-)</P>
<P>I also got email from two other people on the same subject (did it really seem like a hint? I don't think I am <STRONG>that</STRONG> oblique here!), but just the one text message. I'm really not that good with the texting. Maybe it's the speed of it all? I don't do twitter either (you may have heard of the latter, it is like blogging for people with <A class="" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention-Deficit_Disorder" mce_href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention-Deficit_Disorder">ADD</A> who haven't been taking their Ritalin). Texting seems more common but only the people younger than I seem to be doing it (which includes my sister!)....</P>

<P>My group did not fund my trip to Orlando.</P>
<P>Well to be completely technical, since I flew with a rewards ticket on Alaska, and since almost all of my Alaska miles post breakup with the two&nbsp;women who lived in LA and North Hollywood respectively&nbsp;have been trips funded by my group, I guess they did indirectly fund the travel.</P>
<P>They did not pay fees for me to get into TechEd, and are not paying for my hotel room.</P>
<P>Just so people who are worried about budget squandering can move along, as there is nothing to see here.... :-)</P>
<P>I may have been talked into a few Tech Talks, a panel, and maybe even booth time. This would all be for another group in Microsoft. More on these items as they unfold.</P>
<P>Otherwise, I'm just here to visit and hang out and go to the parties. If you are at TechEd and see me, feel free to say hi -- if you wave, I'll wave back!</P>

<p>Everyone knows frequent flyer miles are impossible to use. If your claim were even remotely possible, Seattle would be empty this time of year, with people escaping the rain to go somewhere warm and sunny.</p></div>

<P>I am on Hanselminutes once again, good old number #117.</P>
<P>(I mentioned Hanselminutes previously in posts like <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/08/02/686384.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/08/02/686384.html"><STRONG>this one</STRONG></A>).</P>
<P>Scott and I blather about internationalization, localization, and more for a half hour or so, you can listen to&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT size=4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hanselminutes #117 and/or download it from </FONT><A class="" href="http://hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=135" mce_href="http://hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=135"><FONT size=4>here</FONT></A><FONT size=4>. </FONT></P>
<P>I play it on double speed in WMP and shake my head at how ll over the map we ended up being, both literally and figuratively....</P>
<P>Now we&nbsp;have known each other for years now and we talk about the bug that first introduced us to each other, how to&nbsp;get Vista to support more languages, why Turkish cases differently, how to sing the Alphabet song in Amharic, why Kashmir doesn't have&nbsp;a locale, how Ethiopic is made up word, why I failed penmanship, how to pronounce MUI,&nbsp;and more.</P>
<P>Enjoy!</P>
<P><FONT size=1>By the way (while I am sorta talking about TechEd), am I the only one freaked out about how Mark Miller was simply "disappeared" from the schedule? If&nbsp;I disappear&nbsp;over the weekend or some time next week, it might be because I am asking the question here and I am a little nervous about that. But does anyone know for sure what's going on?</FONT></P>

<p>So the report that came in (about the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/bb964651.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/bb964651.aspx">Windows Keyboard Layouts</a> discussed <b><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/08/27/8898859.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/08/27/8898859.html">previously</a></b>) was an interesting one:</p><blockquote><p><i><font face="times new roman,times">For the Korean keyboard, I think the KOR and ENG buttons are reversed.</font></i></p></blockquote><p>Now this is one of those interesting philosophical issues, where one has to decide if toggle keys on a keyboard that changes its display should display the current state of the keyboard or the state that one is moving to by hitting the toggle. Thus the current design:</p><p><img src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/perspective09.png"> &nbsp; <img src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/perspective10.png"></p><p>Now one could argue that this is confusing, this use of the button text as showing the "current status" rather than showing the status when you press it.</p><p>It is how both the Japanese and Korean IME keyboard layouts work, with ToolTips that provide additional information when you hover:</p><p><img src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/perspective01.png">&nbsp; <img src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/perspective02.png"></p><p>where <b>Kor</b> is a reasonable abbreviation for <b>Korean</b> and <b>Eng</b> is a reasonable abbreviation for <b>English</b> <br></p><p><img src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/perspective03.png">&nbsp; <img src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/perspective04.png"></p><p>where <font size="4">ひら</font> is a reasonable abbreviation for Hiragana (<font size="4">ひらがな</font>) in Hiragana and <font size="4">カタ</font> is a reasonable abbreviation for Katakana (<font size="4">カタカナ</font>) in Katakana.<br></p><p><img src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/perspective05.png">&nbsp; <img src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/perspective06.png"></p><p><img src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/perspective07.png">&nbsp; <img src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/perspective08.png"></p><p>where <font size="4"><b>半</b></font> really does mean "half" and <font size="4"><b>全</b></font> really does mean "all" or "full".</p><p>There is a pattern here..... <br></p><p>Clearly this is not just a tiny mistake in a single layout --&nbsp; this is an explicit, conscious design choice.</p><p>I can't compare against a soft keyboard like the Optimus since I couldn't get it to shown the Japanese layout.</p><p>Other keys like the CAPS LOCK key do not change to indicate their status other than to look <span style="font-weight: bold;">pressed</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">not pressed</span> -- in their own way they follow the same design since their display indicates the state they qre in, not the state that pressing them makes.</p><p>And this design choice has its uses -- like when they are put on websites (like this
one) or in appendices in books (like mine, or DIS v.2) and the are in no way dynamic
-- they become self-documenting. <br></p><p>But in the end I think this one really could be argued either way, really.</p><p>There is no right answer.</p><p>It's all a matter of perspective.... :-)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><font color="#ff00ff"><i>This blog brought to you by</i><font size="5"> 半 </font><i>(<a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/534a" mce_href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/534a">U+534a</a>, a CJK UNIFIED IDEOGRAPH)</i></font> <br></p>

<p>Imagine a button that changes style between Roman-Hiragana-Katakana-Kanji. If I am in Roman mode, a &quot;next state button&quot; will show Hiragana, but I still don't know how to get to the other two states.</p>
<p>With &quot;current state button&quot; at least I know where I am.</p></div>
<p><strong>John Cowan</strong> on 5 Sep 2008 1:06 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>This is related to the user-interface question: given a viewport into a canvas, does scrolling up move the canvas up, or the viewport up? &nbsp;Scroll bars and Page Up/Down universally use the first convention, but I have seen novices fumble with them because they expected the viewport to move -- when you tilt your head up, after all, you see a higher area of the world, corresponding to a viewport movement.</p>
<p>(Annoyingly, CTRL+mousewheel, which changes font sizes in Firefox, makes the font bigger when you move the wheel upward in FF3, but smaller in FF2. &nbsp;Those of us who have to use both, and don't have little teeny eyes for reading little teeny print on the Web, suffer from this.) </p></div>

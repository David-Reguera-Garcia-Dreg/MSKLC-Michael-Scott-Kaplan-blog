<p><font color="#ff0000"><i>I admit I was tempted to really do up the Destiny's Child lyrics completely just like the title, but I decided if I ain't going to write the IME below that it would be kind of obnoxious to put that much time into a Yankovikian tribute like that....</i></font><br></p><p>Less than half a day ago, conradoplg asked in the Suggestion Box:</p><blockquote><p><i><font face="times new roman,times">In one of your blogs you explain a method to type random Unicode points with an unicode IME.<br><br>But this is driving me nuts for some time now. Is there a way to enter random Unicode points by their *names*? I can't possibly know the hex code of all the characters!<br><br>What I'm talking about is some kind of IME where you would type a character name and it would show a list of candidates where you could choose.<br><br>Is there such a thing? Or more importantly, could one (who doesn't work for Microsoft :) ) implement it? Is it possible to write an IME?<br><br>Thanks!</font></i></p></blockquote><p>That just inspired me, so I pushed a bit of the rotation foward for it. :-)</p><p>Now there is no built-in way to do this, no.</p><p>But the <a href="http://www.unicode.org/ucd/" mce_href="http://www.unicode.org/ucd/">Unicode Character Database</a>, and more specifically the ~1.1mb <a href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UnicodeData.txt" mce_href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UnicodeData.txt">UnicodeData.txt</a>, is available. </p><p>Writing an IME can be really difficult.

<p><strong>John Cowan</strong> on 5 Sep 2008 12:59 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>An alternative possibility is to use the W3C's consolidated list of XML entity names (drawn from the HTML, MathML, and various ISO sets). &nbsp;This is still in working-draft state, but the sources are pretty stable, and most of the names are short and fairly mnemonic. &nbsp;It won't let you type text in arbitrary scripts, but it does handle a good many symbols.</p>
<p>See <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-entity-names">http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-entity-names</a> for the writeup; the current actual list is at <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.w3.org/2003/entities/2007/w3centities-f.ent">http://www.w3.org/2003/entities/2007/w3centities-f.ent</a> .</p></div>

<p>I'll try to make something with the Table Driven Text Service, probably with just a few characters that I use often.</p></div>

<p>Okay, I know I promised I was done, but after <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/09/10/8939273.html" class="" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/09/10/8939273.html"><b>It is the [unexpected] gratitude from people you respect that makes a [stubborn] Bulldog feels best!</b></a>, where I mentioned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="times new roman,times">Rick then said some very nice things and I accepted the award that I think I was too dazed to remember (I'll wait till hey update the Bulldog page to find out for sure -- I now know why Oscar winners forget stuff in their speeches!)</font></p></blockquote>
<p>Sarasvati manifested and in&nbsp;Her divine effulgence&nbsp;took pity on her lowly servant and&nbsp;forwarded the text used by Rick when the award was presented.</p>
<p>Here it is, for the curious:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><font face="times new roman,times">It's been a few years since we have given out a Unicode bulldog award.&nbsp; <br>This year, we would like to honor someone who has been a long-time&nbsp; <br>presenter at these conferences, and many of you probably know him.<br><br>Michael Kaplan is such a true friend of Unicode, and so dedicated to&nbsp; <br>supporting the cause, that his tiny company once joined at the full member&nbsp; <br>level, so that he could have a vote in the UTC on topics of importance.&nbsp; <br>(This makes him one of two individuals who have ever joined as full&nbsp; <br>members... For tonight's trivia quiz: who was the other person?)<br><br>Even without his vote, Michael's voice and his passion would be hard to&nbsp; <br>miss. He has blogged about Unicode and supported the Consortium for many&nbsp; <br>years, first through his own company and later through his work at&nbsp; <br>Microsoft.<br><br>Please join me in welcoming Michael to the ranks of the Unicode Bulldogs.</font></i></p></blockquote>
<p>For the record, the cost of full membership in Unicode was USD$12,000 at the time; it is now USD$18,000. </p><p>The maximum approved spending limit to prove a point in my comparatively smaller company is USD$14,995, so it is lucky that that Unicode didn't raise the rate until recently, or I'd have only had a half vote. :-)<br></p><p>Another interesting bit here.</p><p>Something that I had not realized initially (a colleague down the&nbsp;hall&nbsp;pointed it out to me later) and that I thought at first was an error....</p>
<p>If you look at the <a href="http://unicode.org/conference/bulldog.html" mce_href="http://unicode.org/conference/bulldog.html">Unicode Bulldog Award</a>&nbsp;page that lists the past recipients:</p>

<p>It appears that I'm the only person from Microsoft to be&nbsp;granted&nbsp;the award. Well, so far, at least.<br></p>
<p>Kind of cool!</p><p>For that reason, I think I'll mention it officially now, since a lot of the effort took place while I was an employee and Microsoft has been very supportive of it for the bulk of that time -- this means that they deserve some of the glory too as much of it would have been if not impossible then at least less feasible without Microsoft's involvement here.<br></p>
<p>Okay, now I officially done. I am way over quota for this kind of thing! :-)<br></p>

<p><strong>Andrew West</strong> on 13 Sep 2008 12:19 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>&quot;I think that the cost of the membership is to high&quot; -- there are a range of membership options, starting from $50 p.a. for a student (see &quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.unicode.org/consortium/levels.html"">http://www.unicode.org/consortium/levels.html&quot;</a>). I guess that full membership is not too expensive for big corporations such as Microsoft.</p>
<p>BTW, it looks like full membership is currently a bargain at only $15,000 p.a. At this price a few rich kids with a mischievous streak could hijack the Unicode consortium and play havoc with the future of character encoding.</p></div>

<p>It was Lloyd Anderson, if that helps. :-)</p>

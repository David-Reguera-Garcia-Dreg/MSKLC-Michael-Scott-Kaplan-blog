Forget about the <b><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/02/17/533929.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/02/17/533929.html">base character combined with a buttload of diacritics</a></b> scenario, there are plenty of valid scenarios too. But none of them are the default case, or the most common scenarios.</p><p>To be honest, after considering situations like <b><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/04/22/8415727.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/04/22/8415727.html">Vowel DISharmony?, aka The case of the missing dot</a></b>, anyon who thinks that the biggest problem here is a split surrogate pair (which would show that square box something like an unknown character) and not the linguistic characters potentially stripped of their actual meaning and validity, likely needs a vacation.<br></p><p>They're important, sure. But they are not world stoppers (or if they are, then they were evn back when the application claimed to support Unicode yet clipped diacritics just as indiscriminately and probably more often).</p><p>Thus the first and most important point is that we need to upgrade the question into somethin more meaningful, something that covers what we are actually trying to accomplish.</p><p>Next time I'll start talking about the cases where one ought to care, and how to make sure it a productive kind of caring.</p><p><br></p><p><font color="#ff1493"><i>This post brought to you by</i><font size="5">

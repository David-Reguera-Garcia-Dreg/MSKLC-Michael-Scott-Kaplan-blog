<p style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-style: italic;">One to file under the "I thought I was blind all those years until I suddenly realized my hat was two sizes too large" category. :-)</p><p>In the past I described in blogs like <b><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/08/17/4440496.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/08/17/4440496.html">Some blog boggles and a few disclaimers</a></b> my use of the term <b>moronic wingnut</b> and how some people really didn't like the term.</p><p>It turns out that at least one of the reasons might be the Safirishly suggested connection between the term <b>wingnut</b> and the extreme <b>right wing</b> side of politics.</p><p>Now although <b><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/01/15/7103490.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/01/15/7103490.html">I did repost the Wanker-wingnut continuum</a></b>, where the term <b>wingnut</b> is clearly used in this way, my mind was on something else entirely when I started using with the term.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">(By the way, it looks like </span><a href="http://thepoorman.net/" style="font-style: italic;" mce_href="http://thepoorman.net/">The Poor Man</a><span style="font-style: italic;"> is </span><a href="http://thepoorman.net/2008/01/15/return-with-honor/" style="font-style: italic;" mce_href="http://thepoorman.net/2008/01/15/return-with-honor/">back</a><span style="font-style: italic;">, though all of the old content is gone. Though still worth the read if that is your taste!)</span><br></p><p>For me it dated back to those RPS days I mentioned <b><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/04/16/408841.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/04/16/408841.html">before</a></b>.</p><p>It was a shift where someone in the trucks was doing something particularly stupid.</p><p>Not the ordinary kind of stupid one might expect from the type of person who voluntarily agrees to unload packages inside tandem trailers getting up to high temperatures for four hours for wages that really did not make it worth the time.</p><p>I mean really stupid stuff.</p><p>Like sending hazardous packages up the belt which led to a downward incline where packages would slide down to people sorting them out by destination.</p><p>This was NEVER supposed to be done, since if such a package turned out to have a leak, then some kind of hazardous substance would be leaking down on one of the sorters, which would be very dangerous.</p><p>Anyway, one day someone kept doing this, and Jason (the guy wearing a tie and supervising the shift), yelled down to the guy who was doing this an who thought it was such a hoot "<b>Will ya cut it out, ya wingnut?!?</b>" and for me, in this warehouse from the early '90's, the use of the word <b>wingnut</b> was born.</p><p>In a completely non-partisan way.</p><p>Anyway, the other day someone suggested to me that this kind of a read of the term <b>wingnut</b> might be why someone took the term <b>moronic wingnut</b> as being so offensive. You know, if they thought that I was dragging down republicans or something.</p><p>Just for the record, I swear that my usage pre-dates the bloggers phenomenon Willian Safire pointed out and that it is non-partisan and really an equal opportunity kind of an opportunity. Regardless of age, race, gender, political status, sexual orientation, sexual preference, hair color, eye color, or any other openly or covertly distinguishing feature.</p><p>It is an equal opportunity slam for when people misquote me. :-)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><font color="#ff1493" face="Tahoma"><em>This post brought to you by</em><font size="6"> + </font><em>(<a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/002b">U+002b</a>, a.k.a.

<p>The other day, Adrian Cadden sent me some email, curious about why I hadn't been blogging about Silverlight localization.</p><p>I had to admit that the main reason was that I didn't know very much about it, and didn't really know of anyone who did!</p><p>But then I got to change all that, when he pointed out that in his blog he was doing some coverage of Internationalizing Silverlight in a blog with the title <a href="http://wpf-e.spaces.live.com/default.aspx" mce_href="http://wpf-e.spaces.live.com/default.aspx">Silverlight and International Thoughts</a>.<br></p><p>I'll probably be digging in here at some point as I hasve a backlog of interesting mails about some related topics about WPF that occasionally touched on Silverlight. I just haven't really tried anything myself just yet....</p><p>With recent topics like <a href="http://wpf-e.spaces.live.com/blog/cns%212B248D261D0E0035%21232.entry" mce_href="http://wpf-e.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!2B248D261D0E0035!232.entry">Silverlight Marketization (Market Customization)</a>, <a href="http://wpf-e.spaces.live.com/blog/cns%212B248D261D0E0035%21250.entry" mce_href="http://wpf-e.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!2B248D261D0E0035!250.entry">Silverlight Localizability and Pseudo-Localization</a>, and <a href="http://wpf-e.spaces.live.com/blog/cns%212B248D261D0E0035%21264.entry" mce_href="http://wpf-e.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!2B248D261D0E0035!264.entry">Silverlight : on demand culture downloader</a>, this blog already out there is starting to cover a lot of interesting material for me to start seeing what I can put together and take apart.<br></p><p>But for now a shout out to Adrian, and a pointer to yet another <b><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2004/12/18/325156.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2004/12/18/325156.html">blog I'll read</a></b>. :-)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><font color="#ff00ff"><i>The Unicode characters are taking the red-eye flight back to Seatte and therefore should be sponsoring blogs again soon!</i></font><br></p>

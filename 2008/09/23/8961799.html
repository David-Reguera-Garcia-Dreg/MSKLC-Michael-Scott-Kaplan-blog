<p>From that press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="1">Haumea sits among the trans-Neptunian objects, a vast ring of distant cold and rocky bodies in the outer Solar System. At this moment it is roughly 50 times the Sun-Earth distance from the Sun, but at its closest the elliptical orbit of Haumea brings it 35 times the Sun-Earth distance from our star.<br><br>Haumea is the name of the goddess of childbirth and fertility in Hawaiian mythology. The name is particularly apt as the goddess Haumea also represents the element of stone and observations of Haumea hint that, unusually, the dwarf planet is almost entirely composed of rock with a crust of pure ice.<br><br>Hawaiian mythology says that the goddess Haumea's children sprang from different parts of her body. The dwarf planet Haumea has a similar history, as it is joined in its orbit by two satellites that are thought to have been created by impacts with it in the past. During these impacts, parts of Haumea's icy surface were blasted off. The debris from these impacts is then thought to have gone onto form the two moons.<br><br>After their discovery, in 2005, the moons were also given provisional designations, but have now too been given names by the CSBN and the WGPSN. The first and largest moon is to be called <span class="rvts9">Hiʻiaka</span>, after the Hawaiian goddess who is said to have been born from the mouth of Haumea and the matron goddess of the island of <span class="rvts9">Hawaiʻi</span>. The second moon of Haumea is named Namaka, a water spirit who is said to have been born from Haumea's body.</font></p></blockquote>
<p>Now that is indeed quite cool, for reasons I am having trouble fully identifying.</p>
<p>I mean, language is everywhere.</p>
<p>And Unicode captures language.</p>
<p>So why be so interested when people get better and better at supporting language?</p>
<p>No idea. But I love it. :-)</p>

<p>The other day, reader Harmony7, in response to my blog <b><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/08/12/8849596.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/08/12/8849596.html">Unbloggableable: an inconceivableable term that makes me a little uncomfortableable</a></b>, <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/08/12/8849596.html#8938322" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/08/12/8849596.html#8938322">commented</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><i><font face="times new roman,times">This might be a bit off-topic, but I always thought the word "undoable" was confusing.<br><br>The dictionary says "undoable" means something unattainable: "An
undoable plan" might mean you don't have the necessary money or people.<br><br>However, especially in the world of computers and UI, it is often
used to mean something that can be undone: "An undoable edit control"
might be an edit control with an undo function.<br><br>Maybe things of these sorts kind of... evolve after a while.</font></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now I agree completely here, Harmony7 -- this was very off-topic.</p>
<p>But on the other hand it is an interesting new topic, which I will say something about now</p>
<p>This is the interesting difference between two separate etymological paths for the same word -- <b>undoable</b> as either <b>undo-able</b> or <b>un-doable</b>!</p>
<p>Now un-doable is the one Harmony7 is thinking about in the dictionary entry.</p>
<p>If one can <b>do</b> something, it is <b>doable</b>.</p>
<p>And if one cannot do something, then we add the "<b>un-</b>" prefix -- calling it <b>undoable</b> because by being not <b>doable</b>, it is <b>un-doable</b>.</p>
<p>Now the UI feature is thinking of the <b>undo</b> feature, one is thinking about the memory a computer program has of things you had the computer <b>do</b>. </p>
<p>Especially in terms of those item(s) on that list that one can <b>undo</b>. Because if you can <b>undo</b> them then they are <b>undoable</b>, because they are <b>undo-able</b>.</p>
<p>The fact that the same prefix and suffix are being used is unfortunate, as there are no methods or markers to know the difference between</p>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="5"><b>un((do)able)</b></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b><font size="5">((un)do)able</font></b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>which, since they both spell out the same word is troublesome.,</p>
<p>Oh well, at least someone had the awareness in capturing the case where an action a program may <b>do</b> that cannot allow the <b>undo</b> action is described as <b>can't undo</b> rather than unundoable! :-)</p>
<p>Because unundoable would be a doubleplusungood way to refer to things!</p>

<hr/><p><strong>Myria</strong> on 11 Sep 2008 11:08 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>I was at an HR management training session yesterday, and one of the slides had a bullet that said:</p>
<p>- Contract the expectations on your employees.</p>
<p>I had to ask the presenter whether she meant "CONtract" or "conTRACT", as they have different meanings: "CONtract" meaning "to make an agreement" or "conTRACT" meaning "to shorten".</p>
<p>I felt somewhat embarrassed asking this; she answered that it was CONtract, which seemed more likely anyway.</p></div>
<p><strong>harmony7</strong> on 12 Sep 2008 2:49 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Wow, I feel super grateful that you have written an entire blog post about that little comment I posted. &nbsp;One that was even &quot;very off-topic&quot;.</p>
<p>Maybe while I'm at it, I'll mention something else that's sort of off-topic but still is on the topic of something being -able: &nbsp;Available.</p>
<p>If something is available, what does that mean? &nbsp;If you think about it, we use the word available to mean what should really be described as &quot;availed&quot;. &nbsp;Available, then, should really mean that the item is in a state where it CAN be availed. &nbsp;Usually, though, we only care whether what we want is availed at that moment.</p>
<p>I'm not a native English speaker, so though over the years I have learned to live with them, they still do stand out to me.</p>
<p>(btw, I use a lowercase H in my handle name: harmony7.)</p></div>

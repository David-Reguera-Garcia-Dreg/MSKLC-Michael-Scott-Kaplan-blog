<h1>U+1d31d -- "She's So High" lyrics, as requested</h1>
<p><em>by Michael S. Kaplan, published on 2008/09/12 23:59 -04:00, original URI: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/michkap/archive/2008/09/12/8948899.aspx</em></p>

<p>It came about as a result of <b><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/09/11/8944147.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/09/11/8944147.html">The issue became moot as I decided to stand mute</a></b>, when I commented about the songs that I was thinking about singing:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tal_Bachman" mce_href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tal_Bachman">Tal Bachman</a>'s <b>She's 
So High</b> -- <i>the theme was going to be about a Unicode character with a 
lower number that feels unworthy of the romantic attention of a character with a 
higher code point value</i>;<br>
</li>

<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Len" mce_href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Len">Len</a>'s <b>Steal My Sunshine</b> 
-- with the help of a friend I met at a previous IUC who has a wonderful singing 
voice, the key tag line in the chorus "If you steal my sunshine" would have been 
replaced by "If you show my letters". </li>
</ul>

<p>but then decided not to do either after sizing up the competition and deciding I couldn't really top them. But then as I mentioned in <b><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/09/12/8945915.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/09/12/8945915.html">Getting a globe through the airport</a></b>, with <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/09/11/8944147.html#8944603" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/09/11/8944147.html#8944603">Phylyp</a> 
and <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/09/11/8944147.html#8944745" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/09/11/8944147.html#8944745">John</a> asking for some lyrics I figured I'd post at least one of them.</p>

<p>Now this is the one I was probably not going to do without help -- the Tal Bachman song. His vocal range is much better than mine.</p><p>You can look/hear it on YouTube <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVKcfwJxa54" mce_href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVKcfwJxa54">here</a>. His original lyrics:<br></p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="times new roman,times">She's blood, flesh and bone<br>No tucks or silicone<br>She's touch, smell, sight, taste and sound<br><br>But somehow I can't believe<br>That anything should happen<br>I know where I belong<br>And nothing's gonna happen<br><br>'Cause she's so high<br>High above me, she's so lovely<br>She's so high, like Cleopatra, Joan of Arc or Aphrodite<br>She's so high, high above me<br><br>First class and fancy free<br>She's high society<br>She's got the best of everything<br><br>What could a guy like me ever really offer?<br>She's perfect as she can be, why should I even bother?<br><br>'Cause she's so high<br>High above me, she's so lovely<br>She's so high, like Cleopatra, Joan of Arc or Aphrodite<br>She's so high, high above me<br><br>She calls to speak to me<br>I freeze immediately<br>'Cause what she says sounds so unreal<br><br>'Cause somehow I can't believe<br>That anything should happen<br>I know where I belong<br>And nothing's gonna happen<br><br>'Cause she's so high<br>High above me, she's so lovely<br>She's so high, like Cleopatra, Joan of Arc or Aphrodite<br>She's so high, high above me</font><br></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;Now the themes here are fascinating from a romance kind of standpoint.</p>

<p>In fact I suspect we've all been there before -- like when you have a crush on someone but you figure you don't stand a chance so you don't try. But then she suddenly approaches you and you are amazed and delighted though you know that in the end you may never get comfortable. Like the way Rob Gordon thought of Charlie Nicholson in <b>High Fidelity</b>.</p>

<p>Well I've been there at least. If you haven't then take my word for it -- <span style="font-weight: bold;">stressful</span>. :-)</p>

<p>Anyway, without further delay here are the lyrics I put together for the contest:</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><i>From v4.0, a sight to see<br>one -- dee -- three -- one -- dee<font size="1"><sup>1</sup></font><br>ess oh, zero, and oh enn</i><i><font size="1"><sup>2</sup></font></i><br><i><br>But somehow I can't believe<br>That she'd hang out with a G</i><i><font size="1"><sup>3</sup></font><br></i><i>I'm from the BASIC LATIN block<br>oh-oh-four-seven's in ASCII<br><br>And she's so high<br>High above me, 1d31d<br>She's so high, like DESERET, CUNEIFORM, or even KHAROSHTHI<br>She's so high, like in LINEAR B<br><br>Plane 1 and fancy free<br>She's supplementary<br>With attributes in the UCD<br><br>What could a char like G ever really offer?<br>I'm in code pages but she's not.

</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;There you have it. Play the video and you'll see what I meant about the voice range stuff -- Tal goes pretty high on some of it.</p>

<p>High above me, ironically enough! :-)<br></p>

<p>Anyway, the LEN song was more likely (I've even done it for geeks before, you my <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/10/28/486333.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/10/28/486333.html">recall</a>!), especially since it is easier to have someone do the high parts without as much planning ahead required. But between them I thought the above one was actually cooler and more fully formed.</p><p>There you have it....</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><font color="#ff00ff"><i>The identities of the sponsors of this post are left as an exercise for the reader</i></font><br></p>

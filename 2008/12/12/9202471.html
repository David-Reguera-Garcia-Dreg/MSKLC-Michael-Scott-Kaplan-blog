<p>Yesterday was an interesting day.</p>

<p>We had a morale event, an Argosy lunch cruise.</p>

<p>We managed to get the whole International Fundamentals team there, which was cool.:-)</p>

<p>My manager and others kept asking me if I could be there; a quick call to Argosy confirmed that they could handle a powered wheelchair.</p>

<p><i>Interestingly, they pointed out that the elevator was in the kitchen; they asked me I would have trouble with that. Are there people in wheelchairs who actually would? That is just downright odd!</i></p>

<p>Lunch was cool, and of course ther were the requisite number of people on the boat (crew and passengers) who came up to say they thought the iBOT was cool.</p>

<p>Am I a junky for the positive attention? I thought I'd be tired of it but I thibk the technical details of the iBOT appeal to me enough that I aall I can do is agree -- it is cool!</p>

<p>anyway, people kept offering to carpool, but I pointed out that since they don't have trucks it wouldn't work. I'd just take the 545 and head down to the waterfront....</p>

<p>And this is what I did -- straight down <a href="http://maps.live.com/#JndoZXJlMT1TcHJpbmcrU3QrJTI2KzR0aCtBdmUlMmMrU2VhdHRsZSUyYytXQSUyYys5ODEwNCZiYj00Ny42MTk5NjI5ODQzMTc4JTdlLTEyMi4zMDM1ODEyMzc3OTMlN2U0Ny41OTM2MzI5MDA1NTQ4JTdlLTEyMi4zNjM1MzM5NzM2OTQ=" mce_href="http://maps.live.com/#JndoZXJlMT1TcHJpbmcrU3QrJTI2KzR0aCtBdmUlMmMrU2VhdHRsZSUyYytXQSUyYys5ODEwNCZiYj00Ny42MTk5NjI5ODQzMTc4JTdlLTEyMi4zMDM1ODEyMzc3OTMlN2U0Ny41OTM2MzI5MDA1NTQ4JTdlLTEyMi4zNjM1MzM5NzM2OTQ=">Spring</a> in 4-wheel mode, into balance once I hit <a href="http://maps.live.com/#JnE9eXAuU3ByaW5nK1N0KyUyNitBbGFza2FuK1dheSUyYytTZWF0dGxlJTJjK1dBJTJjKzk4MTA0JTdlc3N0LjAlN2VwZy4xJmJiPTY4LjE3MTU1NTE4NzMyNSU3ZS01Ny4yMTY3OTY4NzUlN2UxNC4xNzkxODYxNDIzNTQyJTdlMTgw" mce_href="http://maps.live.com/#JnE9eXAuU3ByaW5nK1N0KyUyNitBbGFza2FuK1dheSUyYytTZWF0dGxlJTJjK1dBJTJjKzk4MTA0JTdlc3N0LjAlN2VwZy4xJmJiPTY4LjE3MTU1NTE4NzMyNSU3ZS01Ny4yMTY3OTY4NzUlN2UxNC4xNzkxODYxNDIzNTQyJTdlMTgw">Alaskan</a>, and onto the boat shortly thereafter.</p>

<p>I could have taken a different route down than Spring (some people balk at the steep hill and prefer other ways down to the water that involve stairs), but I have determined something about stairs and the iBOT.</p>

<p>Don't get me wrong, It is an incredibly useful feature, a lifesaver from situations that would otherwise be blocking</p>

<p>But most of the time, if you do it, then you're just showing off....</p>

<p>And I am not above showing off (that is why I spend so much time in balance mode!), but sowing off in balance mode is actually more comfortable and less work involved. Climbing stairs is more work!</p>

<p>So I took <a href="http://maps.live.com/#JndoZXJlMT1TcHJpbmcrU3QrJTI2KzR0aCtBdmUlMmMrU2VhdHRsZSUyYytXQSUyYys5ODEwNCZiYj00Ny42MTk5NjI5ODQzMTc4JTdlLTEyMi4zMDM1ODEyMzc3OTMlN2U0Ny41OTM2MzI5MDA1NTQ4JTdlLTEyMi4zNjM1MzM5NzM2OTQ=" mce_href="http://maps.live.com/#JndoZXJlMT1TcHJpbmcrU3QrJTI2KzR0aCtBdmUlMmMrU2VhdHRsZSUyYytXQSUyYys5ODEwNCZiYj00Ny42MTk5NjI5ODQzMTc4JTdlLTEyMi4zMDM1ODEyMzc3OTMlN2U0Ny41OTM2MzI5MDA1NTQ4JTdlLTEyMi4zNjM1MzM5NzM2OTQ=">Spring</a>, and I took  the elevator once I was onboard.</p>

<p>Lunch was cool, and I headed out with everyone after, until we parted ways so people could head back to work and pack (yes, we're finally doing <b><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/10/08/5351763.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/10/08/5351763.html">the gratuitous move</a></b> -- more on that another time!).</p>

<p>So I headed out, in balance mode, up to the base of <a href="http://maps.live.com/#JnE9eXAuU3ByaW5nK1N0KyUyNitBbGFza2FuK1dheSUyYytTZWF0dGxlJTJjK1dBJTJjKzk4MTA0JTdlc3N0LjAlN2VwZy4xJmJiPTY4LjE3MTU1NTE4NzMyNSU3ZS01Ny4yMTY3OTY4NzUlN2UxNC4xNzkxODYxNDIzNTQyJTdlMTgw" mce_href="http://maps.live.com/#JnE9eXAuU3ByaW5nK1N0KyUyNitBbGFza2FuK1dheSUyYytTZWF0dGxlJTJjK1dBJTJjKzk4MTA0JTdlc3N0LjAlN2VwZy4xJmJiPTY4LjE3MTU1NTE4NzMyNSU3ZS01Ny4yMTY3OTY4NzUlN2UxNC4xNzkxODYxNDIzNTQyJTdlMTgw">Spring Street and Alaskan Way</a>, when I suddenly remembered something I had recently learned.</p>

<p>The directions for the iBOT suggest that you should not do more than a 10° incline in Balance mode (20° in 4-wheel), but they aren't really all that accurate -- it can take a much bigger incline -- even in training I was taken on steeper ones.</p>

<p>The key is that the hill has to be straught ahead, because the iBOT does not have lateral iBALANCE, only forward/backward iBALANCE.</p>

<p>So I decided to test that theory by going up Spring Street all the way to 4th Avenue, in Balance mode.</p>

<p>You want to know something?</p>

<p>I am pissed.</p>

<p>I could have taken somebody with me, someione with a camera. Someone to capture me going up a street with a 30° to 40° incline, with me flat and level all the way up, going at the same speed as if I were on level ground.</p>

<p>It was awesome!</p>

<p>I tried to get my head around how odd/interesting it must have looked, but I'm going to have to get it captured on film -- not just pictures but live motion video.</p>

<p>I don't have access to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steadicam" mce_href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steadicam">Steadicam</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font face="times new roman,times"><i>A steadicam is a stabilizing mount for a motion picture camera, which mechanically isolates the operator's movement from the camera, allowing a very smooth shot even when the operator is moving quickly over an uneven surface.</i></font>&nbsp; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>But even so, a little amateur footage might be just the thing here, though I imagine there are logistical problems with walking up that hill at the same speed. We'll have to do some figuring out here, certainly. Both up and down, since being at a a 50°-60° angle is just as cool as being at a 120°-130° angle....</p>

<p>I guess it is too much to ask if anyone in the Seattle area has a Steadicam and a few hours? :-)</p>

Ten? Twenty-three?</p><p>I can't recall.</p><p>The meal was over, I forget what we ate. <br></p><p>Because as soon as the doors closed, we turned to each other, and kissed.</p>This kiss, with me in balance mode and her standing next to me?<p>It was hot.</p><p>No worries about falling, no need to keep my eyes open to compensate for loss of proprioception, no requirement to be anywhere else other than right there, kissing.</p><p>Now you may recall all that I said about <b><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/02/04/7422519.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/02/04/7422519.html">ideal kissing height when standing</a></b> (a blog that is currently <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;fkt=931&amp;fsdt=7400&amp;q=ideal+kissing+height" mce_href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;fkt=931&amp;fsdt=7400&amp;q=ideal+kissing+height">#1 in a Google search on ideal kissing height</a>, by the way!).</p><p>In a singular moment, where we happened to be the same height due to my careful adjustments, with the help of the iBOT and the iBALANCE technology, we were the ideal kissing height.</p><p>And right then, we were in the ideal kiss.</p><p>Did I mention it was hot? <br></p><p>Well, until the next time we do it, I mean.

<p>Though I have to thank both of you for helping confirm that is wasn't either one of you. Maybe that'll keep the folks in study hall from whispering about it too much!</p>

<p><i><font color="#ff0000">Computerized apologies to Soundgarden, an awesome band that at a minimum deserves more intelligent puns....</font></i><br></p><p>Someone was having trouble getting something to work in Vista (yes, yes, alert the news media). The problem description:</p><blockquote><p><i><font face="times new roman,times">Hi, there, sorry for spam. I want to use weather service gadget on my Vista sidebar, but it shows “Services not available”.... Do I have to set up any configuration like firewall, proxy? Thanks.</font></i></p></blockquote><p>Several others chimed in with a helpful "works for me!". Scroan.<br></p><p>Then thankfully someone else inquired about the language settings. We'll get back to that in a second.<br></p><p>Someone else then pointed out KB article 931272 (<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;931272" mce_href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;931272">Message that you may receive when you try to view the Weather gadget on the Windows Sidebar in Windows Vista: “Service not available in your language or region”</a>).</p><p>I hate that article, by the way. </p><p>The resolution steps it gives:</p><blockquote><p><font face="times new roman,times">To resolve this issue follow these steps.<br><br><b>Note</b> These steps resolve

The terrible description is just the cherry on top of the inedible sundae....<br></p><p>It is yet another instance of the <b><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/12/13/6689013.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/12/13/6689013.html">If you play with your gadget, there are all kinds of problems you can run into</a></b> problem.</p><p>Scary.</p><p>Anyway, the person having the trouble admitted to having Simplified Chinese/China settings, at which point someone else pointed out a fascinating reference.</p><p>And when I say fascinating I mean the way traffic accidents or train crashes or fascinating....</p><p>The pointer was to <a href="http://www.china.org.cn/environment/2007-08/27/content_1034467.htm" mce_href="http://www.china.org.cn/environment/2007-08/27/content_1034467.htm">Meteorology Law of the People's Republic of China</a>, specifically Article 22 and Article 25 in that document:<font face="times new roman,times"><br></font></p><blockquote><p><font face="times new roman,times"><b>Article 22 </b>The State applies a unified system for the issue of public meteorological forecast and severe weather warning. Meteorological offices and stations subordinate to the competent meteorological departments at different levels shall, in compliance with their functions and duties, issue to the community public meteorological forecast and severe weather warning, with timely supplements or corrections added as the weather changes. No other organizations or individuals may issue to the community such forecast or warning. Meteorological offices and stations subordinate to other relevant departments under the State Council or under the people's governments of provinces, autonomous regions or municipalities directly under the Central Government may issue specialized meteorological forecast to be used within the frame work of their departments. The competent meteorological departments at different levels and the meteorological offices and stations subordinate to them shall issue public meteorological forecast and severe weather warning with improved accuracy, timeliness and service.<br><br>...<br><br><b>Article 25 </b>When the media, including radio, television, newspaper and telecommunication, issue to the community public meteorological forecast or severe weather warning, they shall use the latest meteorological information provided by a meteorological office or station subordinate to a competent meteorological department, while indicating the time of issue and the name of the office or station. Part of the revenues from the distribution of meteorological information shall be drawn to support the development of meteorological service.</font><br></p></blockquote><p>Some of the other articles are also fascinating. But if it were up to me I'm not sure I would want to be required to use one service and required to pay their (not subject to competition) rates. </p><p>I have no idea if that is why the service is not available in China, but I've heard of stranger things. Both from in China and from other countries.</p><p>What was Shakespeare said about the Law? :-) </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><font color="#ff00ff"><i>This blog brlought to you by</i><font size="7"> ☀ </font><i>(<a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2600" mce_href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2600">U+2600</a>, aka BLACK SUN WITH RAYS)</i></font><br></p>

In that case, I don't see what their user locale has to do with their location. I presumed it's their locale since location doesn't seem to have a language component.</p></div>

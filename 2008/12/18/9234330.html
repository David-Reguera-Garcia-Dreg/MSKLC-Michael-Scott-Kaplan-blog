<h1>Whither ICU.NET? I don't see it thither...</h1>

<p>In the past 10 days I have had four people ask me the same question. Here is one if the most recent ones:</p><blockquote><p><i><font face="times new roman,times">Hi Michael,<br><br>One of my friends was asking if there is an ICU for .NET. icu4c-4_0-Win32-msvc8.zip that he got from http://www.icu-project.org/download/4.0.html seems to be the one for Native Win32.<br><br>Thanks</font></i></p></blockquote><p>Hmmm. I can honestly say that I have no idea whatsoever. :-)</p><p>But the whole inquiry scores pretty well on my "scale of 1 to interesting" metric so I think I'll talk about it for a minute. Not as an ICU expert (which I am not), but as an eager and interested external observer who is insanely curious about some of the weirdest things....<br></p><p>As far as I know there are only version for C (ICU4C) and for Java (ICU4J).</p><p>Now I do know that many features in ICU4J depend on features and functionality in Java itself, which tells me that ICU4J is not a straight port of ICU4C -- it is an extension to Java to provide the full features of ICU (you must have a minimum version of Java to get full ICU support, for example).<br></p><p>This suggests that someone <b>could</b> choose to build an ICU.NET that took all of the built in features from the appropriate namespaces like <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.globalization.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.globalization.aspx">System.Globalization</a> and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.text.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.text.aspx">System.Text</a>, and then extended them to add in the other features ICU boasts like the UCA, transliteration, and fuller Unicode Character Database support.</p><p>Though I can't imagine Microsoft doing such a project, it does sound like parts of it would be pretty exciting. If I were still a consultant and some client with deep pockets wanted such a deliverable I imagine I'd really push to be one of the deliverers of the deliverable.</p><p>But back in the real world, I don't have that kind of time. :-)<br></p><p>I don't know of anyone else working on such a thing either. If anyone does and it isn't a secret they could probably chime in and add a comment or two here. I think it does sound like an interesting idea, and technically speaking it would be a fascinating cross-platform extension of ICU itself (not to mention of .NET which does have other platforms of its own from the Mac to mobile devices and so on).</p><p>Anyone out there working on ICU.NET?</p><p><br></p><p><font color="#ff00ff"><i>This blog brought to you by</i><font size="6"> ? </font><i>(<a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/003f" mce_href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/003f">U+003f</a>, aka QUESTION MARK)</i></font> <br></p>

<p><a id="9237103" href="#9237103">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 18 Dec 2008 2:44 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>I can't imagine people wanting to have two huge runtimes like Java *and* .NET being loaded up by their applications, though. Yuck!</p>
</div>
<p><a id="9245903" href="#9245903">#</a> <strong>Stephen A.</strong> on 21 Dec 2008 5:44 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>I'm pretty sure IKVM.Net does not load on the Java runtime. Indeed, according to its front page, IKVM is:</p>
<p>* A Java Virtual Machine implemented in .NET</p>
<p>* A .NET implementation of the Java class libraries</p>
<p>* Tools that enable Java and .NET interoperability</p>
<p>So only one runtime plus a set of support libraries (bad, but not *too* bad).</p></div>
<p><a id="9246126" href="#9246126">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 21 Dec 2008 9:44 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Hmmm... but as a base to another library (ICU)? I wonder what kind of overhead that would add....</p>
</div>
<p><a id="9246286" href="#9246286">#</a> <strong>Kiran Chand Palakkattiri</strong> on 22 Dec 2008 12:14 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Hmmm... Good. It will be really good if somebody brings an ICU Defn for .NET</p>
<p>Michael, what do you think about writing wrapper in .NET for ICU for win32?</p>
<p>I hope, we could use it like native code, or as a COM/ActiveX object. What say?</p></div>
<p><a id="9246328" href="#9246328">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 22 Dec 2008 12:44 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>What do I think about doing the actual work? I can't because of where I work.</p>
<p>But if someone else wants to do such a thing I'd root for them and be supportive and if they had questions I'd try to be helpful and answer them.... :-)</p>

<p>this has actually already been done. Check out:</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://code.google.com/p/icu-dotnet/">http://code.google.com/p/icu-dotnet/</a></p>
<p>Gotta compile it yourself, but we use it for a number of our language software projects.</p></div>

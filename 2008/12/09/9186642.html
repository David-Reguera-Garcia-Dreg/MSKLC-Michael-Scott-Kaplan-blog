<p>In response to yesterday's blog (<b><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/12/08/9183424.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/12/08/9183424.html">The "plate of shrimp" theory explains it</a></b>), a depressing number of people admitted via the Contact link that they did not understand the reference....</p><p><i>In this case, n&gt;0 would be depressing, but it was actually more than that (thus the depressing part)</i></p><p>Anyway, for the benefit of those who didn't get it, I'll explain here. </p><p>It comes from the 1984 film <b>Repo Man</b>:</p><blockquote><p><font face="times new roman,times">Lots of people don't realize what's really going on. They view life as a bunch of unconnected incidents and things.<br><br>They don't realize that there's this lattice of coincidence on top of everything.<br><br>I'll give you an example to show you what I mean:<br><br>Suppose you're thinking about a plate of shrimp.<br><br>Suddenly, somebody says: plate, or shrimp, or plate of shrimp.<br><br>No point in looking for an explanation. It's all part of a cosmic unconsciousness.</font></p></blockquote><p>Like there is no reason for the two (or more) related things to happen at the same time. But they do....</p><p>Don't you notice that, too?</p><p>Maybe if Virginia had left a plate of shrimp for Santa she wouldn't have needed to both the New York Sun with her Santa Claus questions. Perhaps Santa was thinking aout shrimp anyway! :-)<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><font color="#ff00ff"><i>This blog brlought to you by</i><font size="6"> â—‰ </font><i>(<a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/25c9" mce_href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/25c9">U+25c9</a>, aka FISHEYE)</i></font> <br></p>

<p>Spooky!</p></div>

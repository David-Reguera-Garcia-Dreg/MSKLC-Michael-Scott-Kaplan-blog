</ul>

<p>Now when you only have a certain amount of space in a control and you have to truncate the text inside it, one common thing for developers to do is look at the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.globalization.stringinfo.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.globalization.stringinfo.aspx">StringInfo class</a> that I have talked about <b><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/04/29/413366.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/04/29/413366.html">before</a></b> and avoid the truncation of text on character boundaries.</p>
<p>If you need to do it in native rather than managed code, having to do all the work yourself may even seem a little daunting, but once aimed at the way to solve the perceived problem, you may be off aned running. <br></p>
<p>You know, make it <b>a simple UCS-2 vs. UTF-16 issue like the ones we have done before</b>. </p>
<p>To be honest, this is usually the wrong approach.</p>
<p>It is a great approach oif what one is worried about is <b>size of storage</b>, like a SQL Server column whose size cannot be exceeded.</p>
<p>But not so good if one is dealing with a rendering issue -- with truncation of the display of text in a user interface.</p>
<p>Lest we forget, the width of the widest character and the skinniest one really shows the heart of the problem. Just think about what UI will do with</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b><font size="5">WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW</font></b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>vs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="5">iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In both cases we are seeing 20 characters, but clearly one string is gonna take up a whole lot more space than the other.</p>
<p>Using the <b>character</b> boundary, even the <b><i>linguistic</i></b> character boundary, is not the most sensible way to tackle the problem.</p>
<p>A good way to turn in these rendering scenarios is toward rendering solutions, since they have two things over everyone else -- not only do they have the ACTUAL width of the text to work with, but they also pack some of the linguistic data about character boundaries right in them! </p><p>The simplest solution might be to go the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms533909.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms533909.aspx">DrawText</a> direction for rendering -- with the special flag</p><ul><li>DT_MODIFYSTRING</li></ul><p>combined with one of the magical truncation-friendly flags:</p><ul><li>DT_END_ELLIPSIS -- <i>For displayed text, if the end of a string does not fit in the rectangle, it is truncated and ellipses are added. If a word that is not at the end of the string goes beyond the limits of the rectangle, it is truncated without ellipses.</i><br></li><li>DT_PATH_ELLIPSIS -- <i>For displayed text, replaces characters in the middle of the string with ellipses so that the result fits in the specified rectangle. If the string contains backslash (\) characters, DT_PATH_ELLIPSIS preserves as much as possible of the text after the last.</i><br></li><li>DT_WORD_ELLIPSIS -- <i>Truncates any word that does not fit in the rectangle and adds ellipses.</i> <br></li></ul><p>What the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms533909.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms533909.aspx">DrawText</a> documentation does not mention in there is that most of the problems we talked about before -- from surrogate pairs to combining characters to what happens when complex scripts are rendered and so on -- are all built-in there. So most of the work will be done for us!</p><p>Finally, a situation where the native code has more to say for itself than the managed code, since there isn't really a DrawText.NET analogue.</p><p>Though perhaps you are already imagining how one would handle the specific scenario you need based on the three flags if you had to write it yourself -- and whether you are daunted by the complexity or delighted by it, the problem, along with the complexities of combining characters and surrogate pairs, is at least a tractable one....</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><font color="#ff00ff"><i>This blog brought to you by</i><font size="6"> Ü¢&nbsp; </font><i>(<a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0722" mce_href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0722">U+0722</a>, aka SYRIAC LETTER NUN)</i></font><br></p>

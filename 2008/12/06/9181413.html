<h1>Sorting "Collate" all out</h1>

<p>It was recently suggested to me that the terms <b>COLLATION</b> and <b>COLLATE</b> are confusing to people.</p><p>Not people over here, I'd guess.</p><p>And probably not so much the people who work in SQL Server or Access or really any database program -- anyone who places so much stock in keywords like <b>ORDER BY</b> is definitely in a class of their own, conceptually.<br></p><p>But it is a somewhat obvious fact that the set of people who can be considered <b>PEOPLE</b> is a superset of both the set of people who <b>HAVE EVEN HEARD OF THIS BLOG</b> and the set of people who have <b>THE VAGUEST NOTION OF DATABASES</b>.</p><p>Thus my supposition of the latter two sets not being confused is hardly evidence against the claim that the terms <b>COLLATION</b> and <b>COLLATE</b> are confusing to people.</p><p>They might be right.</p><p>I think that <b>COLLATION</b> and <b>COLLATE</b> are the kind of words most people have a vague notion about, a vague notion that may not translate into an understanding when it shows up in blogs or web sites or white papers or documentation.</p><p>And to make it worse I think that they are the kind of words that people think they should understand, which will lead them to not ask the obvious question of "<b>WHAT DOES THAT WORD MEAN?</b>" in any place that people can identify them as someone who did not know.</p><p>That passive "shame" (for lack of a better word) is a powerful force. </p><p>It is behind the fact that my <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/tshirts/science/6dff/">Schrödinger's Cat is 
Dead</a> T-shirt does so well at starting conversations with girls whether they understand the reference or not but tends to repel guys (ref: <b><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/07/04/655821.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/07/04/655821.html">here</a></b>).The shame of not knowing something that you have a vague sense that you ought to know? You could provide power for a small New Jersey town if you could somehow harness the energy of that....</p><p>Okay, so <b>COLLATION</b> is confusing.</p><p>But if you you use it a bunch of places (the aforementioned blogs or web sites or white papers or documentation) then what are your alternatives?</p><p>There is of course <b>SORTING</b>, a term I obviously can't dislike too much since it is the biggest word I use in the title of this Blog.</p><p>But to tell you the truth I don't really care much for that term, since although it is one common way to make use out of parts the collation API functions:</p><ul><li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms647476.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms647476.aspx">CompareString</a></li><li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms647477.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms647477.aspx">CompareStringEx</a></li><li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cc448052.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cc448052.aspx">LCMapString</a></li><li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms776387.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms776387.aspx">LCMapStringEx</a></li><li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms776359.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms776359.aspx">FindNLSString</a></li><li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms776360.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms776360.aspx">FindNLSStringEx</a></li><li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms776340.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms776340.aspx">CompareStringOrdinal</a></li><li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms776253.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms776253.aspx">IsNLSDefinedString</a></li><li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms776287.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms776287.aspx">GetNLSVersion</a></li><li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms776366.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms776366.aspx">GetNLSVersionEx</a><br></li></ul><p>and so on, <b>NONE OF THEM ACTUALLY SORT ANYTHING</b>. At best they either provide a means to sort if you have a sorting algorithm (eg <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms647476.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms647476.aspx">CompareString</a>) or they do related ancillary activities that use the same data (eg <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms776359.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms776359.aspx">FindNLSString</a>).</p><p>Since none of them perform the action in question, one almost does want a word that, like the operations themselves, is one stepped removed from what the functions do and instead frames the concept.</p><p>One that matches what Unicode does (e.g. the Unicode Collation Algorithm, which some more people may have heard of).<br></p><p>So this potentially makes <b>COLLATION</b> a great word here, except for the fact that it is the wrong word here.</p><p>Now Microsoft as a company is not above just shoving the word down people's throats because they feel like it (it true <b>screw the customer</b> fashion), thus we insert things like <b>ORDINAL</b> into the mix because between the two kinds of confusion:</p><ul><li><b>WTF</b> confusion, i.e. What the hell are you talking about? confusion, and</li><li><b>I THINK I KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS BUT NOT REALLY OR I'M ACTUALLY WRONG</b> confusion</li></ul><p>on the whole they prefer the former and not the latter. <b>ORDINAL</b> fits that model and is a true <b>WTF</b> term here, but <b>COLLATION</b> does not, at least not for the average person, the average member of the set of all people who are people.</p><p>And <b>SORTING</b> doesn't fit since sorting is a specific act that makes it way in to methods and functions and nine of the methods or functions do it or use the word.</p><p>The model of <b>SORTING (ALL ASSEMBLY REQUIRED)</b> for something that everybody intuitively understands -- since everybody understand both the <b>WHICH COMES FIRST?</b> question and the <b>ARE THEY THE SAME?</b> question&nbsp; -- but no function actually sorts.</p><p>And then that last point -- the <b>WHICH COMES FIRST?</b> question and the <b>ARE THEY THE SAME?</b> question, suggests the other problem -- that <b>SORTING</b>, while clearly part of the former question is not so much part of the latter one.</p><p>Alright, so neither word is really the right way to go. So what is?</p><p>Well, the answer is kind of built in to the excessively long explanation of the non-answers, isn't it?</p><p>I mean, if one desires a term that<br></p><ul><li>everyone understands</li><li>everyone's understanding tends to be correct more often than not</li><li>is part of the set of functions/methods that do the work</li></ul><p>then does one have to look any further than <b>COMPARE</b> and <b>COMPARISON</b>?</p><p>In the words of fictional former president Bartlett, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvGmL4aG4L4" mce_href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvGmL4aG4L4">What's next?</a>¹<br><br><br><font size="1">1 - The line is: "When I ask 'What's Next?' it means I'm ready to move on to other things.

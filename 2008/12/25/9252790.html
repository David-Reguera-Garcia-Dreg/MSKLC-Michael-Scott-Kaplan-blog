<p>A couple of days ago, I went out with the iBOT into the still uncleared snowed-over sidewalks.</p><p>It was a test -- I had some Christmas day plans (a bunch of Seattle orphans sans travel plans all heading to Amy's places the top of Capitol Hill for Jumbalaya and wine and conversation) amd I wanted to make sure the iBOT would be able to navigate through the snow successfully.</p><p>You know I can count on one hand the number of white Christmas years I've seen in Seattle since O first git here in '96 on one hand and have as heap of fingers left over, so this is all quite weird.</p><p>Anyway, the test was a success -- I was able to move around and up an down the street with minimal difficulty.</p><p>I let Amy know I'd make it and I even practiced on the stairs at my place so I'd feel comfortable with the whole "strange stairs/weird handrails" type cases that might confront me once I got there.</p><p>I was ready.</p><p>We heard about some rain being forecast, which is the usual way that the snow goes away. <br></p><p>The old question I recalled "when did Noah build the ark?" and its answer "<i>Before</i> the rain, before the rain" were in my mind, and I figured with rain coming then things might not even have needed me to do the extra practice.</p><p>No worries, I still felt ready.</p><p>And then the rain came.</p><p>After that came a bit more snow.</p><p>The end result was a slushy, crappy mess.</p><p>Heading out at 2pm for a 2:35 bus that usually took just a few minutes to get to, I felt like I left adequate time to get to the bus stop.</p><p>I made it out of the Cambrian with minimal effort, but once I hit the street (well, the sidewalk next to 40th), I was in a world of hurt.</p><p>I was stuck within ten feet.</p><p>It took me 16 minutes of moving back and forth, turning, and mode changing (up into balasnce and then jumping down to 4-wheel proved to be particularly useful at moving out of a slightkly stuck position!) to get turned around and back into the Cambrian.</p><p>I called Amy to let her know I was going to miss the Jumbalaya. She shared with me that I was not the only one bailing -- several others were worried about the trip to the top of Capitol Hill too. She might endcup with the lion's share of the food.</p><p>It also means canceled plans last night and today and probably tomorrow and maybe the day after that and... <br></p><p>It kind of sucked realizing that I was basically trapped in my apartment for the time being. </p><p>I have food and I have power and I have heat and I have Internet connectivity, so being stuck here is not such a bad thing.</p><p>But the realization that I was stuck here for who knows how long is a depressing one.</p><p>Of course I know that the scooter wouldn't have even made it out of the Cambrian -- so the iBOT has opened many doors here. But short of getting chains or studded snow tires on it, the iBOT is not going to get me through <i>every</i> door. Certainly no the door to the top of Capitol Hill....</p><p>Maybe I should look into tire chains for the iBOT tires? You know, for just in case? :-)</p><p>If you were expecting me to pop by the office tomorrow then consider this your notice that it ain't gonna happen. We'll try again next week, maybe. <br></p><p><br></p><p><font face="Tahoma"><font color="#ff00ff"><i>This post brought to you by</i><font size="7"> </font><font size="7">â™¿ </font></font><i><font color="#ff00ff">(</font><a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/267f" class="" mce_href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/267f">U+267f</a><font color="#ff00ff">, a.k.a.

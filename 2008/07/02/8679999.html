<P>So reader Jeroen Ruigrok van der Werven's question (by email and suggestion box) was:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times">Michael,<BR><BR>sorry for the potential duplicate (had sent it to your trigeminal account 2 weeks ago)<BR><BR>What would be a/the reason the candidate list presented by the Japanese IME 2007 to be almost empty when using it in Notepad?<BR><BR>When I write, for example, ほかけへん most (if not all) of my applications will allow me to create 他け変. In Notepad, however, I get these options only:<BR><BR>歩か/ほか/ホカ け/ケ へん/ヘン<BR><BR>A bit strange that only Notepad suffers from this.<BR><BR>It's Windows x64 by the way.<BR><BR>Any ideas?</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>No worries on the duplication, that is nowhere the record!</P>
<P>In fact....</P>
<P><EM>The record was an MSLU&nbsp;question that over the course of a few days made it to me via&nbsp;</EM></P>
<UL>
<LI><EM>two different&nbsp;Trigeminal email accounts, </EM></LI>
<LI><EM>an internal Microsoft distribution list via someone in PSS</EM></LI>
<LI><EM>a newsgroup posting&nbsp;to the MSLU newsgroup</EM></LI>
<LI><EM>an email from someone in Premier support who was told I was the MSLU guy</EM></LI></UL>
<P>I asked the two PSS folks to nicely ask the person to try to use just one of those methods since they all made it to me eventually. :-)</P>
<P>Anyway, back to the question at hand....</P>
<P>I happen to have a Vista SP1 machine with Office 2007 installed -- it is that good old Mac Book Pro of mine (I only run in 64-bit mode these days; the 32-bit OS space has been re purposed so I can do some actual work on the machine!), so I felt well-equipped to try out this question.</P>
<P>First, I'll give people who want to try this out on their own the keystrokes to get that</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=5>ほかけへん</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>that is the input string we are working with, basically</P>

<P>I got it by typing (on my US style keyboard):</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=6>-t'=y</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Okay, so now let's play....</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/jpn01.png"></P>
<P>Okay, let's hit the space bar and see what we get:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/jpn02.png"></P>
<P>Hmm, an interesting start. My results are already different.</P>
<P>Let's hit the spacebar again to look at the candidate list:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/jpn03.png"></P>
<P>Okay, some familiar, some not.</P>
<P>Let's try changing the conversion mode from the <STRONG><U>G</U>eneral</STRONG> to the <STRONG>Bias for <U>N</U>ames</STRONG> choice:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/jpn04.png"></P>
<P>We'll hit that spacebar again:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/jpn05.png"></P>
<P>Hmmm... already different still! Let's look at the candidate list by hitting the spacebar again:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/jpn06.png"></P>
<P>Different again! Maybe the <STRONG>Bias for <U>S</U>peech</STRONG> </P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/jpn07.png"></P>
<P>has something interesting too? Let's hit the spacebar again and see:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/jpn08.png"></P>
<P>Hmmm. Let's see the candidate list:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/jpn09.png"></P>
<P>Okay, clearly we have lots of choices.</P>
<P>Let's pay more attention to where in the candidate string we are, since the candidate list is just about the "bold underlined" bit, e.g. the third character in this case:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/jpn10.png"></P>
<P>Interesting. and doesn't that character look familiar?</P>
<P>What do some of the other candidates look like for some of the other characters?</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/jpn12.png"></P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/jpn13.png"></P>
<P>Anyway, enough torture. :-)</P>
<P>In the end, I got the string in question:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/jpn14.png"></P>
<P>So technically I was unable to reproduce the issue reported.</P>
<P>But let's be honest -- I have no idea if we were using the same version of Windows or the same IME or anything.</P>
<P>Obviously there are interesting linguistic issue in with those candidate bias settings, probably a good topic for another day?</P>
<P>So to talk about the specific question about the possible differences between applications, that has a lot to do with how much support they build in for the IME, and how much the IME itself can discern about the application, as well.</P>
<P>Offhand, I would guess that the applications are making modifications to the candidate settings based on what is being typed, maybe?</P>
<P>Though in the end, I would need to be able to reproduce the problem of the inability to get 他け変 in order to say for sure why 他け変 was unavailable....</P>

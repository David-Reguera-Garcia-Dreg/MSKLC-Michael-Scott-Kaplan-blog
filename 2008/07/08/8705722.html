<P>Usually when I am on Vista, I install a bunch of MUI Language Packs and LIPs (Language Interface Packs).</P>
<P>Habit, I guess.</P>
<P>Sometimes I even install beta builds of them.</P>
<P>I just like that big list of user interface language choices!</P>
<P>Then occasionally when it turns out I need back some of that 25gb of space, which makes me wonder why I feel this compulsive thing about installing them in the first place....</P>
<P>Of course you can't uninstall everything on the list. For example:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/remove01.png"></P>
<P>English is my system default UI language -- so it won't let me remove that. This makes sense to me.</P>
<P>On the other hand, when I made Vietnamese the default UI language for me:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/remove04.png"></P>
<P>No warning in this case. Bummer.</P>
<P>Oh well, it asks you to reboot after removing an item from the list, so I guess it's no big deal that it will let you reboot something that is your language choice.</P>
<P>It looks like the Vietnamese language pack is missing a lot of strings anyway....</P>
<P>I'm going to avoid the uninstall of the current user interface language; I'm not enough of a tester to want to work so hard to see what I can break.</P>
<P>I'm curious whether the uninstall will fail or problems will come up after the reboot, but let's face it not enough to try it. :-)</P>
<P>Now there is another time you will see that warning icon. I saw it two more times, in fact. One for Russian:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/remove02.png"></P>
<P>and one for Spanish:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/remove03.png"></P>
<P>Though I must admit the text doesn't do as good of a job telling me why:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000 size=4>The language can't be selected because it is being used by another language file on this computer.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Huh?</P>
<P>What the @#%&amp;*!&nbsp;does "language file" mean here?</P>
<P>To be honest it is times like this that I feel sorry for two distinct groups of people:</P>
<UL>
<LI>our users, who have to put up with the fact that we do not provide an English localization so that they won't be subjected to this bizarre dialect of&nbsp;English that we sometimes speak, and</LI>
<LI>our localizers, who are asked to (through the process of localization) translate the meaning and intent of software that (let's face it) could use some occasional real shoring up on meaning!</LI></UL>
<P>Well luckily if you know Perl you can use the line in the title to help the string make a little more sense.</P>
<P>And now I am being accurate but not entirely helpful, too. Think of it as part three of a three-phase authentication of my being an employee of Microsoft. :-)</P>
<P>Additional Hint: Tatar,&nbsp;Galician.</P>

<p>Err... wow... speachless here!!!</p>
<p>Not only it uses a contraction (can't instead of cannot) -- it uses passive voice TWICE in the same sentence.</p>
<p>Is it possible that someone working at Microsoft doesn't know about spelling &amp; grammar option in Word?</p></div>

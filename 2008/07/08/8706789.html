<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><EM><FONT face="times new roman,times">Surely the font installer does not need to know who exactly may or may not be using the font; it just broadcasts the WM_FONTCHANGE message and well-behaved applications will handle it and update their font information accordingly.</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P mce_keep="true">Now Andrew is quite right -- <A class="" href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms533930.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms533930.aspx">WM_FONTCHANGE</A> is just the message that a responsible&nbsp;installer/uninstaller would send here.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">Unfortunately there are many problems with the architecture -- some the fault of installers/uninstallers that are indirectly the fault of the difficulty of the task, and others the fault of the complex process that nevertheless has failed to keep up with some of the complexities of the underlying platform:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<DIV mce_keep="true">Lots of installers out there tend to be about as responsible as Nathan Scott's mom when she's bombed;</DIV></LI>
<LI>
<DIV mce_keep="true">Even more uninstallers out there tend to be worse;</DIV></LI>
<LI>
<DIV mce_keep="true">Since install and uninstall have detectable consequences, forcing this extra step is a little unfair;</DIV></LI>
<LI>
<DIV mce_keep="true">Starting in Vista, the work to mitigate shatter attacks keeps a process from communicating with elevated processes -- meaning the more important an application is, the less likely it is to get the message;</DIV></LI>
<LI>
<DIV mce_keep="true">The message does not go outside the session, meaning any other session remains unaware of the change -- woe to those who make these changes on a Terminal Server or the world of Fast User Switching!</DIV></LI></UL>
<P mce_keep="true">You get the idea.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">The design here is quite sensible for a bygone era, but to be honest something better&nbsp;might really be considered.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">But I digress.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">The point is that even a "well-behaved application" that sends the message and a "well-behaved application" that receive it might not ever be able to communicate well enough to be told that something is up.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">Despite the fact that the contents of a directory and the contents of a registry key were altered.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">So in the end, the rules (if you work within the framework above) end up being quite simple:</P>
<OL>
<LI>
<DIV mce_keep="true">If the font is there&nbsp;and the new one is determined to be the same font but of&nbsp;a lower or equal version&nbsp;, then you do not have to&nbsp;do anything;</DIV></LI>
<LI>
<DIV mce_keep="true">If the font was not there, then you can add it, add the registry information, and send the message; everything is as good as it can be, but other sessions and elevated processes&nbsp;might have to wait until next time;</DIV></LI>
<LI>
<DIV mce_keep="true">If the font is there&nbsp;and the new one&nbsp;is determined to be the same font but of a&nbsp;greater version, then you have to do all of the install work but it is much safer to require the reboot and do the actual file replacement at boot time.</DIV></LI></OL>
<P mce_keep="true">So pretty much the only time that you never have to do anything is when the font in question is already installed. when you didn't have to do anything.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">Yeesh. Talk about over-engineered! :-)</P>
<P mce_keep="true">In the next part of the series we'll talk about the mechanics of the install and uninstall that must happen....</P>
<P mce_keep="true">And in a later blog I will talk about my opinion of regular reader John Cowan's suggested "solution", <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/07/07/8699735.html#8706644" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/07/07/8699735.html#8706644">here</A>. :-)</P>

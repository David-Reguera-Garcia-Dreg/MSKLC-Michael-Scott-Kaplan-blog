<P>So I was at the Woodland Park Zoo tonight, where Aimee Mann was playing.</P>
<P>She has missed Seattle her last couple of times coming through this part of the country, so it was nice to her and hear some of the songs from the new album, live.</P>
<P>Though as venues go, it isn't my favorite.</P>
<P>There are just way too many people there who seem much more interested in going to the zoo with their kids and getting to take them to a show that they can get into free than people who are actually interested in listening to music, you know?</P>
<P>I don't mind kids. I used to babysit, I have worked in after-school programs and day care centers. I was even a nanny for a year!</P>
<P>But taking them to see an Aimee Mann show means that you have to be okay if the occasional curse word comes out of her mourh, since some of the words do....</P>
<P>Plus it was weird but the place I was sitting had a huge bunch of Marc Cohn fans rather than Aimee Mann fans, which was also a little distracting....</P>
<P>I ran into Kevin and Keith there and ended up sitting with them which was cool. Apparently we all like Aimee's music (it must drive Cathy nuts, now that I think about it; sorry, Cathy!).</P>
<P>I also learned something very important tonight.</P>
<P>You see I wanted to get the setlist for the show but I forgot a pen.</P>
<P>So I decided to use the <STRONG>facebook</STRONG> status updates from my phone to record them.</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/setlist.png" mce_src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/setlist.png"></P>
<P>What I discovered was that I would hate Twitter -- I can't even stand updating the status line this often!</P>
<P>But it ended up being a good show. I'm going to have to keep listening to the new album to see if gets me; I really did like some of the songs live that I hadn't gotten into before....</P>
<P>The setlist:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Stranger into Starman</LI>
<LI>Looking for Nothing</LI>
<LI>Freeway</LI>
<LI>Phoenix</LI>
<LI>Great Beyond</LI>
<LI>Save Me</LI>
<LI>Wise Up</LI>
<LI>&lt;an Elton John song I have blocked out&gt;</LI>
<LI>Goodbye Caroline</LI>
<LI>Medicine Wheel</LI>
<LI>Deathly</LI>
<LI>Thirty One Today</LI>
<LI>How am I Different?</LI></UL>
<P mce_keep="true">There is potential here -- maybe I should head down to the Portland show where the venue will be less distracting to me, and see the show there....</P>

<p>My twitter consists of the word &quot;Working&quot;, which I never change. &nbsp;I suppose when I go to sleep I could change it to &quot;Sleeping&quot;, but considering how I feel when I get up, I'm probably working really hard there too.</p></div>

<p>And you like Kathleen Edwards!</p>
<p>I must try everyone else in your list.</p></div>

<P>So after yesterday's blog (<A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/07/21/8760721.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/07/21/8760721.html"><STRONG>Behind facebook status like: "...somewhere between 'Addictive' by Faithless and 'Addicted' by Juliana Hatfield."</STRONG></A>), I had several people point out that there seemed to be something missing.</P>
<P>After all, I mentioned that each of the quotes would have:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P mce_keep="true"><FONT face="times new roman,times">...[as least] three meanings:</FONT></P>
<UL>
<LI>
<DIV mce_keep="true"><FONT face="times new roman,times">the mundane one that anyone can see even if they know nothing of either/both songs or even either/both artists;</FONT></DIV>
<LI>
<DIV mce_keep="true"><FONT face="times new roman,times">the deeper one involving some aspect of part of the underlying meanings/themes of the two songs;</FONT></DIV>
<LI>
<DIV mce_keep="true"><FONT face="times new roman,times">the deepest one involving the exact occurrence or memory or story or experience that I either know of or heard of that inspired me to add it.</FONT></DIV></LI></UL>
<P mce_keep="true"><FONT face="times new roman,times">But even if you only have one of these it can still be fun...</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Yes, that is right -- in my example I did not explain the third point.</P>
<P>I kind of thought the reason behind the omission would be self explanatory, wouldn't it?</P>
<P>Sometimes those deep personal things are really personal; many times they weren't even about me.</P>
<P>So sharing can feel like like a violation of someone's privacy (perhaps mine, perhaps not) and on the whole it seems exist to just not risk it.</P>
<P>I thought that was implied, but not everyone picked up on this point. Sorry about that!</P>
<P>I share a lot here, more than I ought, according to some.</P>
<P>But not everything is shared -- because in addition to all the above, sometimes <STRONG>the best little secrets are kept</STRONG>....</P>
<P>If it is something I feel comfortable blogging about, you'll likely see it.</P>

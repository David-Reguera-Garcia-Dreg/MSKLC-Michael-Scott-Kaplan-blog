<P>Friend and colleague and fellow keyboard expert who has written a tool for keyboard construction that I feel is much more impressive than mine <A class="" href="http://keyman.typepad.com/" mce_href="http://keyman.typepad.com/">Marc Durdin</A> recently blogged a blog on his Blog entitled <A class="" href="http://keyman.typepad.com/keyman_weblog/2008/06/robust-key-mess.html" mce_href="http://keyman.typepad.com/keyman_weblog/2008/06/robust-key-mess.html">Robust key message handling in Windows</A>.</P>
<P><EM>The permalink for the blog was one I found particularly amusing: </EM></P>

<P>:-)</P>
<P>This blog really covers many of the often complicated and often confusing issues I have covered over the years here, quite concisely.</P>
<P>I will briefly excerpt the one section most near and dear to my heart:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG><FONT face="times new roman,times">Shortcuts and Characters and Accelerators ... oh my</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times">Unfortunately, there is no clear guidance on precedence between these three types of input.&nbsp; Word does the following, which is fairly typical:</FONT></P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT face="times new roman,times"><STRONG>Shortcuts</STRONG> take precedence over <STRONG>characters</STRONG> - Ctrl+Alt+O switches to outline view </FONT>
<LI><FONT face="times new roman,times"><STRONG>Characters</STRONG> take precedence over <STRONG>access keys</STRONG> - AltGr+O generates the รณ character </FONT>
<LI><FONT face="times new roman,times">Left Alt+O will open the Format menu.</FONT></LI></UL>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times">That sounds almost like the best possible compromise.&nbsp; But is it?&nbsp; What if your computer does not have a right Alt key?&nbsp; Should Ctrl+Alt+O insert <STRONG>รณ</STRONG> or should it switch to Outline view?&nbsp; I believe that Word's current precedence is wrong:</FONT></P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT face="times new roman,times">There is an alternative method for accessing Outline view through the menu system; </FONT>
<LI><FONT face="times new roman,times">It is easy to redefine a particular shortcut if you really want to use it; </FONT>
<LI><FONT face="times new roman,times">It is not easy to redefine your keyboard layout, and accessing the <STRONG>รณ</STRONG> character through Insert|Symbol is painful.</FONT></LI></UL>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times">Unfortunately, Windows does not make changing this precedence easy for application authors -- in fact, it is </FONT><A href="http://keyman.typepad.com/keyman_weblog/2008/06/whats-wrong-wit.html"><FONT face="times new roman,times">basically impossible to do it robustly</FONT></A><FONT face="times new roman,times">.&nbsp; So, to make the best of a bad situation, let's stick with what Word does - at least it is familiar to end users!</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Yes, this is that issues I have gone on about in <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/04/17/577196.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/04/17/577196.html"><STRONG>Get off my freaking key!</STRONG></A> and many others, though he definitely went the extra mile to describe an aspect to it that I have never done in a blog before....</P>
<P>Anyway, <A class="" href="http://keyman.typepad.com/keyman_weblog/2008/06/robust-key-mess.html" mce_href="http://keyman.typepad.com/keyman_weblog/2008/06/robust-key-mess.html">Robust key message handling in Windows</A>&nbsp;is a really cool blog, so cool that I almost wish I had written it. :-)</P>
<P>But I am perfectly happy to point to the one who did. </P>
<P>I'll probably even be digging in to some of the aspects&nbsp; of it that I find particularly interesting in the future....</P>

<hr/><p><strong>Andrew Cook</strong> on 7 Aug 2008 12:43 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Word does provide another way to generate characters that it stomps on, for the most part. It has a series of deadkey-like chords for generating accent characters; for example, Ctrl-',O generates &quot;&#243;&quot;. The problem with this behavior is that it's not widely known and not extensively documented. Even to this day I have yet to run across a Spanish teacher who doesn't resort to Alt+0243 rather than AltGr-O, Ctrl-Alt-O, or Ctrl-',O</p></div>

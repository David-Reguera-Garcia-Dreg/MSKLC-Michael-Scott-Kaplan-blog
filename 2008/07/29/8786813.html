<hr/> <!-- Archival Source: ProcessPostNew -->
<P>There are many things that are beyond my scope of knowledge or power.</P>
<P>This blog is an attempt to clear out some of these items that ended upoon a TO DO list since they were sent to me via the Via the Contact link but I really can't do much with them.</P>
<P>If anyone has advice on the isses raised here, the Comments section is your scratchpad!</P>
<P>The first one from someone in Israel:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times">Dear Mr. Kaplan<BR><BR>...I am currently working on the production of a Chinese-Hebrew-Chinese dictionary. Could you please refer me to a DTP software that can<BR><BR>(1) generate a Chinese radical index,<BR>(2) generate Stoke count index, <BR>(3) generate a Pinyin Index, <BR>(4) support Hebrew fonts and <BR>(5) generate a Hebrew Index?<BR><BR>Many thanks in advance for your help,<BR><BR>Yours Sincerely,<BR>Ran</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>I really have no idea of a good software package to do this for a dictionary in any language, actually.</P>
<P>Sorry!</P>
<P>In another message, Elaine asked:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><SPAN lang=EN>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times">when opening my attached file it was encoding and could'nt read it can you please tell me what to do or going about how to decoding the attached file</FONT></P></SPAN></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>I really can't help here since (a) the file in question wasn't attached, and (b) there is no way to attach files to Contact link email.</P>
<P>Usually when I have files in a totally unknown encoding I push back on the source of the file -- what if it is some kind of script with ill intent/</P>
<P>Just kidding.</P>
<P>What I usually do is try to open it in Word, which does a fairly good job of trying to figuire out what the text is so it can be recovered....</P>
<P>Then there was a post from Tim:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times">Hi, I'm just getting started with Text Services Framework and was wondering if you could recommend any good resources.&nbsp; I read an older post which mentioned using .NET 2.0 with TSF.&nbsp; I'm particularly interested in leveraging C# for the TSF - but I'm not even sure if that is really feasible.<BR><BR>Hope all is well.<BR><BR>Respectfully,<BR>Tim</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>For creating actual Text Input Profiles, I have spoken at length about the lack of good documentation here, and I have aevedn explained how you cannot <STRONG>ever</STRONG> do this in managed code, as long as managed code only allows one version to be loaded per process. </P>
<P>For just using an existing one, it really depends on what one is trying to do, but there are not oodles of good resources there either.</P>
<P>Unfortunately.</P>
<P>Back to harder to understand communications, this one from Patrick had me scratching my head a bit:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><SPAN lang=EN>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times">Michael,<BR><BR>Picked up your linkage through your blog. Google suggested you have some zen related to correcting Outlook 2007 and Japanese. any help on this would be appreciated.</FONT></P></SPAN></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>No zen here, we're fresh out.</P>
<P>Sorry!</P>
<P>Anyway, you kind of get the idea. There are `27 other pieces of mail that are kind of along teh same lines, interleaved with about a little over 300 that aren't. I'm going to archive them all now, and as I have&nbsp;kind of explained the SIAO Dead Letter Office a bit, I won't feel guilty about never really responding.....</P>
<P mce_keep="true">&nbsp;</P>
<P><EM><FONT color=#ff00ff>All of the proposed characters in the rejected proposal for Klingon are sponsoring this post, especially U+xxE0&nbsp;KLINGON LETTER QH and U+xxE4&nbsp;KLINGON LETTER TLH</FONT></EM></P>
<hr/><p><strong>Eric C Brown</strong> on 30 Jul 2008 2:27 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Re TSF &amp; Managed code: &nbsp;</p>
<p>While you can't create a TIP (Text Input Processor) in managed code, you *can* create a text store (e.g., for a custom text editor) in managed code. &nbsp;It's not trivially easy, but then nothing about TSF is easy (sigh).</p></div>

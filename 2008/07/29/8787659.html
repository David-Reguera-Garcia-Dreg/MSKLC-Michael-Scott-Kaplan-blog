<P><FONT face="times new roman,times">Hi,<BR>I have a (physical) US keyboard.&nbsp; I often write emails to and about mainland Europe based people, and like to spell their names correctly.<BR>Typically I would remember some key sequences so that I could spell Jürgen's name correctly by typing J,ALT-0252,rgen etc.<BR>I found recently that by switching to a US-international keyboard in windows I can instead use RIGHTALT-u and RIGHTALT-y etc. for easier (more obvious at least) access to those accented characters.<BR>However, it has the side effect of causing me to be unable to write "echo", as the first quote followed by e causes ë to be written instead and i end up typing ""&lt;bksp&gt;e instead, which is a pain.<BR><BR>So - is there a better way (rather than using the character map application) for a US keyboard owner to type in accented characters but not be burdened with headaches around " and ' ?<BR>(I never really use the right alt (alt-gr I guess) in daily use, so it was convenient to use it for accented characters).<BR><BR>While I'm here, some supplemental points:<BR>1) your site appears to crash firefox3 pretty hard, for me at least<BR>2) I use tweakui to set "focus follows mouse".&nbsp; That's a pain when using the language bar because it switches languages back when you re-focus by moving the mouse.<BR><BR>Apologies if this is not the place to ask, but your blog seemed to have lots of relevant and useful information.<BR><BR>thanks,<BR>Richard</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In my book, the best/easiest way to handle this is:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Download/install <A class="" href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=82315&amp;clcid=0x409" mce_href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=82315&amp;clcid=0x409">MSKLC 1.4</A>;</LI>
<LI>Use the <STRONG>File|Load Existing Keyboard...</STRONG> menu option to load the US - International keyboard layout;</LI>
<LI>Modify the keyboard in whatever ways you see fit -- both removing the stuff you don't want and adding the stuff you do);</LI>
<LI>Build this new keyboard layout and install it on machines you use.</LI></OL>
<P>And then everything ends up better. :-)</P>
<P>Keep the keyboard layout around for the future, too. If it is what you are used to typing with, you'll probably want to use it again....</P>

<p>I find US-International pretty slick, but in Germany we don't have too many diacritics, so I'm probably not a good benchmark.</p>
<p>However, it took a while to find the EURO sign € on [Right-Alt] 5: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/keyboards/kbdusx.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/keyboards/kbdusx.htm</a></p></div>

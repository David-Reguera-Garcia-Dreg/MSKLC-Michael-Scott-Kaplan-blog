<P>Someone with the&nbsp;name <STRONG>handan</STRONG>&nbsp;asked me a question in a comment yesterday, a question that reminded me of something.</P>
<P>I think I have mentioned before that most of this blog's traffic comes from Google searches.</P>
<P>Like if you take a post like <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/01/08/349230.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/01/08/349230.html"><STRONG>How does it detect invalid characters?</STRONG></A> for a moment.</P>
<P>It was from January of 2005.</P>
<P>There are 847 unique referral entries outside of the blog&nbsp;(a few&nbsp;of which have&nbsp;lots of&nbsp;hits, suggesting links), and of that number 764 of them are from various Google pages across different languages (by comparison there were 42 across MSDN, MSN, and Live, most of which came from MSDN Search.</P>
<P>Anyway, when I read the question, I realized that the odds&nbsp;are&nbsp;that&nbsp;handan had probably reached that blog via Google. :-)</P>
<P><EM>I actually wore a Google shirt to work today, it tends to keep people on their toes, a-la-George Carlin, especially when you go to meetings with Search folks!</EM></P>
<P>Anyway, handan's question was:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times">ie6,7 display javascriot error <BR><BR>invalid characters.<BR><BR>why?<BR><BR>can you tell me ?<BR><BR>tks!</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Now obviously to any programming language, the definition of an invalid character is going to be a lot stricter than the loose definition of the one used by code page conversions, since anything that breaks the syntax rules for the language can qualify.</P>
<P>The flaw is not generally in IE in these cases -- it is in the pages themselves with the illegal or non-conformant ECMAScript (aka JScript, aka JavaScript).</P>
<P>The whole thing makes me wonder if I should add a better search to the page here. I tried adding Live Search once, but I couldn't get it to work. Perhaps they are subtly steering me to Google? :-)</P>

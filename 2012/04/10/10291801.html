<h1>Good times at MS, smooth sailing with my MS, and a new Ms.!</h1>

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Absolutely nothing technical today - it's a post about my life and how I am.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>f you have no real interest in that, then you should leave, and maybe come back tomorrow. I won't take it personally!</em></span></p>
<p>Let's relax for a moment and take my life and arbitrarily divide it into three areas, three places where there is opportunity for things to go well, to potentially be satisfied or pleased or dare I say happy:</p>
<ul>
<li>professionally (on the job);</li>
<li>personally (with health/wellness);</li>
<li>romantically (with a significant other).</li>
</ul>
<p>Generally one of them is going well at any given moment. ONE.</p>
<p>Analyzing them over time, there has not been a discernible pattern indicating that investing/not investing&nbsp;excessive time/effort in any of them changes how well or poorly&nbsp;they progress -- so it is generally not what I do that does the most to make me happier or less happy.</p>
<p>And it is not the "success" of one that makes another less successful most of the time, either.</p>
<p>It is almost unheard of for two of them to be where I'd essentially like them to be.</p>
<p>And it is quite unprecedented for all three of them to be in a good place simultaneously.</p>
<p>And yet somehow...</p>
<p>Somehow, over the last week or so, this seems to have happened!</p>
<p>Intellectually, I&nbsp;find myself tempted to work out those cynical muscles, to assume it won't last.</p>
<p>But I find myself not going down that particular road.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>For now, I'm just... happy.</p>
<p>Happy!</p>
<p>It's been a while, I suppose. But I'm just going to go with it -- enjoying my work at MS (Microsoft), a stable MS (multiple sclerosis) situation, and a new girlfriend (Ms. Claudia!) who thinks I'm somewhat wonderful....</p>
<p>I'm loving&nbsp;it. :-)</p>

<p>You rearrange my chromosones something wonderful, Mr. Kaplan. </p>

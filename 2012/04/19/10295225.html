<p>Sound familiar?</p>
<p>Think back.</p>
<p>The year was 2008.</p>
<p>The month was April.</p>
<p>The Blog was Sorting it all Out.</p>
<p>The blog was&nbsp;<strong><a title="I Adar you! Hell, I Double Adar you!" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/04/25/8423349.html">I Adar you! Hell, I Double Adar you!</a></strong>.</p>
<p>The bug clearly still repros.</p>
<p>One funny twist on the story....</p>
<p>Not funny ha-ha, but funny ironic, kinda.</p>
<p>My Blog, or to be specific that <strong>Adar</strong> blog, was referenced in the "won't fix" resolution:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">Also we learned Michael Kaplan already has a blog regarding this issue which will help people understand Windows behavior.</span></em></p>
<p>I suppose I should be flattered....</p>
<p>Honestly, it almost makes me want to change my writing style to be more severe about bugs, and less willing to try to be&nbsp;entertaining if blogs in my Blog are cited in the justification to not fix&nbsp;a bug!</p>
<p>Sigh.</p>
<p>I suppose I should just let it go.</p>
<p>Because there's more!</p>
<p>I can't tell you yet, but almost.</p>
<p>Stay tuned....</p>

Willett and Manheim:</p>
<p>After the uprising of the 17th of June </p>
<p>The Secretary of the Writers Union </p>
<p>Had leaflets distributed in the Stalinallee </p>
<p>Stating that the people </p>
<p>Had forfeited the confidence of the government </p>
<p>And could win it back only </p>
<p>By redoubled efforts. &nbsp;Would it not be easier </p>
<p>In that case for the government </p>
<p>To dissolve the people </p>
<p>And elect another?</p>

<p><strong>John Cowan</strong> on 19 Apr 2012 11:42 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>By the way, I am now convinced that the blogs.msdn.com server times how long it has been since it sent me the page I&#39;m trying to comment on, and if it&#39;s more than about a minute, the posting is silently rejected. &nbsp;Perhaps this is an effort to prevent commenters from overthinking?</p>
<p>So I now write my comment taking as long as I want, copy it to the clipboard, hit Post knowing that it will take me straight back to the same page while ignoring my comment, paste the comment back in, add my name, and hit Post again.</p>
<p>I wrote this one quickly (unlike the previous one), so let&#39;s see if it makes it within the deadline. &nbsp;But I&#39;m copying it too, just to be sure....</p>

<p><strong>John Cowan</strong> on 19 Apr 2012 11:43 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Yup, that was fast enough.</p>

<p><strong>Simon Buchan</strong> on 19 Apr 2012 4:06 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>@John: It&#39;s a known bug (probably session timeout related or something stupid) - Raymond Chen got the complaints the worst I think, but it&#39;s quieted down . It sucks for me since I tend to open tabs in the background and look at them when I have time.</p>

<p><strong>WndSks</strong> on 19 Apr 2012 6:56 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>@John: Yeah this is a known problem with the blogging software they use. Copy your text, then refresh the page before you post is the most reliable way. (If it worked you get the #comment posted anchor in the URL and the green box above the comments on most of the blogs)</p>

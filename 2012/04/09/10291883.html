<p>The question was simple enough:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">I have a cmd line tool. On French Windows its output is correct in the cmd window but when I redirect it to a file it is no longer good. I noticed that if I set the output encoding on the Console class explicitly to the default encoding then redirecting to a file works fine:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Console.OutputEncoding = Encoding.Default;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">Does anyone know why the default encoding is not set by default? Is there any reason why I shouldn&rsquo;t put the line above in my code?</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">Thanks</span></p>
<p>Wow, if there was ever a property to avoid, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.text.encoding.default.aspx">Encoding.Default</a> would be it.</p>
<p>As the MSDN topic explains, it is the default system ANSI code page - in other words the <strong>CP_ACP</strong>, the code page used by non-Unicode Windows applications and the programs that can read/write non-Unicode files.</p>
<p>Like the default .TXT file type handler, NOTEPAD.EXE.</p>
<p>Console applications, on the other hand, use <strong>CP_OEMCP</strong> by default, which is why the described problem is happening.</p>
<p>Because <strong>CP_ACP</strong> and <strong>CP_OEMCP</strong> are not the same thing, for a lot&nbsp;of different default system locales.</p>
<p>And if there is anything that the <strong>CP_ACP</strong> and the CP_OEMCP have in common, it is that they both act as non-overlapping subsets of Unicode</p>
<p>Now some console apps can support all of Unicode, in which case CP_UTF8 is a better use of <strong>Encoding</strong>. Or it cannot support any change, in which case using <strong>Encoding.Default</strong> will be talking text that is filtered through <strong>CP_OEMCP</strong> is and then add a <strong>CP_ACP</strong> filter as well....</p>
<p>In the end, you should go&nbsp;UP to UTF-8, or least if Unicode won't work, then <strong>CP_OEMCP</strong> should be left alone....</p>

<p>Of course, if your output is to a pipe to a tool that expects OEM text, such as, I don&#39;t know, &quot;more&quot;, then you really do need it in CP_OEMCP. On balance it&#39;s probably best to have a specific option for making output files (in whatever encoding), use WriteConsoleW for console output, and just leave things alone if the output is a pipe.</p>

<p>So in order to understand this story, we have to travel into the before time.</p>
<p>Into the long long ago.</p>
<p>Because it hasn't always been the way it was yesterday.</p>
<p>Or even the day before that.</p>
<p>So I'll channel my Helen Buday, and&nbsp;I'll do the tell, so that we 'member who we was and where we came from...</p>
<p>Steven Sinofsky was a Senior VP, and both he and the Ronettes were still over in Office-ville.</p>
<p>BrianV was still at Microsoft, and Soma was still in Windows reporting to him.</p>
<p>Soma owned two different groups -- WinSE (Windows Sustained Engineering) and International.</p>
<p>International was run by Lori Brownell and&nbsp;was&nbsp;the team I was on in building 28, while WinSE was in building 24.</p>
<p>Its like you're there, right? :-)</p>
<p>And then....</p>
<p>And then...</p>
<p>There were some problems in building 24.</p>
<p>Problems in the labs.</p>
<p>You know, some brownouts, maybe even an electrical&nbsp;fire or two (depends on who you ask).</p>
<p>Soma looked at these twp groups and decided to switch 'em.</p>
<p>We moved to building 24, and WinSE moved to 28.</p>
<p>Strictly logical reasons for the move, mind you.</p>
<p>I mean&nbsp;both groups&nbsp;had labs, but WinSE had a lot more of 'em and higher power consumption for 'em, too.</p>
<p>Since he could fit the moves in his budget for the FY and he owned both groups, it was all inside baseball, much easier than anything else would have been.</p>
<p>For some of those&nbsp;who ended up in&nbsp;moved to 24, a different message was kind of implied.</p>
<p>Basically, if Microsoft had to decide which group was going to be burned to the ground, the Windows International team "won" the contest....</p>
<p>Years passed.</p>
<p>Some&nbsp;people moved on.</p>
<p>Others moved over.</p>
<p>And still others moved up.</p>
<p>And yet even now that so much has changed, I never was unable to unlearn that lesson.</p>
<p>To unring that bell.</p>
<p>If they had to choose which group to have burst into flame....</p>

From my view it&#39;s just Windows International team has lower power consumption but inside a building wired with higher power limit. Exchange building seems to be logical choice in management standpoint because you don&#39;t need the budget and possibly dayoffs for rewiring the building 24.</p>
<p>I mean unless the enviornment, etc. of building 24 is worse than 28...... :O</p>

<h1>How often should you read my Blog? Use the RATIO between blogs you don't like and blogs you do, and divide!</h1>

<p>Not everyone reads my Blog.</p>
<p>And I'm not just talking about everyone in the world.</p>
<p>Or everyone in the country.</p>
<p>Or everyone in the city.</p>
<p>Or everyone at Microsoft.</p>
<p>Frankly, not even all the people on my team read it.</p>
<p>Hell, I am pretty sure that most days my boss's boss and boss's boss's boss might not have seen it!</p>
<p>So perhaps I should not be surprised about how even though previously, in blogs like <strong><a title="The evolving Story of Locale Support, part 12: Logic dictates that we keep a sense of proportion about the RATIO" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2011/12/09/10246051.html">The evolving Story of Locale Support, part 12: Logic dictates that we keep a sense of proportion about the RATIO</a></strong> and especially&nbsp;<strong><a title="Keeping a sense of *order* about the RATIO!" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2012/02/09/10265712.html">Keeping a sense of *order* about the RATIO!</a></strong>, that people might be surprised about time values getting flipped in Arabic when they were using format strings like:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: courier new,courier;"><strong>IDS_DURATION_HOURS_FMT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; L"hh\x2236mm\x2236ss" // {Locked}</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: courier new,courier;"><strong>IDS_DURATION_MINUTES_FMT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; L"mm\x2236ss"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // {Locked}</strong></span></p>
<p>See that RATIO in there?</p>
<p>Same bug, different place.</p>
<p>They just got the message that their existing fix was not to be taken as a&nbsp;seminal technical decision....</p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier new,courier;"><strong>IDS_DURATION_HOURS_FMT_RTL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; L"ss\x2236mm\x2236hh" // {Locked}</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: courier new,courier;"><strong>IDS_DURATION_MINUTES_FMT_RTL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; L"ss\x2236mm"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // {Locked}</strong></span></p>
<p>Well, I guess that might work sometimes, right?</p>
<p>Sigh.</p>
<p>Le Sigh, in fact.</p>
<p>Anyhow, <strong><a title="Keeping a sense of *order* about the RATIO!" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2012/02/09/10265712.html">Keeping a sense of *order* about the RATIO!</a></strong> has the correct fix here.</p>
<p>And I really don't need everyone to think it needs to be part of their job to read my Blog -- even if they are in WIT (Windows International Test), or WWLI (my own group), and they have to deal with the kinds of bugs regularly that I tend to cover.</p>
<p>After all, I'll mention it when the problem reaches me.</p>
<p>Hell, I don't even expect Claudia to read every single blog, so everyone else is off the hook.</p>
<p>Though between you and me and &gt;1500 others who see my blogs within the first 18 hours, you may well&nbsp;find your problems solved faster, or at all,&nbsp;if you do! :-)</p>

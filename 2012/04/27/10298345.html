<h1>Should considering UTF-16 be harmful be considered harmful?</h1>

<p>Like many of the people I know, I find myself looking over at Stack Overflow and related sites periodically, sites like programmers.stackexchange.com.</p>
<p>I'm usually pleased to pop in.</p>
<p>I'll admit it is seldom relevant to me these days, since I don't do so much dev work, and the work I do is usually just in my particular area.</p>
<p>But it still can&nbsp;be interesting.</p>
<p>Once in a while, it is even in my area!</p>
<p>For example, there is a question about code page conversion that touches on my "Pseudo Form V Normalization" issues <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7703114/using-widechartomultibyte-with-codepage-1258-vietnamese">here</a>,&nbsp;and as far as I can tell the problem was solved independantly (the article cites a few of my blogs but does not seem to notice the Form V ones)....</p>
<p>And like the other day, when I saw yet another pingback to my blogs <strong><a title="BACKSPACE vs. DELETE" href="../../../2005/12/21/506248.html">BACKSPACE vs. DELETE</a></strong> and&nbsp;<strong><a title="I think MaxLength needs protection to assure safer text" href="../../../2010/12/15/10105168.html">I think MaxLength needs protection to assure safer text</a></strong>, the latter of which also includes a comment by regular reader Yuhong Bao pointing to the Stack Overflow article that this blog today is kind of about:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: large;"><a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/102205/should-utf-16-be-considered-harmful">Should UTF-16 be considered harmful?</a></span></p>
<p>At the time, my comment to Yuhong Bao's link was:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>I find that article to be rather naive, alarmist, and biased, myself.</em></p>
<p>This roughly mirrors my current feelings on the subject.:-)</p>
<p>One can argue about how complicated UTF-8 is given its crazy character boundaries.</p>
<p>Or about how huge UTF-32 with empty space in every character, and how it routinely fools people who should know better that it fixes the problems of UTF-16.</p>
<p>Or, as with that blog, with whether UTF-16 is harmful.</p>
<p>I find my <strong><a title="UCS-2 to UTF-16 series" href="../../../2009/06/10/9723321.html">UCS-2 to UTF-16 series</a></strong>, with its mix of bug reports of best practices and aspirational suggestions to be a much more reasonable about improving your code.</p>
<p>It was almost like one of those trains that you could get off of at any stop -- you never have to ride it to the end if it takes you as far as you wanted to go.</p>
<p>Now contrast that with <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/102205/should-utf-16-be-considered-harmful">Should UTF-16 be considered harmful?</a>, which is not really built to be helpful, even as it catalogs various problems.</p>
<p>By no means is it Stack Overflow at its best....</p>
<p>Now there&nbsp;is also a ton of useful content, too.</p>
<p>Maybe if this article didn't keep sending me pingbacks to remind me it's there, I wouldn't feel the need to comment. :-)</p>

<p><strong>Pavel Radzivilovsky</strong> on 2 May 2012 7:23 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Dear Michael,</p>
<p>I really suggest you invest some time in reading www dot utf8everywhere dot org. I hope this has potential to convince you. Following the discussion which you mentioned, started by none other than by the author of Boost.Locale, we compiled all arguments and counter-arguments and addressed them in this document.</p>
<p>I&#39;d really appreciate your opinion on that.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 3 May 2012 2:30 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Again, interesting yet unrealistic to think it matters to even 0.05% of developers in the real world.</p>

<p><strong>B. Bill</strong> on 3 May 2012 3:12 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Interesting yet unrealistic to think your UCS-2 to UTF-16 matters to even 0.05% of developers in the real world. No one, and I repeat it, *NO ONE*, except those who write Unicode algorithms, or text rendering engines, should care about encodings. The only way to do this is to standardize on *one* encoding. And the more you resist, the more harm you do to the world.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 3 May 2012 3:45 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>I wish you luck in your aspirations, but no way will we ever have just one encoding form or scheme. </p>
<p>Life is about dealing with things as they are; deprecating thousands of functions and dozens of programming languages affecting hundreds of millions of people is never gonna happen.</p>

<p><strong>pavel</strong> on 27 May 2012 1:12 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Michael, </p>
<p>since utf8everywhere is in the air and has 200 visitors per day on average, I suggest you take some time to address the claims more seriously. Maybe changing the title of your post can also help :)</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

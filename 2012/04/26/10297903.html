<h1>Michael's Keyboard Laws for Developers, Part 5</h1>

<p>It was almost 4&frac12; years ago that I wrote some basic rules.</p>
<p>Rules for developers.</p>
<p>Rules for developers about keyboards.</p>
<p>I was even faux pompous enough to refer to them as my <strong>Michael's Keyboard Laws for Developers</strong>. :-)</p>
<p>The first law: <span style="font-size: large;"><strong><a title="VK_A is not always 'A'" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/11/15/6252257.html">VK_A is not always 'A'</a></strong></span>.</p>
<p>The second law: <span style="font-size: large;"><strong><a title="Not every keyboard contains every VK_* value" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/11/16/6298366.html">Not every keyboard contains every VK_* value</a></strong></span>.</p>
<p>The third law: <span style="font-size: large;"><strong><a title="Not every keyboard contains every character" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/11/20/6420601.html">Not every keyboard contains every character</a></strong></span>.</p>
<p>The fourth law: <span style="font-size: large;"><strong><a title="Not every individual keystroke is relevant" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/11/21/6456468.html">Not every individual keystroke is relevant</a></strong></span>.</p>
<p>Now over those 4&frac12; years, I have been able to answer <strong>49</strong> different questions sent to me by email with at least one of those laws.</p>
<p>Then, yesterday, a new situation came up.</p>
<p>One that was not covered by the laws.</p>
<p>I realized that perhaps a new law would be needed.</p>
<p>And to prove that I am more efficient than the US Congress (even under the best of circumstances, which these days certainly aren't!), that law is being posted just 24 hours later! :-)</p>
<p>This law is somewhat obvious, but the consequences of it aren't always so obvious, even after the issue -- and the law -- have been pointed out.</p>
<p>And now, without further adieu, the fifth of <strong>Michael's Keyboard Laws for Developers</strong>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="font-size: x-large;">&lt;CTRL&gt;+&lt;C&gt;&nbsp;and &lt;CTRL&gt;+&lt;ALT&gt;+C will stop each other from doing their jobs</span></strong></p>
<p>You might&nbsp;wonder why I would find it so important that I make this a law, when it seemed like I had closed the Canon over 1600 days ago.</p>
<p>Especially when it seems so obvious!</p>
<p>Well, perhaps if I expanded the <strong>fifth law</strong> with a corollary of sorts, to act as a proof for my claim that non-obvious consequences exist:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">&lt;CTRL&gt;+&lt;C&gt;&nbsp;and &lt;CTRL&gt;+&lt;ALT&gt;+C will stop each other from doing their jobs, and &lt;CTRL&gt;+&lt;ALT&gt;+C is the same thing as&nbsp;&lt;ALTGR&gt;+&lt;C&gt;</span></strong></p>
<p>Recognize the issue now?</p>
<p>The one where Word's "helpful" shortcuts so frequently stomp on keyboard letter assignments?</p>
<p>It's the one I talked about in previously in blogs like <strong><a title="'To start press the ALTGR key.' Hmm... where's the ALTGR key?" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2004/12/28/333168.html">'To start press the ALTGR key.' Hmm... where's the ALTGR key?</a></strong> and <strong><a title="Intuitive is in the eye of the beholder" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/04/21/410305.html">Intuitive is in the eye of the beholder</a></strong> and <strong><a title="Multilingual keyboards and Microsoft Word" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/03/15/552031.html">Multilingual keyboards and Microsoft Word</a></strong> and <strong><a title="Get off my freaking key!" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/04/17/577196.html">Get off my freaking key!</a>&nbsp;</strong>and <strong><a title="Detecting ALTGR can only hope to work when ALTGR is in fact there...." href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/09/08/4825659.html">Detecting ALTGR can only hope to work when ALTGR is in fact there....</a></strong> and <strong><a title="Detecting ALTGR fails when ALTGR isn't there (Just Czech-ed out in Word 2007)" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/11/16/6291947.html">Detecting ALTGR fails when ALTGR isn't there (Just Czech-ed out in Word 2007)</a></strong> and <strong><a title="Virtual PC + Word 2007 &ne; AltGr support?" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/01/17/7126999.html">Virtual PC + Word 2007 &ne; AltGr support?</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Every single one of these seven blogs was inspired by people asking about problems related to this issue.</p>
<p>Raymond Chen even mentioned some of the consequences here, in <a title="Why Ctrl+Alt shouldn't be used as a shortcut modifier" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2004/03/29/101121.aspx">Why Ctrl+Alt shouldn't be used as a shortcut modifier</a>.</p>
<p>And I talked about Tavultesoft's&nbsp;Marc Durdin's advice to Word on how to handle themselves less stupidly (<a href="http://keyman.typepad.com/keyman_weblog/2008/06/robust-key-mess.html">Robust key message handling in Windows</a>) in <strong><a title="The key to key messages is a key contribution" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/07/04/8687005.html">The key to key messages is a key contribution</a></strong>.</p>
<p>With all that coverage, I'd say people should have wondered why there wasn't a law, and that it was about time someone made it one....</p>
<p>THUS, this blog today!</p>
<p>Now, the specific case in the problem brought up so recently was in a Windows 8 component related to&nbsp;PowerShell where they found their handling of <strong>&lt;CTRL&gt;+Q</strong> interrupting the Hungarian keyboard's handling of <strong>&lt;AltGr&gt;+Q</strong>, since it is also <strong>&lt;CTRL&gt;+&lt;ALT&gt;+Q</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/3377.whoopsq.jpg"><img title="The Q that almost wasn't!" border="0" alt="The Q that almost wasn't!" src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/3377.whoopsq.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>They were going to fix this bug even before I pointed out the wider issue covered by this law, which may suggest to some that in at least some ways PowerShell is more World Ready than Word, which hasn't fixed this issue in their product despite 8 blogs from me over a&nbsp;4 year period, one of which included a link to specific instructions/suggestions on how to fix/ameliorate the problem.</p>
<p>But that might come off as bitter, so I'm not going to go there today. ;-)</p>
<p>In actuality, this blog today has an entirely different purpose.</p>
<p>Today's blog, as well as the other four <strong>Michael's Keyboard Laws for Developers</strong>, are something I will&nbsp;be using to provide serious guidance for an issue that an STE&nbsp;or SDE/T&nbsp;might find even more useful.</p>
<p>Something I will be talking about soon in another blog....</p>
<hr/><p><strong>Random832</strong> on 26 Apr 2012 9:13 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>&quot;&lt;CTRL&gt;+&lt;C&gt; and &lt;CTRL&gt;+&lt;ALT&gt;+C will stop each other from doing their jobs&quot;</p>
<p>Why is this? They&#39;re easily distinguished - surely there&#39;s a way to detect that alt is not pressed.</p>

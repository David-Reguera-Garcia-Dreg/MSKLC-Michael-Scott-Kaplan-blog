<p>Yesterday in <strong><a title="When you have two different models, the easiest place to fall short is in the interaction between 'em..." href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2012/04/02/10289808.html">When you have two different models, the easiest place to fall short is in the interaction between 'em&hellip;</a></strong>, I talked about the problems with the way there were two different models for time and date formatting, one of them clearly inadequate.</p>
<p>And how over the last several versions of Windows that POSIX model for date/time formatting had largely been gutted, to avoid duplication and the bugs that can, and occasionally have, come from duplication.</p>
<p>A pretty satisfactorily happy ending to the story, right?</p>
<p>Well, yes.</p>
<p>In fact, there is just one problem here.</p>
<p>And by one problem, I mean three problems: the formatting of numbers, currency, and percent values.</p>
<p>All three are supported only by&nbsp;(for lack of a better term, since some if them are in fact POSIX based)&nbsp;"POSIX"-style settings.</p>
<p>And we try to make up for the problems there by being somewhat exhaustive in our options.</p>
<p>The price?</p>
<p>Well, rather than a small number of properties, we have all of the following:</p>
<p>LOCALE_ICURRENCY, LOCALE_IDIGITS, LOCALE_IINTLCURRDIGITS, LOCALE_IMONLZERO, LOCALE_INEGATIVEPERCENT, LOCALE_INEGCURR, LOCALE_INEGNUMBER, LOCALE_INEGSEPBYSPACE, LOCALE_INEGSIGNPOSN, LOCALE_INEGSYMPRECEDES, LOCALE_IPOSITIVEPERCENT, LOCALE_IPOSSEPBYSPACE, LOCALE_IPOSSIGNPOSN, LOCALE_IPOSSYMPRECEDES, LOCALE_SCURRENCY, LOCALE_SDECIMAL, LOCALE_SGROUPING, LOCALE_SMONDECIMALSEP, LOCALE_SMONGROUPING, LOCALE_SMONTHOUSANDSEP, LOCALE_SNEGATIVESIGN, LOCALE_SPERCENT, LOCALE_SPOSITIVESIGN, and LOCALE_STHOUSAND.</p>
<p>A lot of them are closely connected and interdependent. Enough so that the table at the bottom of <a title="Locale Information Constants" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd464799.aspx">Locale Information Constants</a>:</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Closely Related Locale Information Constants</b></p>
<p>Many of the locale information constants previously listed are closely related, so that changing one affects the value of the others. The following table shows the relationships among these constants.</p>
<table border="1" align="centetr">
<tbody>
<tr><th>Value</th><th>Constants affected</th></tr>

<hr />
<p>&nbsp;is all quite woefully inadequate since all it really tries to cover is a few fields that you can change; the rest of the spaghetti mess isn't covered anywhere!</p>
<p>Well, okay.</p>
<p>Who cares if you need to take 24 separate properties with mostly undocumented&nbsp;connections between them&nbsp;instead of a much smaller number of properties with clear dependencies, as long as everything is covered, right?</p>
<p>I mean, it's not like we've never had confusing stuff come out of Microsoft before!</p>
<p>All things considered, we could forgive all this if support was adequate.</p>
<p><em>Do you hear the evil music soundtrack playing now?</em></p>
<p>Because despite those 24 properties, there is something missing here.</p>
<p>Something fairly crucial.</p>
<p>Like whether to put&nbsp;a positive sign in front of&nbsp;(or right next to in some other way)&nbsp;a number.</p>
<p>Try it out, see if you can figure out how to do it.</p>
<p>I'll wait.</p>
<p><strong>Hint: there is no way to do it</strong>.</p>
<p>Didn't you ever wonder why they took out the LOCALE_SPOSITIVESIGN from intl.cpl and the example so seldom has a plus sign in it?</p>
<p><a href="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/0640.number01.jpg"><img title="The Numbers format details in Regional Options" border="0" alt="The Numbers format details in Regional Options" src="http://blogs.msdn.com/resized-image.ashx/__size/550x0/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-33-81/0640.number01.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>I think they notice that LOCALE_SPOSITIVESIGN wasn't really getting used! :-)</p>
<p>Whopsie Daisy!</p>
<p>Now all of this becomes an interesting challenge as one considers what WinRT's <a title="Windows.Globalization.NumberFormatting namespace" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.globalization.numberformatting.aspx">Windows.Globalization.NumberFormatting namespace</a> could do here -- since in so many ways it uses a superior model for these thiings.</p>
<p>Well, except for trying to get the data from NLS on points like this one, I mean. Though one sometimes turns to one's parents for ideas/advice.</p>
<p>Oh well, there's always some random future version to work all of this out.</p>
<p>Or they'll probably figure something out for this version for the Modern stuff.</p>
<p>I should probably start talking about that new&nbsp;stuff one of these days, instead of just obliquely referencing it, huh? :-)</p>

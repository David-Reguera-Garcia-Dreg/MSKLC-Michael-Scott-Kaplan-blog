<p>The other day in <strong><a title="The evolving Story of Locale Support, part 22: Digit Substitution 2.0" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2012/04/12/10292952.html">The evolving Story of Locale Support, part 22: Digit Substitution 2.0</a></strong>, I waxed on quite enthusiastically about the capabilities of Digit Substitution in the Windows Runtime (WinRT).</p>
 <p>Since then. I've had a bunch of people ask me to provide some more details to justify me interest, and my excitement.</p>
 <p>Okay, fair enough.</p>
 <p>Not everyone can read my mind, after all! :-)</p>
 <p><strong>First and foremost</strong> is that it negates the need to heavily worry about the IE discussed in <strong><a title="Suddenly, in a bit more time than a blink of an eye, 'standards support' becomes 'less i18n support'" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2010/11/12/10088056.html">Suddenly, in a bit more time than a blink of an eye, 'standards support' becomes 'less i18n support'</a></strong>. Developers of applications can use the WinRT globalization to work around the fact that Internet Explorer decided to not do any of the support provided previously.</p>
 <p>The new design gets around many previous limitations, like how the old support was a rendering-based illusion, that the underlying numbers were still plain old 0-9.</p>
 <p>And the fact that there was no good way to distinguish the "illusion" numbers provided by <strong>Digit Substitution</strong> and actual native digits (which exist on some keyboards and in Unicode). That built-in sense of confusion is something that many will be happy to see start to go away.</p>
 <p>Support for different sets of digits depending&nbsp;on scenario if just really amazing for those who need it.</p>
 <p>And the ability to display the plain old ASCII style digits when you need to -- even when set to <strong>National</strong> digit support, improves the story further.</p>
 <p>The lack of keyboard support in so many cases? Who cares? ;-)</p>
 <p>You should also include the fact that you don't need to rely on a single, global setting per user.</p>
 <p>Parsing support? No one can even pretend that isn't really&nbsp;cool....</p>
 <p><strong><span style="font-size: large;">Excited now?</span></strong></p>
 <p>Holy crap, I want to try to use the new support in older apps to see how much I can use it there!</p>

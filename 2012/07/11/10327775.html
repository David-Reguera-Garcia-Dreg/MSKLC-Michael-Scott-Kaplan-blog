<p>As we come closer and closer to the ongoing march to releasing Windows 8, it starts to feel like preparing for something.</p>
<p>A ceremony of some kind.</p>
<p>Like some sort of <strong>wedding</strong>.</p>
<p>Cool!</p>
<p>Okay, let's talk about some locale data, as if we were bridesmaids trying to help a somewhat lazy bride who didn't want to do all the work herself....</p>
<p><em>This shouldn't offend anybody, right?</em>&nbsp; :-)</p>
<p>Okay, first we have something <strong><span style="font-size: xx-large;">old</span>.</strong></p>
<p>For this, we have the long date format, a.k.a. <a title="LOCALE_SLONGDATE" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd373854">LOCALE_SLONGDATE</a>.</p>
<p>That one has been around for nearly two decades.</p>
<p>And in Win32 locale nomenclature, that's <strong>old</strong>!</p>
<p>Now we did update some long date entries based on feedback, but it is largely the same as it ever was.</p>
<p>Perfect for our blushing bride!</p>
<p>We need to find something <span style="font-size: xx-large;"><strong>new</strong></span>, now.</p>
<p>I've got just the thing.</p>
<p>We added a new <strong>lock screen date format</strong>, which is almost a long date (mostly we just take the year off of a long date, though in some cases we independently have something different).</p>
<p>It's essentially a special "Day/Month/Date" format, not unlike a single line version of the one used on the <strong>Windows Phone</strong> lock screen:</p>
<p><a href="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/8875.lockscreen01.jpg"><img style="max-width: 550px;" border="0" alt="" src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/8875.lockscreen01.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>That format is not explicitly exposed to developers or documented for them, though I'm told one or two <span style="text-decoration: line-through;"><span style="color: #999999; text-decoration: line-through;">lifeless</span></span>clever folks have figured out how to dig it out.</p>
<p>All I will say is that they didn't get help from me!</p>
<p>They're on their own.</p>
<p>For Cherokee, it's kind of like a dddd, MMMM, d kind of thing, which you can [blurily] see, above.</p>
<p>Anyway, it is a quite visible and&nbsp;<strong>new</strong> thing!</p>
<p>Anyway, we now have to find something <span style="font-size: xx-large;"><strong>borrowed</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Crap, how can we have something we borrow?</p>
<p>It seems kind of trite to say we borrowed the <strong>Metro</strong> user interface. Especially since we kind of improved on it in some&nbsp;ways - ways that they will be able to pick up themselves now.</p>
<p>How about if we borrow something that is there already, kinda?</p>
<p>And we'll just repurpose it!</p>
<p>Specifically, we'll&nbsp;borrow the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd373855">LOCALE_SMONTHDATE</a> format.</p>
<p>And we'll change it a little bit, as I will explain in a moment.</p>
<p>We'll cleverly take the <strong>new</strong> item above, the "lock screen" format, to decide where the DAY goes (on top or on the bottom of the SMONTHDATE), i.e.</p>
<p>MMMM d</p>
<p>and then putting with the day name (which&nbsp;is&nbsp;first) on top, i.e.</p>
<p>dddd<br />MMMM d</p>
<p>for Cherokee:</p>
<p><a href="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/0564.tdbn.jpg"><img title="The new TDBN (Time/Date/Battery/Network) display" border="0" alt="The new TDBN (Time/Date/Battery/Network) display" src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/0564.tdbn.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;and for Turkish, i.e.</p>
<p>d MMMM</p>
<p>and then putting the day name (which is last) on the bottom, i.e.</p>
<p>d MMMM<br />dddd</p>
<p>for Turkish:</p>
<p><a href="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/0243.tdbn02.jpg"><img style="max-width: 550px;" border="0" alt="" src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/0243.tdbn02.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Perhaps it would have been easier to add a whole new format than such a tortuous algorithm (some people suggested as much), but it the end it allows these two exciting pieces of Windows 8 user interface to be quite visible and available.</p>
<p>That <strong>TDBN</strong> (Time/Date/Battery/Network) display box is readily available by hitting <strong>WindowsKey+C </strong>pretty much anywhere in Windows 8,&nbsp;and the lock screen is what you see any time you lock the user interface of hit <strong>WindowsKey+L</strong>.</p>
<p>All <strong>borrowed</strong> from existing settings!</p>
<p>Now we get to the next bit, which according to the tradition, should be something <span style="font-size: xx-large;"><strong>Blue</strong></span>, riight?</p>
<p>But I'm having trouble figuring out what that should be.</p>
<p>I need something that rhymes with <strong>blue</strong> I think, or the scansion will be messed up.</p>
<p>Hmmmm.</p>
<p>I'll figure it out to finish up this wedding ceremony prep, in the next part.</p>
<p>Stay tuned....</p>

<p>Le sigh.</p>
<p>They moved my Exchange mailbox to a new server.</p>
<p>It started with an e-mail:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;" size="3"><span face="Calibri">Hello,</span></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;" size="3"><span face="Calibri">This is a notification to all mailboxes on Segroup, we are in the middle of the planning stages for retiring Segroup. This means all mailboxes on Segroup will eventually need to be moved off. In the near future we will begin scheduling migrations, however this message is to bring this to your attention ahead of time.</span></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;" size="3"><span face="Calibri">If you have any concerns with this process please small &lsquo;r&rsquo; reply letting me know, along with details pertaining to why.</span></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;" size="3"><span face="Calibri">Please ignore this message if you already read it, as I will be sending it out multiple times this week to ensure its reached all the attended mailboxes.</span></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">Thank you,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">James</span></p>
<p>Le sigh.</p>
<p>I wasn't alone on the server, mind you. Lots of people got this email.</p>
<p>Of course it has happened before.</p>
<p>I started life on one mail server on a different domain before I got moved to this one.</p>
<p>Some Brian Valentine "If you work in Windows and you aren't into NTDEV then I'd like to screw with you to beta test something of mine" project.</p>
<p>For years I couldn't reliably use wireless or sign code or send&nbsp;secure email.</p>
<p>Now that those things work, of course they're making a switch.</p>
<p>Le sigh.</p>
<p>Anyway, James assured me that the new server had more space, and more rules allowed.</p>
<p>Once I updated my mobile device and got my new OWA link, everything would be the same.</p>
<p>Le sigh.</p>
<p>Anyway, they made the move.</p>
<p>Just the email server, mind you. My login is in the old place.</p>
<p>Whatever, at least it's done.</p>
<p>Oh wait.</p>
<p>I have started getting emails to personal account&nbsp;like this one:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">Hi Michael,</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">This is forwarded to your email address from the Unicode list as it bounced from the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">Microsoft one I have for you</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">(<a href="http://wm.seanet.com/src/compose.php?send_to=michkap%40winse.microsoft.com">michkap@winse.microsoft.com</a>&lt;mailto:<a href="http://wm.seanet.com/src/compose.php?send_to=michkap%40winse.microsoft.com">michkap@winse.microsoft.com</a>&gt;).</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">Regards</span></p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>They&nbsp;couldn't add that "winse" thing&nbsp;to my "email addresses' list?</p>
<p>Crap, they did -- I just looked.</p>
<p>It is just bouncing anyway.</p>
<p>Le sigh.</p>
<p>I almost lost out on an all expenses paid flight to New Orleans to be an extra in a movie because of this nonsense.</p>
<p>Luckily, Facebook kinda worked, so I got to go. I was even supposed to be paid for that.</p>
<p><em>Though come to think of it, I never got that check -- scale + $25 for costume fitting. Ah well, they probably sent the instructions to that "wrong" email address.</em></p>
<p>Le sigh.</p>
<p>But that guy James? He&nbsp;doesn't work here anymore.</p>
<p>I guess I'll have to start sending email to figure out why people who grab valid email references that used to work think I am no longer employed here.</p>
<hr />
<p>Crap, I wrote the above a few weeks ago, and since then they moved my email to somewhere else.</p>
<p>Again.</p>
<p>For a while only my phone worked.</p>
<p>This is kind of why I haven't been blogging the last few days.</p>
<p>Sorry about that!</p>
<p>I think I need a new server side DELETE ALL inbox rule.</p>
<p>If it's really important, they'll come by, right? :-)</p>

<p><strong>ErikF</strong> on 22 Jul 2012 3:18 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>It is a shame that they can&#39;t make aliases to your previous account names so that your e-mail follows you around. At least that way your address wouldn&#39;t suffer from link rot!</p>
</div>
<p><strong>cheong00</strong> on 22 Jul 2012 7:22 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>@ErikF: I think they probably did (as Michael already checked), just forgotten to update the corresponding DNS MX record / port forwarding / smarthost setting of winse.microsoft.com to point to the new server. If any of the above went wrong, the email will got bounced.</p>

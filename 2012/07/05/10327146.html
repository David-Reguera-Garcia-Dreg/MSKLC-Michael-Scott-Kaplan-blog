<h1>LOAD_LIBRARY_AS_DATAFILE intends to be an underachiever</h1>

<p>The recent question reminded me of something:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">Hi,&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">We recently switched over to using LOAD_LIBRARY_AS_DATAFILE for our INTL dlls, which excludes the DLL from the list of loaded modules.</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">We tend to get a lot of Watson crashes of mismatched intl dll testing. Without having the intl DLLs in the list of modules, we can't tell the version anymore.</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">Is there a workaround other than manually loading the version and sticking it in some global?</span></em></p>
<p>It reminded me of how when you linked to unicows.lib to load/use the <strong>Microsoft Layer for Unicode</strong>, you'd suddenly "lose" all of your Unicode exports in the binary's official export table!</p>
<p>Kind of a required feature of the MSLU loader, that -- to redirect all those Unicode calls! :-)</p>
<p>In this case, <strong>LOAD_LIBRARY_AS_DATAFILE</strong> really is working as designed.</p>
<p>One of the features of it is lower overhead, which includes both not running init code, and not showing up in the loaded dependent modules.</p>
<p>If you need that info, you either have to back out the change, or load all of the information yourself.</p>
<p><em>Other solutions such as loading them the okld way under debug won't help if you want to look at Watson crashes, since&nbsp;customers will seldomly be using a debug build of your product!</em></p>
<p>Since you are loading the DLL as a datafile to get it's string resources, you can definitely load up the version info.</p>
<p>You can even write code to detect problems or even fix them -- and even find bugs earlier! :-)</p>

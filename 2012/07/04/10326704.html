<h1>Michael's window office -- Take 4! (aka Size Matters!)</h1>

<p>I once again am in a window office.</p>
<p>For the fourth time, in fact.</p>
<p>The first time was in Building 1.</p>
<p>Window #1.</p>
<p>It was early 1997.</p>
<p>I was a vendor (v-michka).</p>
<p>The window was one of those weird accidents where the admin had no place to put me.</p>
<p>So she put me in a big corner window office no one was using.</p>
<p>No one cared, and I had meetings with people all the time.</p>
<p>For three weeks, that was where I sat.</p>
<p>Until someone put my name on the door with crayons and construction paper.</p>
<p>Later that same day I was moved into the "Access Insiders" office, a small closet sized&nbsp;inside space....</p>
<p><em>It was unheard of for vendors to have window offices!</em></p>
<p>Nick Shulman taught me back then about stuff like how easy it is to compare office sizes by counting ceiling tiles.</p>
<p>He was concerned about the diagonal offices and how hard it was to compare them to the ones that weren't diagonals (my fancy window office was one of those).</p>
<p>I pointed out that trigonometry wasn't <strong><em>that</em></strong> long ago. :-)</p>
<p>Anyhow, for many years after that, I was put in various non-window offices.</p>
<p>I started working at Microsoft full time in the end of August, 2002.</p>
<p>Obviously vendor time didn't count, so the seniority clock starts on <strong>August 26, 2002</strong>.</p>
<p>Several years later, when I was working as a Technical Lead in International Fundamentals, I was once again assigned a window office -- in Building 24.</p>
<p>Window #2.</p>
<p>It had been an admin's office before, right next to a corner office that a General Manager was in back when the admin had been there.</p>
<p>Soon after that, the whole group got moved to Building 9.</p>
<p>I still had&nbsp;enough seniority on my team that I got a window office.</p>
<p>Window #3.</p>
<p>Then I became a Program Manager on the World Readiness team.</p>
<p>At least one of the reasons (that I wouldn't have to move again!) was shot down because on the new team, my seniority was not as high as others.</p>
<p>So I lost the window.</p>
<p>And we moved to 26N, and I had no window there, either.</p>
<p>Until the other day.</p>
<p>When our admin told me that I was next in line for a window, and we had one.</p>
<p>I was quite used to my old office, for what it's worth.</p>
<p>It was not on "the map" that the various signs in the building used to point to&nbsp;where offices were.</p>
<p><em>It made a meeting in my office into&nbsp;a little intelligence test, to see if people could find me without explicit directions!</em></p>
<p>Anyhow...</p>
<p>Window #4.</p>
<p>The new window office wasn't as wide.</p>
<p>Four and a half tiles across, rather than five.</p>
<p>Sounds silly, but that half a tile makes a big difference with the iBot, and moving up into Balance mode (on two wheels).</p>
<p>I'm basically in now, but I miss that extra half a tile.</p>
<p>I hate to be such a clich&eacute; thinking "size matters", but sometimes it really does....</p>
<p>Anyhow, I have a window again.</p>
<p>Just a few months shy of my tenth anniversary.</p>
<p>We'll see how it long it lasts this time.</p>
<p><em>Maybe until the iBot shaped hole is accidentally&nbsp;created in the wall behind me? :-)</em></p>

During my first Microsoft employment I once put a decent sized hole in a wall while moving a lateral file cabinet. I put in a request for maintenance to fix the hole explaining how it happened, cc&#39;d my boss and life went on, the hole was fixed.</p>
<p>People can always use an intelligence test, kinda like sending a new hire to building seven. They sent you there right?</p>

<p>The question asked by someone internally was:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: terminal,monaco; font-size: medium;">Are East Asian script languages considered to be complex script languages?</span></p>
<p>Well, I suppose it would depend on both one's definition of "East Asian script languages" and "complex script languages", really.</p>
<p>If I use the Microsoft definition of <strong>Complex</strong> then I am only thinking of ones that require special handling when rendered by Uniscribe.</p>
<p>And if I use the general Microsoft definition of <strong>East Asian</strong> to not include <strong>South Asian</strong> or <strong>Southeast Asian</strong>, then I cannot say&nbsp;<strong>YES</strong> on the basis of Thai or Vietnamese.</p>
<p>However, one has to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Uyghur</li>
<li>Traditional Mongolian</li>
<li>Old Hangul</li>
</ul>
<p>and then say that the answer is<strong> YES</strong> unless you plan to rephrase your question. :-)</p>
<p>Usually people asking the question will rephrase at that point, as they were often thinking only on CJK (Chinese/Japanese/Korean) when they asked, but I remind them of <strong>old Hangul</strong>, which is obviously quite Korean. And even while a Korean colleague noted it wasn't a mainstream scenario, it was also noted to be something even high school kids knew about and knew.</p>
<p>So the answer is still <strong>YES</strong> unless the question is reframed yet again!</p>

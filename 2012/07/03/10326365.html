<p>It way way back in 2008 that I&nbsp;blogged <strong><a title="Please Look before you Leap a second" href="../../../2008/05/03/8451692.html">Please Look before you Leap a second</a></strong>.</p>
<p>The proposal to abolish leap seconds didn't really succeed, by the way.</p>
<p>But that isn't what today's blog is about.</p>
<p>It's something that happened on June 30th.</p>
<p>It was described in <a title="Leap second bug cripples Linux servers at airlines, Reddit, LinkedIn (Not a good time to be Australian)" href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/07/02/leap_second_crashes_airlines/">Leap second bug cripples Linux servers at airlines, Reddit, LinkedIn (Not a good time to be Australian)</a>.</p>
<p>Ugh.</p>
<p>From the article:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">A spokesperson for Amadeus confirmed to The Reg today that the outage had been caused by a bug in the kernel of the open-source Linux operating system, and the flaw was triggered by the leap-second change on Saturday night. He said the problem has been sidestepped using a workaround within an hour, but Amadeus is investigating how to avoid and detect similar bugs in advance.</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">Servers run by Mozilla, StumbleUpon, Yelp, FourSquare, Reddit and LinkedIn were also reported to have been hit by the same bug. Mozilla said its implementation of the Java-based Hadoop data processing framework and ElasticSearch weren&rsquo;t working properly on Saturday evening.</span></em></p>
<p>Leap seconds aren't a completely new concept, so I am having my trouble getting my head around a bug that could cause so many different components and servers and sites to have trouble.</p>
<p>Perhaps somebody familiar with the issue can enlighten me on this point.</p>
<p>None of my Vista, Server 2008, Windows 7, Server 2008 R2, or Windows 8 machines had problems during that period, for what it's worth....</p>
<p>Is this a new service in the Linux kernel? Or a bug in an existing service?</p>
<p>I'm really not familiar enough with Linux to know how one goes about making kernel changes -- does someone have the bug assigned to them to fix this?</p>
<p>Who owns the issue?</p>
<hr/><p><strong>metathinker</strong> on 3 Jul 2012 7:28 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>It was a bug in the kernel&#39;s real-time clock code to update the system time for a leap second adjustment - the code forgot to call the function to signal an RTC change. Because the kernel&#39;s (high-resolution) timers are partially dependent on the system time, this caused all of them to expire one second early. Then, they were reset by or on behalf of their user-space clients, so they expired again, and again, and again, for quite a while - causing a sudden CPU load spike on the affected machines.</p>

<p>And the leap year concept is even older. But still...</p>

<p>Yes, they have tested the leap second thing -- that&#39;s why they fixed a deadlock issue long ago. The new issue is just high cpu usage which is harder to notice.</p></div>

<p>Today is my birthday.</p>
<p>i don't particularly care for my birthday,&nbsp;and I'll not be celebrating it or anything....</p>
<p>Something much cooler happened yesterday.</p>
<p>Today's blog is gonna focus on that!</p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large;"><strong>Unicode 6.2 was released!</strong></span></p>
<p>{cue gratuitous graphic}</p>
<p><a href="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/6332.U_2B00_20ba.png"><img style="max-width: 550px;" title="Lira!" border="0" alt="Lira!" src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/6332.U_2B00_20ba.png" /></a></p>
<p>From the official <a title="Announcing The Unicode Standard, Version 6.2" href="../../../../../../blog.unicode.org/2012/09/announcing-unicode-standard-version-62.html">Announcing The Unicode Standard, Version 6.2</a> announcement:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Version 6.2 of the Unicode Standard is now available. This version adds only a single character, the newly adopted Turkish Lira sign; however, the properties and behaviors for many other characters have been adjusted. Emoji and pictographic symbols now have significantly improved line-breaking, word-breaking and grapheme cluster behaviors. The script categorizations for some characters are improved and better documented.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">The Unicode Collation Algorithm has been greatly enhanced for Version 6.2, with a major overhaul of its documentation. There have also been significant changes to the collation weight tables, including improved handling of tertiary weights for characters with decompositions, and changed weights for some pictographic symbols.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">The newly encoded Turkish Lira sign, like other currency symbols, is expected to be heavily used in its target environment. The Unicode Consortium accelerated the release of Unicode 6.2, to accommodate the urgent need for this character.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">For more details of this release, see <a href="http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.2.0/">http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.2.0/</a>.</span></p>
<p>Now I have talked about this character before,in blogs like <strong><a title="Not the Lira or the New Lira, but a New Turkish Lira, nevertheless" href="../../03/14/10282633.html">Not the Lira or the New Lira, but a New Turkish Lira, nevertheless</a></strong> on March 14th of this year, and <strong><a title="Every character has a story #39: U+20ba, aka TURKISH LIRA SIGN (coming soon to Turkey near you!)" href="../../05/09/10302596.html">Every character has a story #39: U+20ba, aka TURKISH LIRA SIGN (coming soon to Turkey near you!)</a></strong> less than two months later.</p>
<p>And it is now in Unicode.</p>
<p>It will be in Windows Phone 8!</p>
<p>It is also in Windows 8!</p>
<p>You can see it in Regional Options:</p>
<p><a href="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/3302.intlcpl01.jpg"><img style="max-width: 550px;" title="Windows 8 Regional Options, Turkish style!" border="0" alt="Windows 8 Regional Options, Turkish style!" src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/3302.intlcpl01.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>You can see it right here in Segoe UI in <strong>Character Map</strong>:</p>
<p><a href="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/6237.charmap02.jpg"><img style="max-width: 550px;" title="Undefined Lira?" border="0" alt="Undefined Lira?" src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/6237.charmap02.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>You'll note it is undefined...</p>
<p>Well, perhaps this one bit of UI not being updated when everything else (collation, properties, locale data, character properties) has been updated is not really such a big deal.</p>
<p>I mean, the same thing happened with Windows 7 and the Rupee after the update:</p>
<p><a href="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/7522.charmap03.jpg"><img style="max-width: 550px;" title="Undefined Rupee?" border="0" alt="Undefined Rupee?" src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/7522.charmap03.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>which was added for Windows 8:</p>
<p><a href="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/3302.charmap04.jpg"><img style="max-width: 550px;" title="Defined Rupee!" border="0" alt="Defined Rupee!" src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/3302.charmap04.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Soon after Windows 8 reaches general availability, they'll so something about the down-level and other product&nbsp;world, too (more on this when I have more to share!).</p>
<p>A lot of this will be coming up in my <strong>Show&nbsp;Me the Money!</strong>&nbsp;talk at the 36th Internationalization and Unicode conference on October 24th in Santa Clara that I talked about previously, <strong><a title="Can you hear me now? How about on August 6th or September 20th or October 24th?" href="../../06/27/10324329.html">here</a></strong>.</p>
<p>For Unicode version, this update expands my previous <strong><a title="The oft-repeated 'What version of Unicode do we/will me support?' question, Redux" href="../../02/06/10264279.html">The oft-repeated 'What version of Unicode do we/will me support?' question, Redux</a></strong> where I said last February in the blog and in comments:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">There is obviously time prior to ship yet after Unicode 6.1 was released that in theory might change that story slightly, though given the complexity of doing more work, I suspect that Windows 8 will largely be centered on 6.0, not 6.1.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">Some specifics:</span></p>
<ul style="padding-left: 30px;">
<li><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">NLS default collation supports all BMP characters defined in Unicode 6.0. Locale-specific collation for East Asian locales supports all EA characters in Unicode 6.0, including CJK Extensions C and D.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">NLS case mapping functions are updated with default case mappings for all characters in Unicode 6.0.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">IDN support functions are updated for all characters in Unicode 6.0 (and, also, for IDNA 2008 + UTS#46)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;"></span><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">Line-breaking behaviour in GDI/Uniscribe and DirectWrite are updated with character data for all Unicode 6.0 characters.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;There are a few 6.1 characters that leaked into Windows 8 into fonts and keyboards.</p>
<p>But that is a topic for another day.</p>
<p>In another blog!</p>

<p><strong>cheong00</strong> on 27 Sep 2012 8:12 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>First, I want to wish you a happy birthday. :)</p>
<p>And I&#39;m curious that, maybe we have to wait a SP to get Unicode 6.2 supoort?</p>
<p>Will the GA version manage to have this built in?</p>

<p><strong>Maximilian Haru Raditya</strong> on 30 Sep 2012 1:47 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>&gt; Soon after Windows 8 reaches general availability, they&#39;ll *so* something about the down-level and other product world...</p>
<p>Perhaps it&#39;s &quot;... they&#39;ll *do* something ...&quot;</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 30 Sep 2012 1:15 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Yes, *do* something....</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Dylan</strong> on 4 Oct 2012 11:19 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Well I&#39;m glad the character got added but that is not a good codepoint for it. &nbsp;Calibri has a typo such that U+02BA, MODIFIER LETTER DOUBLE PRIME, is encoded as U+20BA. &nbsp;So now, while a few programs render U+20BA as an unknown glyph, most of them on my system grab the Calibri symbol and render it like a quotation mark.</p>
<p>U+20BA: ₺</p>
<p>U+02BA: ʺ</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 4 Oct 2012 4:38 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>I don&#39;t know what kind of machine you are on, or what font version, but I don&#39;t see this problem with Calibri....</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Doug Ewell</strong> on 8 Oct 2012 2:23 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>@Dylan: Son of a gun, I do see the Calibri problem. Version 5.62 running on Win 7 64-bit. U+02BA is a .notdef while U+20BA is the double prime.</p>
<p>But that doesn&#39;t make U+20BA &quot;not a good codepoint&quot; for a new currency symbol. It highlights a font bug that would have been less noticeable otherwise, but that isn&#39;t Unicode&#39;s fault.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Ottmar Freudenberger</strong> on 9 Oct 2012 2:59 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>That&#39;s related to KB2739286 for Windows 7, relased today via Download Center, true? Since the relating MSKB article isn&#39;t available yet, looking into the contained update files I came to that conclusion. Does the update replace the &quot;Rupie&quot; update KB2496898? ;-)</p>
<p>Bye,</p>

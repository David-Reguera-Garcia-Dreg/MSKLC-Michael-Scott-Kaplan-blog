<h1>Moving sucks, something it has in common with my new mail slot. And my new office.</h1>

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Completely off-topic, and unworthy.</em></span></p>
<p>It took me a while to decide.</p>
<p>You know, whether or not I liked the new office.</p>
<p>The window office, I mean.</p>
<p>You know that office I mentioned in <strong><a title="Michael's window office -- Take 4! (aka Size Matters!)" href="../../07/04/10326704.html">Michael's window office -- Take 4! (aka Size Matters!)</a></strong>.</p>
<p>First, there is the fact that I hate moving.</p>
<p>I. HATE. MOVING.</p>
<p><strong>Foul tip</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: x-large;">STRIKE 1!!!</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, to be fair, they did one of those special moves.</p>
<p>The ones they do for gimps in wheelchairs.</p>
<p>Where they'lll move all the stuff they usually won't move.</p>
<p>Anyway, where was I?</p>
<p>Oh yeah. Then there is the fact that the new office is smaller.</p>
<p>Half a ceiling tile narrower.</p>
<p>I've almost hit the wall a few times.</p>
<p>Let's call it s <strong>foul tip </strong>again.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large;"><strong>STRIKE 2!!!</strong></span></p>
<p>Then, the other day,&nbsp;I went to my mail slot.</p>
<p>I never check that thing often enough, you know.</p>
<p>And then, I saw it.</p>
<p>The new office means a new mail slot.</p>
<p>For reasons that surpass understanding, they order the mail slots <strong>by office number</strong>!</p>
<p><em>Talk about misuse of collation!</em></p>
<p>It makes no sense.</p>
<p>I mean, the mail room puts a sticker on everything that they deliver.</p>
<p>The sticker has two things on it.</p>
<p>The NAME.</p>
<p>And the OFFICE NUMBER.</p>
<p>Duh.</p>
<p>How hard would it be to make it alphabetical?</p>
<p>I can't find it.</p>
<p>Of course I don't remember the new number, I realize.</p>
<p>Then, I find it.</p>
<p>Sort of.</p>
<p>It is located on the very top shelf.</p>
<p>Even fully extended in the iBOT, I can't reach it.</p>
<p>My mail slot has a bunch of stuff in it, I can see from where I am there is stuff in there.</p>
<p>And I can't reach it.</p>
<p>Crap.</p>
<p>I look over at the mail slot of my old office.</p>
<p>I can reach it easily.</p>
<p>And now I <strong>really</strong> miss my old office.</p>
<p>It is even legal to locate a mail slot in an inaccessible location when you have self identified as being a gimp in a wheelchair?</p>
<p>Seriously.</p>
<p>I guess they couldn't have known, right?</p>
<p><em>I think they will know quite soon, though! Just a hunch. :-)</em></p>
<p>Okay, another <strong>foul tip</strong>.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large;">Still STRIKE 2!!!</span></p>
<p>At least I'm getting a piece of it</p>
<p>Looking at the slots, I see no reasonable way to move it, even if I could reach it.</p>
<p>Which I can't do anyway.</p>
<p>Dammit.</p>
<p>Robbie helped me get the mail, and she is going to call them about moving the mail slots.</p>
<p>I have promised to not rip down ten slots&nbsp;I can reach, although as a form of catharsis, it might actually have helped.</p>
<p>But it's official.</p>
<p>Moving sucks....</p>
<p>Something it has in common with my new mail slot.</p>
<p>And my new office.</p>
<p>I quit.</p>
<p>Sigh.</p>
<p>Ok, I won't quit.</p>
<p>It will be better tomorrow, I'm sure.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>But I'll still wish&nbsp;I hadn't moved....</p>

Yeah, yeah, physics, structural integrity, cost... I&#39;m still waiting for someone to take the &quot;all edge brownie pan&quot; concept and apply it to a building - everyone gets a window that sees outside, even if it&#39;s just a lawnmower-wide gap through the outside into the next office.</p>

<p><strong>John Cowan</strong> on 26 Sep 2012 9:43 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Long ago and with another employer, I had been promised that the partial wall between my cube and the empty cube next to mine would be removed so that I&#39;d have a double-size cube. &nbsp;I waited. &nbsp;And waited. &nbsp;And ... waited.</p>
<p>Finally, I took matters into my own hands and demolished the wall. &nbsp;With my own hands. &nbsp;It wasn&#39;t as hard as you might think, but it wasn&#39;t as easy as I had thought either.</p>
<p>My boss said, &quot;I won&#39;t do anything, just so you understand that the little bit of wall that&#39;s left will stay there permanently.&quot; &nbsp;Not being too fussed about the aesthetics (it&#39;s a cube, for heaven&#39;s sake, not a work of art), I agreed.</p>
<p>I estimate that over my 30-year career, which spans only six employers, I have moved office at least 20 times.</p>
<p>Nick: Hotels are built like that: they may look bulky from the outside, but from a satellite view they are skinny snakes, so that each room can have windows. &nbsp;There&#39;s really no reason that (outside Manhattan and other very crowded cities) offices can&#39;t be built the same way, except management paranoia (which also accounts for the obnoxious open-office plan).</p>

<p>Today's regular blog is being preempted by something fellow Softie David Monk passed to me&nbsp;via Facebook.</p>
<p>Great guy, om time to time and I've worked on stuff in Windows frwith his wife (Stephanie).</p>
<p>Both cool people, very professional. :-)</p>
<p>Anyway, he forwarded me this article:</p>
<p><a href="https://consumerist.com/2012/09/05/mcdonalds-learns-it-shouldnt-trust-free-web-translators-when-it-comes-to-its-billboards/">McDonald&rsquo;s Learns It Shouldn&rsquo;t Trust Free Web Translators When It Comes To Its Billboards</a></p>
<p>Yup, that's a lesson we all should just know, right?</p>
<p>It is not the same kind of problem (or as dangerous!)&nbsp;as the problems I&nbsp;blogged&nbsp;about in <strong><a title="Inaccurate localization can cause problems" href="../../../2006/01/17/513418.html">Inaccurate localization can cause problems</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Perhaps a little more like the problem we had in the Portuguese Vista beta I blogged about in <strong><a title="Inaccurate localization can make you bust out laughing" href="../../../2006/09/22/765506.html">Inaccurate localization can make you bust out laughing</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Though since we never shipped that one and thus were never <em>too</em> embarrassed, perhaps <strong><a title="We're back and we're embarrassing ourselves? (aka Making your localizer's life easier, Part 2)" href="../../../2008/02/21/7837478.html">We're back and we're embarrassing ourselves? (aka Making your localizer's life easier, Part 2)</a></strong> is closer.</p>
<p>Though that was just embarrassing for <em>us</em> -- it wasn't really offending people like the way McDonald's felt the need to reach out to the Hmong to apologize for.</p>
<p>Just like this other case is embarrassing for a localization company (and the people that asked them ffor a translation!): <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/7702913.stm">E-mail error ends up on road sign</a>. Though that one is still&nbsp;less likely to cause offense.</p>
<p>We really need to create some metrics to help us decipher the relative offense, importance, entertainment, and such.</p>
<p>Now in the original article there were many comments, some of which tried to suss out the thought process (or lack thereof!) of McDonald's here.</p>
<p>I mean, they weren't even paying translators, so I doubt they were training cashiers to speak Hmong!</p>
<p>We have the same issue in LIPs here -- being careful about providing warm and sensitive localized product that will sometimes have to throw one back into English.</p>
<p>Maybe it is enough to make the gesture.</p>
<p><em><strong>Unless you poorly auto-translate it, of course!</strong></em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also wonder why no one tracked down what free website provided the bad text.</p>
<p>If McDonald's is apologizing, the website should too. For providing text that was not resonating&nbsp;<em>with members of the Hmong community who say it wasn't written the way anyone actually speaks in the their language &mdash; apparently the billboards are missing spaces between words and the whole thing is just a garbled mishmash of nonsense that doesn't mean a darn thing</em>.</p>
<p>Though if you look&nbsp;at the article, many Hmong comments were added -- perhaps the bilingual population is significant there. So maybe the gesture will be appreciated, once they get it done properly.... :-)</p>
<hr/><p><strong>Mike Dimmick</strong> on 6 Sep 2012 10:16 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>This post reminded me of the train company poster for the Olympics that was supposed to be in Arabic, but was in fact in gibberish:</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-18911599">www.bbc.co.uk/.../uk-england-london-18911599</a></p>
<p>The company supplier blamed font substitution, but surely Arabic reading direction and character shaping should work whatever font you use? I can&#39;t read Arabic, was the sign simply printed in code point order from left-to-right?</p>

<p><strong>Minos</strong> on 7 Sep 2012 11:03 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>As a St. Paul local, I can verify that there is a significant population of Hmong speakers here. &nbsp;It&#39;s common to see park signs in English, Hmong, and Somali.</p>

<h1>Got Windows 8? The Multilingual App Toolkit is released!</h1>

<p>Sometimes we do stuff that's pretty cool and that people like.</p>
<p>And then without ever explaining why, it goes away.</p>
<p>Like the <strong>Microsoft Application Translator</strong> (from the old GlobalDev), which you pretty much have to look to the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040723051638/http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/tools/mat.mspx">Internet Archive</a> to read&nbsp;about!).</p>
<p>Interesting idea.</p>
<p>But understaffed, without funding and sans exec support, it died before it ever got to be cool. Just a few years after it first started.</p>
<p>It never made it past the closed beta.</p>
<p>And the name of <strong>MAT</strong> was dishonored.</p>
<p>Who would bring it back it's honor?</p>
<p>I guess I gave it away in the title, huh? :-)</p>
<p>Well, remember when I wrote <strong><a title="Got Windows 8? Check out the Multilingual App Toolkit" href="../../03/09/10280309.html">Got Windows 8? Check out the Multilingual App Toolkit</a></strong> about a cool tool in beta?</p>
<p>Well, it has been just over six months, and now</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Multilingual App Toolkit for Visual Studio 2012</strong> has now been officially released!</span></p>
<p>You can get it right <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/hh848309.aspx">here</a> from the Dev Center. :-)</p>
<p>From that page:</p>
<h3 style="padding-left: 60px;">Overview</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Multilingual App Toolkit for Visual Studio 2012 is an extension that enables translation support through tools and guides by focusing on the following areas:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>Integration with Visual Studio IDE</strong> enables you to add and manage translation files to a project solution using standard Visual Studio menus and dialogs.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>Pseudo language engine</strong> gives you &lsquo;in house&rsquo; testing of localized apps by identifying translation issues during development such as hardcoded, concatenated, or truncated strings and other visual issues that arise when working with languages. Pseudo translations are stored in the <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=xliff">localization industry standard XLIFF file format</a> and can be edited just like any other language translation. This gives you granular control over pseudo translation testing.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>Translation file export &amp; import roundtrip</strong> provides you with the ability to send and receive resources in XLIFF files to friends, family, or a translator services for review.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>XLIFF lightweight editor</strong> provides a lightweight localization UI for editing translated strings. Get translation suggestions quickly by using the integrated Microsoft Translator (requires active Internet connection). It also allows you to quickly edit data stored in XLIFF files by adjusting pseudo and/or actual translations.</p>
<h3 style="padding-left: 60px;">System requirements</h3>
<ul style="padding-left: 60px;">
<li><strong>Supported Operating Systems</strong>: Windows 8 32-bit or 64-bit editions</li>
<li><strong>Required Software</strong>: Visual Studio 2012 for Windows 8*</li>
<li><strong>Disk Space Requirements:</strong>10MB (x86), 10MB (x64)</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">*Required only for add-in functionality. The Multilingual App Toolkit also has a standalone editor.</p>
<p>There are already several videos up showing what it can do for you, like</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="The Introduction&amp;nbsp;to Multilingual App Toolkit" href="http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/Introduction-to-the-Multilingual-App-Toolkit">Introduction&nbsp;to Multilingual App Toolkit</a>, starring Jan Nelson, and</li>
<li><a title="Build Multi-language apps using the Multilingual App Toolkit" href="http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/Build-Multi-language-apps-using-the-Multilingual-App-Toolkit">Build Multi-language apps using the Multilingual App Toolkit</a>, starring Cameron Lerum, and</li>

<li>there are more to come!</li>
</ul>
<p>And what's more: they've got staffing.</p>
<p>And funding.</p>
<p>And resources.</p>
<p>And a plan.</p>
<p>And the approval (and dare I say&nbsp;delight?)&nbsp;from our senior leadership.</p>
<p>And they're just getting started!</p>
<p>I think it's fair to say that the honor of <strong>MAT</strong> has been restored....</p>

<p>is there any reason for &quot;Supported Operating Systems: Windows 8 32-bit or 64-bit editions&quot; besides that MS hopes to push sales of Windows 8? I mean, which developer will right now switch to Windows 8 on his development machine?</p>

<p><strong>Sara Thomas</strong> on 21 Sep 2012 9:43 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>@ChristianKaiser - You need to install Windows 8 in order to develop Windows 8 apps. This requirement isn&#39;t unique to using the Multilingual App Toolkit.

<p><strong>Cameron Lerum</strong> on 9 Nov 2012 8:10 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Just a quick note to let folks know that the Multilingual App Toolkit v1.1 has been released. &nbsp;This release improves performance, helps identify discovered resource issues, and provides some nice fit &amp; finish work that did not make it into the v1.0 release. &nbsp;If you like v1.1, you&#39;ll love v1.1 :-)</p>

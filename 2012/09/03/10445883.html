<h1>The so long up trigeminal.com domain is going away...</h1>

<p>I have been thinking about it, and the time has come.</p>
 <p>For a long time I held on to it do to licensing requirements of many old projects.</p>
 <p>But those projects are long gone, and there is no longer a reason for it to stay, except nostalgia. ðŸ˜ž:-(</p>
 <p>The trigeminal.com site will come down by the end of the year.</p>
 <p>Originally, I was going to offer them up to the many kind souls who made them possible, but we're past that now. They have scattered to the four winds and probably don't even remember that tiny little Access, VB, and Jet Red website from all those years ago.</p>
 <p>So if you have any favorite utilities or tools or code from the site, you only have a little bit of time to download it.</p>
 <p>If you want to host them, then you have my permission, with just three conditions:</p>
 <ol>
 <li>Give credit to TSI for the utilities;</li>
 <li>Point back to this very blog so people can find it;</li>
 <li>Accept thanks from me for bringing the TSI dream to others!</li>
 </ol>
 <p>So raise a glass, and remember the glorious old trigeminal.com domain. She served us well since the of 1996...</p>

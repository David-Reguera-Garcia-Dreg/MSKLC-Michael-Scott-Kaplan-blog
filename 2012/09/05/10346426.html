<p>I've had flat tires before in my life.</p>
<p>I guess a lot of people have.</p>
<p>I've changed them myself sometimes.</p>
<p>Once when I was dressed up, chaperoning for an event, one of the high schoolers at the event who chose to not really dress up offered to help me, and I let him.</p>
<p>Other times, I've called AAA and they came and changed it.</p>
<p>Now, in a more iBOT-centric world, not much has changed.</p>
<p>I mean, I go a lot&nbsp;of places.</p>
<p>And put a lot of miles on these tires.</p>
<p>Sometimes&nbsp;a tire goes flat.</p>
<p>Once I called Independence Technology and asked them to come out and fix it.</p>
<p>I never did that again after the first time.</p>
<p><em><strong>Insane instructions caused confusion. Why didn't they say "they are tube tires, just like bicycles?</strong></em></p>
<p>$60 for that call.</p>
<p>I've done them myself a few times, though less as my coordination started getting worse -- the whole multiple sclerosis thing.</p>
<p>More recently, and for at least the last 18 months, I've had the maintenance staff at Archstone Redmond Campus replace the tubes any time I get a flat.</p>
<p>They aren't allowed to accept tips <strong>ever</strong>, but I can load up a Starbucks gift card, give it to the maintenance staff, and ask that whoever did the work get to order first.</p>
<p>I wonder what happens when I move out? Can they still help out a former resident who lived there since 1999?</p>
<p><em>Maybe I can set up time for when one of them is on break!</em></p>
<p>Also, Claudia has two sons -- one 17 and one 14. Maybe I can enlist their help! :-)</p>
<p>Now one thing has changed from the old days.</p>
<p>Flat tires used to stop me, until the spare got put on.</p>
<p>But iBOT tires inevitably&nbsp;find themselves&nbsp;flat on a&nbsp;Friday before a long weekend.</p>
<p>Or&nbsp;a few times when I was out of town.</p>
<p>Every time, I'd rotate them so it wasn't the back wheel, so when I went up on&nbsp;two wheels it wouldn't be the one on the bottom!</p>
<p>And then I'd do whatever, and the only time anyone noticed the flat was when I had all four tires on&nbsp;the ground....</p>
<p>Thus far, I've avoided hurling&nbsp;anything heavy at people who mention</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: xx-large;"><em>Did you know you have a flat tire?</em></span></p>
<p>They say this despite the grimace on my face.</p>
<p>As I sit there, tilted unnaturally, I think they are lucky I have nothing to hurl at that moment!</p>
<p>Although (ignoring those awkward moments) I function well, I <strong>am</strong> a little more tense when I have a flat tire.</p>
<p>Even when no one else realizes it.</p>
<p>I've never felt like a car was a part of me, but the iBOT? It kind of is, really!</p>
<p>So when it is ill, it affects me some, too!</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>No flat tires now, so I'm going to bed. This'll post in the morning....</p>

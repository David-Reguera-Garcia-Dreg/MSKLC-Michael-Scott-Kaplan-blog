<p>The other day, Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Colson asked over on The Unicode List:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Hello<br /><br />At <a href="http://store.artlebedev.com/electronics/optimus-popularis/" target="_blank">http://store.artlebedev.com/electronics/optimus-popularis/</a> I see a <br />price in rubles, 31,500 р, where the currency is written р (Cyrillic r).<br />But that р is displayed as a capital Р (Cyrillic R) with stroke.<br />I&rsquo;ve never been in Russia. That&rsquo;s why I have a few questions:<br />Is that symbol is in everyday use?<br />Is it common?<br />Is it new?<br />Why doesn&rsquo;t Unicode support it yet?<br /><br />Thanks for the answers.<br /><br />JF</p>
<p>Regular readers might recall this website.</p>
<p>Remember the Optimus Prime keyboard? :-)</p>
<p>Anyway, it takes more than someone trying to sell a new standard, right? :-)</p>
<p>Jukka K. Korpela helped make this point and more:</p>

So far, the bank has not <br />exercised this right.<br /><br />The page <a href="http://www.artlebedev.com/mandership/159/" target="_blank">http://www.artlebedev.com/mandership/159/</a> may give a different <br />impression. It also has some images depicting actual use.<br /><br />I guess they just never thought of the possibility of submitting a <br />proposal on adding the symbol to Unicode. Such a proposal would create <br />an interesting situation, especially if it were accompanied with <br />substantial demonstration of actual use.<br /><br /><br />Yucca</p>
<p>It could indeed lead to an even weirder situation where some people with their own agenda submit a proposal which ends up eventually making it into Unicode -- only later on, people who feel (correctly or incorrectly) that their opinions on the matter were not consulted or even recognized.</p>
<p>One could argue this happened for Khmer.</p>
<p>And Tamil.</p>
<p>And Bengali.</p>
<p>And Assamese.</p>
<p>And so on....</p>
<p>Perhaps we should not be so quick to take the new non-sanctioned, nonofficial currency symbol that the government isn't even asking for yet. :-)</p>

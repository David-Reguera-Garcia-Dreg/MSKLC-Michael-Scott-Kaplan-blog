<h1>Not Microsoft nor Mozilla nor Unicode; could the problem be Wikipedia? :-)</h1>

<p>Over in the Suggestion Box, metathinker asked:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>In the Wikipedia page on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mongolian_script&amp;oldid=468646376" rel="nofollow" target="_new">classic Mongolian script</a>), it briefly mentions some problems with using Mongolian on computers.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Among these, it links to Microsoft KB article <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929763" rel="nofollow" target="_new">929763</a>, which details "some problems" with the OpenType layout data for Vista's new font Mongolian Baiti, which (in the KB's own words!) "makes the font almost unusable in Windows Vista."</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I sense a bit of a story there. Perhaps someday you will be ready to tell it, Michael?</em></p>
<p>I'm not sure there's truly a "story" here, but I can tell what I know of it. :-)</p>
<p>The version of the font that shipped in original RTM version of Vista did indeed have the issue:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">The OpenType Layout data of the Mongolian Baiti font is used to display traditional Mongolian text. The OpenType Layout data affects various contextual glyph &nbsp; transformations. This issue occurs because of some problems in the OpenType Layout data in the Mongolian Baiti font file.</p>
<p>However, as the KB article indicates, this weas fixed in version 5.01 of the font.</p>
<p>That version was shipped an update for Vista, an update that was rolled up into SP1.</p>
<p>And that update also shipped with Windows Server 2008.</p>
<p>Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 also both shipped with&nbsp;this update.</p>
<p>So, yes there is a bug here - one that shipped over half a decade ago.</p>
<p>And quickly fixed, as well.</p>
<p>And it stayed fixed in subsequent releases.</p>
<p>The real bug (IMHO) is in a Wikipedia article that focuses that far n the past as proof that Unicode's encoding of Mongolian is buggy. I thought Wikipedia was supposed to not provide bias against Unicode, Microsoft, or Firefox without substantive information about the problem, a problem of which even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolian_script#Issues">the most recent version of the&nbsp;issuses sectin of the page</a>&nbsp;appears&nbsp;to be&nbsp;guilty?</p>
<p>Perhaps Wikipedia could fix that bug, and help describe the actual issues! :-)</p>

<p>Anyway, thanks kindly, Michael!</p>

<p><strong>cheong00</strong> on 12 Jun 2012 8:36 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Agreed Michael could have edited with Wiki article to reflect the fix. In fact Wikipedia&#39;s policy welcome subject matter experts to review their articles, so I think adding a patch status update would be appropiate.</p>

<p>Now that we are at the Windows 8 Release Preview, you might figure there are no surprises left on the locale front.</p>
<p>And no one would blame you for thinking this; it is an entirely reasonable supposition!</p>
<p>But looking back to zn earlier part of the series -- part 14 -- you may know where we are going here...</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: xx-large;">Behold tzm-Tfng-MA!</span></strong></p>
<p>a.k.a. Central Atlas Tamazight (Tifinagh, Morocco):</p>
<p><a href="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/8461.tamazight01.jpg"><img title="tzm-Tfng-MA in Regional Options" border="0" alt="tzm-Tfng-MA in Regional Options" src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/8461.tamazight01.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>And now, we have a ballgame!</p>
<p>Try it out, let me know what you think....</p>
<p>New locale, new script, new keyboards -- new everything! Not even running on my "pseudo-enhanced-pre-Cherokee" view&nbsp;can dampen my positive feelings here -- that's Tamazight using the Tifinagh script!</p>
<p>I think this is pretty exciting, don't you? :-)</p>

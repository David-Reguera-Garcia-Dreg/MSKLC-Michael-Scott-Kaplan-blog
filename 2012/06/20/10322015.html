<p>The separator.</p>
<p>Whether it is something you think of as <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd373852">LOCALE_SLIST</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;"><em>Character(s) used to separate list items, for example, a comma is used in many locales. The maximum number of characters allowed for this string is four, including a terminating null character.</em></span></p>
<p>or <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.globalization.textinfo.listseparator.aspx">System.Globalizaton.TextInfo.ListSeparator</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">Gets or sets the string that separates items in a list.</span></em></span></p>
<p>the principle is the same.</p>
<p>Now theory is fine and dandy.</p>
<p>Like all that "The maximum number of characters allowed for this string is four, including a terminating null character" nonsense.</p>
<p>The limit info? That's pretty much just for users. Oh, and also in pseudo where&nbsp;it is two characters long&nbsp;-- as mentioned in <strong><a title="Seeing double? You're not drunk; you're just running pseudo! (aka Announcement: Pseudo Day!)" href="../../../2010/03/02/9971296.html">Seeing double? You're not drunk; you're just running pseudo! (aka Announcement: Pseudo Day!)</a></strong>.</p>
<p><em>I also previously mentioned ListSeparator in&nbsp;<a title="'Managing' [List] Separator Anxiety" href="../../../2006/10/26/874646.html">'Managing' [List] Separator Anxiety</a>., but that was just to point out an unrelated bug.</em></p>
<p>But then there is the problem many people have noticed for years, and which someone asked me yesterday:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">Why does the CultureInfo.CurrentCulture.TextInfo.ListSeparator property return ","?&nbsp; I would expect it to return ",&nbsp;"&nbsp; (I.e. comma and whitespace).&nbsp; When composing lists in the English language comma is by convention always followed by whitespace.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">For example "Planes, Trains and Automobiles" rather than "Planes,Trains and Automobiles", even outlook&rsquo;s grammar checker complains</span></p>
<p>Now it may be true that Word doesn't like it, but Excel tends to choke any time these "usually single character" locale properties are more than one character.</p>
<p>So I guess you could say we didn't think of it until after it would break Excel!</p>
<p><em>Not to mention other rules -- like whether a comma goes before the "and", after the penultimate item!</em></p>
<p>Regular readers likely know how much I'd like to stick it Word for its "helpful" text shortcuts that break so many keyboards layouts and remain the single&nbsp;most common customer complaint about MSKLC.</p>
<p><em>Can one thwack people from&nbsp;one's own company's paid products just because it is such a common source of problems for&nbsp;one's free ones? Would that be an SBC violation, or an HR issue? :-)</em></p>
<p>But can we really hurt Excel just because it is one of the main clients of the LOCALE_SLIST, even if its usage handcuffs us from making the locale data more useful? :Probably&nbsp;not.</p>
<p>Though if it were up to me, I'd make both Word and Excel to better here.</p>
<p>I'd make them fix their bugs. :-)</p>

<p>Penultimate is next-to-last, or &quot;Trains&quot; in this example. Did you mean &quot;ultimate,&quot; or simply &quot;last&quot;?</p>

<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 20 Jun 2012 3:57 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>I means &quot;Trains&quot;, like &quot;Planes, Trains and Automobiles&quot; vs. &quot;Planes, Trains, and Automobiles&quot;....</p>

<h1>Have you started looking at the Windows 8 Release Preview yet?</h1>

<p>You may have been asleep all day yesterday after some party.</p>
<p>Or maybe you were in bed, sick from the flu.</p>
<p>Either way, my point is you might have missed the news mentioned all over and covered in the Building Windows 8 blog: <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2012/05/31/delivering-the-windows-8-release-preview.aspx">Delivering the Windows 8 Release Preview</a>.</p>
<p>The Release Preview is available in <strong><span style="font-size: x-large;">14</span></strong> languages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arabic</li>
<li>English</li>
<li>Chinese (Simplified)</li>
<li>Chinese (Traditional)</li>
<li>French</li>
<li>German</li>
<li>Japanese</li>
<li>Korean</li>
<li>Portuguese (Brazil)</li>
<li>Russian</li>
<li>Spanish</li>
<li>Swedish</li>
<li>Turkish</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I cribbed the list from the <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/faq">Windows 8 Release Preview: Frequently asked questions</a>, which also had a little more info about the languages:</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">The Windows 8 Release Preview Setup program will automatically detect your current language selection. If you don't have one of these languages selected, you can choose the language you want to download.</span></em></span></p>
<p>Good info!</p>
<p>Now as in the <strong>Developer Preview</strong> and the <strong>Consumer Preview</strong> before, you may see some blogs from me here covering exciting new features now available to you in the <strong>Release Preview</strong>.</p>
<p>Feel free to ask me here if you try the <strong>Release Preview</strong> and have a question about some feature you just noticed.</p>
<p>There are a lot of things I'm pretty excited about, and I can't wait to talk about them here!</p>

But one of the bigger surprises is that the new default font for Tamil uses an old variant of the script (AI/AA ligatures), is this intentional?</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Tom Gewecke</strong> on 1 Jun 2012 8:58 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Is Windows 8 switchable among those localizations or do you need to download a separate copy for each one</p>
</div>
<p><strong>contextfree</strong> on 2 Jun 2012 3:40 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>One thing I noticed is that the RP appears to use ligatures in UI display text - it&#39;s pretty nice. I don&#39;t think this was in CP and in fact I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve ever seen this in any OS before.</p>

<p><strong>Cristian</strong> on 3 Jun 2012 8:13 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Windows 8 Release Preview still has the same broken fonts for Romanian as Windows 7 (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://goo.gl/yAyTK">http://goo.gl/yAyTK</a>). Please, pretty please, pretty please with sugar on top, fix them!</p>

<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 3 Jun 2012 11:56 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Which fonts do you mean, Christian? Be specific!</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 3 Jun 2012 11:58 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Tom: Language Packs and Language Interface Packs are both downloadable, but they will be by the same mechanisms so installing them will work the same way (instead of two different ways)....</p></div>
<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 3 Jun 2012 1:49 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Jan, that&#39;s a very good question, I&#39;m going to have to ask some people....</p>
</div>
<p><strong>C. Siedjan</strong> on 5 Jun 2012 11:27 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Any new script supported in this release? When will Microsoft update its Uniscribe engine to supports scripts of Indonesia (Balinese, Javanese, Sundanese, Batak, Rejang, and Buginese)? All of them are Brahmic abugida scripts that require glyph reordering.</p>

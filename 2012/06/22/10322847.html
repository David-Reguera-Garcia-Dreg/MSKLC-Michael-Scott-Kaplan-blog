<h1>HOW TO: [fearlessly] illegally discriminate against the handicapped (aka It Is The Worst Of Times...)</h1>

<p>Yesterday in <strong><a title="Court stomps on NetFlix's disability argument (aka It Is The Best Of Times...)" href="../21/10322443.html">Court stomps on NetFlix's disability argument (aka It Is The Best Of Times...)</a></strong>, I talked about a great precedent that win or lose seems poised to impact how we look at the the <strong>Americans with Disabilities Act</strong> in the future.</p>
<p>Despite these steps that give me hope, I have to admit that we aren't fully there yet.</p>
<p>I mean, there are the problems I had renewing my driver's license that I described in <strong><a title="It seems that discrimination is the official policy at the WA Dept. of Licensing" href="../../../2006/11/14/1074214.html">It seems that discrimination is the official policy at the WA Dept. of Licensing</a></strong>.</p>
<p>And then more recently there were my problems in New Mexico I described in <strong><a title="Albuquerque is not so accessible to the likes of me...." href="../../05/01/10299370.html">Albuquerque is not so accessible to the likes of me....</a></strong></p>
<p>More recently, Claudia and I had a wonderful visit to Cherokee, NC to visit the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Band_of_Cherokee_Indians">Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians</a>, which actually went very well, though getting from a&nbsp;"civilized" airport to the Reservation&nbsp;did require the help of a Microsoft VP's talented Executive Assistant, a bunch of money, and a lot of travel time.</p>
<p>Though for the record let me say that after I was on the Reservation, <a href="http://www.cherokeetransit.com/">Cherokee Transit</a> was able to get me to every place we wanted to go, no matter how high into the hills and no matter how many switchbacks -- and it was just $1 a trip. And incredibly friendly people, too!</p>
<p>Next time I'm there, I will outsmart them though, and buy an unlimited monthly pass. They deserve to be compensated for how much easier they made my time in Cherokee, NC. :-)</p>
<p><em>I'll likely talk more about the EBCI trip in a future blog, beyond the transit system; it was a truly amazing time!</em></p>
<p>Okay, so perhaps this blog today might almost have ended on a high note.</p>
<p>Except for one or two&nbsp;things.</p>
<p>Like the fact that the upcoming Seattle <a href="http://www.punkrockfleamarketseattle.com/">Punk Rock Flea Market</a> at the Belltown Underground Events Center isn't wheelchair accessible.</p>
<p>Bummer. :-(</p>
<p>And then it gets worse.</p>
<p>My girlfriend has a small surgery set up for next week -- nothing dire and no overnight hospitalization is required. But they do need a responsible person to drop her off and pick her up. To take care of her.</p>
<p>Claudia asked me&nbsp;if I'd do it&nbsp;and I said yes, she put&nbsp;my name&nbsp;down, and no one from the surgeon to any of his staff or schedulers said a negative word about it.</p>
<p>Until they called her the other day to tell her that she had to have another "responsible party".</p>
<p>Due to some kind of "liability issue" for which they can name no legal basis, a non-handicapped person is the only kind of person who can be entrusted for this job.</p>
<p>An issue that never came up until weeks after we were there.</p>
<p>Apparently, even if she and I were married, this discriminatory would still apply.</p>
<p>Grrrrrr.</p>
<p>I'm annoyed.</p>
<p>Claudia is even more annoyed.</p>
<p>Sure, we've lined up our "Shabbas Goy" to meet their silly requirement, but I'm the one she trusts.</p>
<p>If not for the fact that neither one of us wants to distract the surgeon or anyone in his office, we'd probably have a lawyer contact them and insist on the legal&nbsp;basis for this policy. And then sue them for the right to be the one there after they were unable to provide an adequate legal basis.</p>
<p>But alas, there's no upside to fighting them on this.</p>
<p>Once again, I'm a second class citizen, unable to do things that a responsible adult is allowed to do.</p>
<p>And we both get the reminder that as a country have&nbsp;a long way to go before the promise of the ADA's protections will apply to major life activities like this one.</p>

<p>The doctor in hospital could just recommand something like that to your girlfriend and both of you wonldn&#39;t be annoyed, as there would be medically trained staff on the minibus who would take care of your girlfriend appropiately.</p>

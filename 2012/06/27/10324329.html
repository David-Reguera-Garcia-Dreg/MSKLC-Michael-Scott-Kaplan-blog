<p>Sometimes people want to hear my voice really bad.</p>
<p>It isn't very often, but it happens. I swear.</p>
<p>I thought I'd mention some planned speaking events in the future, just in case you are one of those people.</p>
<p>In reverse order:</p>
<p><strong>October 24th @ 15:10</strong> in <strong>Santa Clara, California, USA</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.unicodeconference.org/">36th Internationalization and Unicode Conference</a></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Building the Phonetic Keyboard for </strong>Cherokee</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It has been over a decade since any keyboard layout on Windows has raised the roof on what a keyboard can do, but with heavy use of the long-existing and free but never before used feature of chained dead keys, the single most complicated layout ever created for Windows was created, in a specific answer to a customer request ignored on every other platform. This feature opens the door to many other novel and interesting keyboard layouts that future versions may well find themselves taking advantage of!</p>
<p><strong>October 24th @ 09:00</strong> in <strong>Santa Clara, California, USA</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.unicodeconference.org/">36th Internationalization and Unicode Conference</a></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong></strong><strong>Show Me The Money!</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It has always been a rule at Microsoft that locale data is not changed for prior versions or in service packs for the current version. And like all rules, there is one major exception: currency values! I'll be taking you on an exciting journey of the many updates for the Euro, the Indian Rupee, the Turkish Lira, and other times that Microsoft has shown its customers the money....</p>
<p><strong>September 20th somewhere near San Jose, California, USA</strong></p>
<p><strong>A Webcast for <a href="../../../../../../www.imug.org/index.html">IMUG</a></strong>&nbsp;<strong>about something related to Windows 8 internationalization/World-Readiness</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>I'll provide more details when I have some!</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>August 6th</strong> in <strong>Brisbane, Queensland, Australia</strong></p>
<p><strong>2nd MyLanguage Conference (<a href="../../../../../../www.mylanguage.gov.au/conference.html">MyLanguage: Connecting, Collaborating, Creating</a>)</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I will be doing one of the International Keynotes at this conference, and I'll provide more details when they do (it's rude to scoop a conference you are speaking at!)</p>
<p>The rest of the time I'll be somewhere; if you see me you can say hi and hear whatever I say when I'm accosted randomly on the street.</p>
<p>I'm told that too can be entertaining.</p>
<p>I'm currently in search of an original version of the "you have one chance when you meet me and want to&nbsp;say something about the iBOT so you should make sure it's really clever" response.</p>
<p>If you really want to impress me, be ready with something fabulous.Or something cool. :-)</p>

<p>The question came in just the other day:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">I noticed that in some locales the&nbsp;LOCAL_SNATIVEDIGITS have special digits, but the LOCALE_IDIGITSUBSTITUTION isn't set to use them.</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">What's up with that?</span></em></p>
<p>Yeah, we do that sometimes....</p>
<p>Kind of the opposite problem of when we turn digit substitution on them even when we are using U+0030 to U+0039.</p>
<p>I mean, in both cases digit substitution isn't ultimately done.</p>
<p>But either way we don't do useful work!</p>
<p>I don't know, really. I guess it is just kind of nice to have the digits that <strong>may</strong> be used by a locale be queryable....</p>
<p>Even if we don't use them ourselves.</p>
<p>Every once in a while I see an app that substitutes digits for those locales -- it is a great way to find people that do their own digit substitution but skip some of our settings.</p>
<p>Sharp eye noticing the issue, FWIW. :-)</p>

<p>Trust is hard.</p>
<p>And once lost, it is hard to get back.</p>

<p>For me, it wasn't about the raisins.</p>
<p>I hated 'em, and I stopped trusting cookies sometimes. But I never blamed the people who handed them to me.</p>
<p>And I was raised Jewish, so the Santa thing didn't hit me.</p>
<p><a href="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/6204.santa.jpg"><img style="max-width: 550px;" border="0" alt="" src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/6204.santa.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Or the Easter Bunny, for that matter.</p>
<p><a href="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/0363.easterbunny.jpg"><img style="max-width: 550px;" border="0" alt="" src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/0363.easterbunny.jpg" /></a></p>
<p><em>Though I grew up in "Catholic Beachwood", so I witnessed some people who hit those issues....</em></p>
<p>And I always knew the Great Pumpkin was fake.</p>
<p><a href="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/6076.greatpumpkin.jpg"><img style="max-width: 550px;" border="0" alt="" src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/6076.greatpumpkin.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>But the&nbsp;Tooth Fairy debacle?</p>
<p><a href="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/5086.toothfairy2.jpg"><img style="max-width: 550px;" border="0" alt="" src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/5086.toothfairy2.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>That&nbsp;was where the wheels started to come off the wagon, for me.</p>
<p>I recall (after losing a bicuspid that I helped out myself once it was loose) overhearing my parents talk about <strong>who had money tor my tooth</strong>.</p>
<p>Aha!</p>
<p><a href="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/7444.toothfairy.jpg"><img style="max-width: 550px;" border="0" alt="" src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/7444.toothfairy.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>But the bigger problem came before that.</p>
<p>And I didn't even know it....</p>
<p>You see, I wanted to be an astronaut.</p>
<p>I was too young to do much to help my resume then, so I did the one thing I knew I could do at that age.</p>
<p>I drank Tang!</p>
<p><a href="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/7041.tang.gif"><img style="max-width: 550px;" border="0" alt="" src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/7041.tang.gif" /></a></p>
<p>I knew astronauts drank it, so I just would make sure to have it be a part of my training.</p>
<p>Easy.</p>
<p>But then, something unfortunate happened.</p>
<p>I had a coldish kind of thing.</p>
<p>Nothing serious, but I was given Dimetapp.</p>
<p><a href="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/0550.dimetapp.jpg"><img style="max-width: 550px;" border="0" alt="" src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/0550.dimetapp.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>But I had decided I hated Dimetapp.</p>
<p>My mother had a "brilliant" idea.</p>
<p>She saw me snarfing up Tang like it was going out of style.</p>
<p>My astronaut training program had to stay on track, of course.</p>
<p>So she dosed the Tang with Dimetapp.</p>
<p>Well, perhaps you can guess what happened next.</p>
<p>Tang started tasting really nasty.</p>
<p>Not always, but my young detective mind concluded that the problem was <strong>too much Tang</strong>!</p>
<p>I realized my dreams of being an astronaut could never be accomplished.</p>
<p>I mean, I couldn't even pass the Tang test! How was I supposed to do all of the other astronaut things?</p>
<p>Suddenly I hated Tang.</p>
<p>I mean really hated Tang.</p>
<p>It wasn't until years later that I learned about the "Dimetapp Roofie" issue.</p>
<p>And how they ruined my dreams of being in space.</p>
<p>Just ruined them.</p>
<p>And caused trust issues! :-(</p>
<p><em>My other dream, to be a member of The Supremes, also didn't work out. As you probably guessed. But that's a story for another day....</em></p>

<p>Far be it from me to blow the tiles off your roofie, Mr. Kaplan, but you are, indeed &amp; in fact, in space.</p>

<p>I might have been the only software developer in the world&nbsp;who is confused about the world of "Desktop" versus "Metro".</p>
<p>Though I'm inclined to doubt it. :-)</p>
<p>Like when I was asked just the other day:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;"><em>I am looking for an API that converts Unicode to Punycode.&nbsp; I can see that there&rsquo;s already a .NET API just for this, but it&rsquo;s not in Metro.&nbsp; What would it take to make it Metro?</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;My first thought was to point to <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd318149.aspx">IdnToAscii</a>.</p>
<p>A function that claims to be available to both Desktop and Metro apps.</p>
<p>But someone was concerned about this answer:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;"><em>As far as I know, IdnToAscii is only for C++.<br />The&nbsp;question is for C#/VB.</em></span></p>
<p>Okay, here is where things get complicated.</p>
<p>I think I have it straight now, though.</p>
<p>Here are the travails to get there -- imagine each one required several emails to clarify (since each one did!):</p>
<ul>
<li>The Base Class Libraries (BCL) in the .NET Framework that runs on ARM is a subset of the full&nbsp;BCL. (<strong>OH NO!</strong>)</li>
<li>The System.Globalization Namespace is included in that subset (<strong>OH YES!</strong>)</li>
<li>The IdnMapping class is apparently not being included (<strong>OH NO!</strong>)</li>
<li>The IdnToAscii function is available to both the Desktop and Metro apps (<strong>OH YES!</strong>)</li>
<li>If you are using C# or VB, p/invoke cannot be used to run arbitrary code (<strong>OH NO!</strong>)</li>
<li>IdnToAscii is on the white list of legal functions to p/invoke to (<strong>OH YES!</strong>)</li>
</ul>
<p>So really, the fact that you cannot get all of this from a glance at the docs is that the docs are a work in progress.</p>
<p>But I can live with that -- as long as people can get to functionality, they are not blocked.</p>
<p>We can get stuff done!</p>
<p>Whether&nbsp;Desktop or Metro.</p>
<p>Whether Native or Managed.</p>
<p>Whether x86 or x64 or WoA (ARM).</p>
<p>I think I know what my first Modern app will be!</p>

<p>We will not be releasing an ARM build of our product then (need our own native DLL for a few key tasks).</p></div>
<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 18 May 2012 2:45 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Well, you may want to dig in to get the right answer for your code -- my case kind of proves that the answer can be complicated!</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Simon Buchan</strong> on 18 May 2012 8:48 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>My understanding of the entire point of WinRT was that APIs are WinRT apis (applies to &quot;Metro style&quot; applications in the docs), not &quot;C++&quot; or &quot;.NET&quot; apis: basically it&#39;s supposed to extend the language independence of .NET metadata to native code and scripting languages. So any &quot;Metro&quot; API should be accessible from any WinRT supporting language, so I&#39;m more surprised that there&#39;s no .NET binding to it through some static class somewhere. I guess P/Invoke isn&#39;t so horrible, but it could be far better.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Simon Buchan</strong> on 18 May 2012 9:01 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>@Joshua: Cross-language/runtime interop is what WinRT is *for*. Recommendation for portal code is for you to, in your Metro builds, compile your native dll with your exports wrapped with C++/CX definitions:</p>
<p>// foo.h</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>int foo_bar(const char* str);</p>
<p>// WinRT.cpp</p>
<p>#include &quot;foo.h&quot;</p>
<p>namespace MyComponent</p>
<p>{</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;public ref class Foo sealed</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;{</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;public:</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;static int Bar(Platform::String^ str)</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;{</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;// Platform::String^ is pretty close to System.String in .NET.</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;// Convert UTF-16 to UTF-8 here...</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;return foo_bar(utf8Str);</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;}</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;}</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>Then you get a WinRT .dll that&#39;s indistinguishable from any other, including builtins.</p>

<p><strong>Alan McF</strong> on 23 May 2012 12:56 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>@joshua It works for me in a Metro C# app too. &nbsp;When I add various Win32 API P/Invoke calls they work in *most* cases, but running WACK (Windows App Cert Kit) highlights that of the one I used &quot;socket&quot; and etc are forbidden but has no complaints about IdnToAscii.</p>

<p><strong>Pavel Minaev [MSFT]</strong> on 13 Jun 2012 1:24 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>&gt;&gt; If you are using C# or VB, p/invoke cannot be used to run arbitrary code</p>
<p>It cannot be used to run arbitrary code in a sense that you can&#39;t P/Invoke, say, a desktop-only API. But from everything I&#39;ve seen, it can absolutely be used to P/Invoke into the Metro subset of Win32, or your own DLLs. Or did that change in RP?</p>

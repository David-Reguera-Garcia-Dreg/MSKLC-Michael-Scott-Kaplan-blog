<h1>Inaccurate localization can make you forget why you did something!</h1>

<p>Every once in&nbsp;a while, I am reminded of the fact that I've been blogging for a good long while.</p>
<p>Like the other day, when Andrew added me to an email thread, saying:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">+Michael, in case he knows if there are specific reasons why the keyboard name &ldquo;US&rdquo; was marked as not localizable with the exception of Arabic and Hebrew.</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">The United States-International keyboard is named differently in English too, it&rsquo;s not just an issue for localization:</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;"><a href="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/7776.keyboardlist.jpg"><img style="max-width: 550px;" border="0" alt="" src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/7776.keyboardlist.jpg" /></a></span></p>
<p>My first thought: <strong>"how the hell would I know?"</strong></p>
<p>I'm not a localization engineer, after all.</p>
<p>But then thought about it.</p>
<p>And remembered my <strong><a title="Inaccurate localization can make you bust out laughing" href="../../../2006/09/22/765506.html">Inaccurate localization can make you bust out laughing</a></strong> blog from September of 2006.</p>
<p>I then realized that the localization instructions were indeed a step to try to keep a <strong>US --&gt; BR</strong> type situation from happening again!</p>
<p>A slight over-reaction, to be sure. But their hearts were in the right place.</p>
<p>The IPE realized the best fix for the situation:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">Thanks Michael.</span></em><br /><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">So there wasn&rsquo;t really a good reason to put the instruction there, since it was just to ensure that the translators didn&rsquo;t localize US to their country equivalent. I believe we should remove the instruction and have everyone localize US to the translated equivalent of United States, to be consistent with &ldquo;United States-International&rdquo;</span></em></p>
<p>Perhaps the notion that my blog has no wider meaning or usage was&nbsp;knocked a&nbsp;bit over by the email. :-(</p>
<p><a href="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/7674.keyboardlist.jpg"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://blogs.msdn.com/resized-image.ashx/__size/550x0/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-33-81/7674.keyboardlist.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;Ah well, as they say, all's well that ends better!</p>
<p>&nbsp;I suppose being able to recall such issues undermines my claim that I don't know how such things are decided.....</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">And now, on The Unicode List&trade;, we have someone wanting to know the position where INDIAN RUPEE SIGN will be added to the "U.S. English" keyboard. I don't know if he meant specifically Microsoft's, but maybe. The guy is located in Pune. It shows that despite their names, and despite the presence of local keyboards, the "U.S." keyboard layouts are in worldwide use.</span></em></p>
<p>The short answer, unsurprisingly enough to some, is:</p>
<p>Essentially&nbsp;<strong>never</strong>.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large;">Precisely <strong>never</strong>.</span></p>
<p><em>Perhaps expanding it to the long answer would be prudent at this juncture!</em></p>
<p>When the rupee was added to Windows,&nbsp;a new en-IN type keyboard was added as well.</p>
<p>It takes kbdus.dll, and adds INDIAN RUPEE SIGN to ALTGR+4.</p>
<p>The <strong>United States - International</strong> keyboard already has something assigned there:</p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large;">&curren;</span></p>
<p>aka U+00a4, aka CURRENCY SIGN.</p>
<p>And we don't change keyboard layout assignments.</p>
<p>Also, SHIFT + ALTGR + 4 is taken. By</p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large;">&pound;</span></p>
<p>aka U+00a3,aka POUND SIGN.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Note that ALTGR+R is also taken there -- it is</p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large;">&reg;</span></p>
<p>aka U+00ae, aka REGISTERED SIGN.</p>
<p>But by that time, you've left the land of the even theoretically intuitive....</p>

<p>Now we did consider adding it to kbdus.dll, but that idea was rejected -- since adding ALTGR+4 to kbdus.dll would disable the lone "RIGHT ALT" key, causing it to send CTRL+ALT when it was&nbsp;typed in.</p>
<p>Doing that everywhere in the world for the sake of any one country's currency symbol was just deemed a bad idea -- that's where that en-IN keyboard idea came from, the meeting where we realized kbdus.dll was out of bounds....</p>

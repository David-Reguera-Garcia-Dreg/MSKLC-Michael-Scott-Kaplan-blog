<h1>The missing blog Part #10b?</h1>

<p>Over in the Suggestion Box, Joshua Boyce asked:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">I have been reading your series "Getting all you can out of a keyboard layout", and in part 10a (<a href="../../../2006/04/22/581107.html" rel="nofollow" target="_new"><strong><span style="color: #006bad;" color="#006bad">blogs.msdn.com/.../581107.aspx</span></strong></a>) you hint at an upcoming 10b part to the series... Any chance that this series could be expanded to complete coverage of the issues you have described?</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">Thanks.</span></em></p>
<p>Well, Joshua has a point.</p>
<p>Now I wrote <strong><a title="Getting all you can out of a keyboard layout, Part #10a" href="../../../2006/04/22/581107.html">Getting all you can out of a keyboard layout, Part #10a</a></strong> over six years ago, and the follow-up I suggested there has never happened.</p>
<p>And with six years since then, it would be hard to claim I was busy the whole time. :-)</p>
<p>The truth is that I had a hard time sustaining interest in doing it for the sample, given how the suggested improvement wouldn't have much impact for any existing layout.</p>
<p>This made it a theoretical improvement, one that didn't have much real need....</p>
<p>Of course, there has been a change since then!</p>
<p>Last November, in <strong><a title="The evolving Story of Locale Support, part 6: Behind the Cherokee Phonetic layout in Windows 8" href="../../../2011/11/09/10235391.html">The evolving Story of Locale Support, part 6: Behind the Cherokee Phonetic layout in Windows 8</a></strong>, I talked about a new Windows 8 keyboard with just the kind of complexity in it that the change might help.</p>
<p>Suddenly, motivation!</p>
<p>I now have a reason to dust off that sample. And to not take&nbsp;6 years to do so.</p>
<p>Stay tuned....</p>

<h1>Why one may not be able to find a zh-TW MUI language pack, and why that's okay...</h1>

<p>The question seemed simple enough:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Where can I get the Windows 7 SP1 MUI Language Pack for zh-TW? I was only able to find on for zh-HK!</em></p>
<p>The answer is unfortunately not so simple....</p>
<p>I first talked about it in <strong><a title="Yes, Ivo^H^H^HVirginia, there is a zh-HK *and* a zh-TW" href="../../../2010/03/26/9982386.html">Yes, Ivo^H^H^HVirginia, there is a zh-HK *and* a zh-TW</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Where I pointed out that although there is a zh-TW version of Windows 7, there was no MUI Language Pack for zh-TW.</p>
<p>Although some have found RTM files for a zh-TW Language Pack, it was missing a key feature that the zh-TW version of Windows itself&nbsp;has.</p>
<p>In fact, there are only three real differences between zh-TW and zh-HK:</p>
<ul>
<li>The name of the Language Pack itself;</li>
<li>The font differences that the two different locales give based on default system locale, previously described by me in blogs like <strong><a title="Doing it for appearances, Hong Kong style!" href="../../../2011/01/13/10115302.html">Doing it for appearances, Hong Kong style!</a></strong>;</li>
<li>ROC calendar support.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now one could argue that there should&nbsp;be more differences in terms of translation, but there aren't.</p>
<p>And since the zh-TW Language Pack was only doing the first two (one of which doesn't really matter and the other of which can be done via a system locale change), it really wasn't doing anything of consequence.</p>
<p>Plus it was confusing for anyone trying to compare the Language Pack versus the full Taiwan version.</p>
<p>So if you prefer the Taiwan style glyphs, you can just pick up the zh-HK Language Pack and a zh-TW system locale...</p>

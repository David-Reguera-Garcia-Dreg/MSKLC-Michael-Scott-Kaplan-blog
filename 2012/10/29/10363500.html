<p>The other day in <strong><a title="The evolving Story of Locale Support, part 28: We finally fixed that 'Install New Languages' thing!" href="../27/10362603.html">The evolving Story of Locale Support, part 28: We finally fixed that 'Install New Languages' thing!</a></strong>, I talked about the huge change in the way Microsoft handles purchase/licensing of localized content.</p>
<p>Offline, I had several people ask me why....</p>
<p>What had changed?</p>
<p>Well, mostly it was proving how poorly the old ways of doing things were for most end users!</p>
<p>For most copies of Windows, our "customer" is an OEM like Dell or Toshiba.</p>
<p>And although we provided many interesting and powerful SKU differentiation tools, the OEMs&nbsp;mostly didn't bother with them.</p>
<p>In many markets, they would just ship English, for example. Or something equally off-kilter.</p>
<p>Cheaper, easier, better for everyone!</p>
<p>Well, technically&nbsp;not everyone.</p>
<p>But they would seldom&nbsp;blame the OEM.</p>
<p>They would just blame Microsoft, of course!</p>
<p>And then problems like the ones described in <strong><a title="Intended Implicatures Redux, aka On Unintended Genuinosity Negation" href="../../../2010/06/13/10023980.html">Intended Implicatures Redux, aka On Unintended Genuinosity Negation</a></strong> would come up, and once again their bad planing/execution that forced users to ill-advised extremes?</p>
<p>Our fault, again.</p>
<p>So if we get no real financial benefit ourselves from "language as SKU differentiator", and we have major C-SAT and N-SAT issues to boot, it was easier to argue for a change in the model!</p>
<p>In some ways, this is the same kind of indictment on the OEMs as Surface, yet I don't think they'll feel it as much -- the new world makes us look better, but they don't look any worse....</p>
<p>We just got sick of taking the blame for their bugs.&nbsp;:-)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now it is easier than ever to get the language you want and be happier about it. Everybody wins!</p>

Unfortunately I can&#39;t find any photos of them right now, but they are pure usability nightmares.</p>

<p><strong>Matthew Slyman</strong> on 15 Apr 2013 10:10 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>BIG THANK YOU to Microsoft for this EXCELLENT change. I love being able to try out Windows in different languages, and it&#39;s great for my family since we speak/read English and Russian in our home, I have customers across Europe and have some degree of fluency in various other languages that need to be practiced from time to time in order to keep the skills current!</p>
<p>AS IT HAPPENS, my business is a registered partner of Microsoft (so I used to get access to the &quot;Ultimate&quot; version of Windows anyway), yet still, I am no longer limited to having multilingual Windows/Office on one machine only! I can have any language I want on the new Windows 8 Pro.</p>
<p>This is a huge step forward for accessibility too. Think of schools and public libraries that serve multicultural/multilingual parts of the world... No longer must they stick to only one main &quot;official&quot; language per machine, or shell out a fee to cater for the local language!</p>

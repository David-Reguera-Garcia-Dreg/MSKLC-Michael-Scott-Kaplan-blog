<h1>Is that an actual keyboard?</h1>

<p>I was shown this picture the other day, from <a href="http://9gag.com/gag/3143731">this</a> site:</p>
<p><a href="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/4503.chinesekeyboard01.jpg"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://blogs.msdn.com/resized-image.ashx/__size/550x0/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-33-81/4503.chinesekeyboard01.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>What he wanted to know was simple enough:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><em>Is it real, Michael?</em></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><em>And, if it is real, can I get it for Windows? In&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;8?</em></span></p>
<p>Well, it is on a site called 9gag.com, so I don't think it's real.</p>
<p>But in theory, it's possible to plug it in and such.</p>
<p>Now obviously the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms646299(v=vs.85).aspx">GetKeyboardState function</a> is limited to 256 key state values. So regular keyboard state info can't handle a keyboard that has so many keys.</p>
<p>But if you create&nbsp;a custom hardware driver, you can cause it to look like some of these keys are alternate shift states of each other that share the same scan code!</p>
<p>These are the kinds of tricks laptops use to enable their <strong>Fn</strong> keys; it is how Apple can make CTRL+ALT+BACKSP act like CTRL+ALT+DEL in Boot Camp (if they didn't, you would have to type CRTL+ALT+SHIFT+BACKSP!).</p>
<p>This would be a fun project to work on, wouldn't it? :-)</p>
<p>But like I said, I don't think it's real....</p>

<p>There&#39;s very little point to make a Chinese keyboard with characters line up in Changjei (it would be faster to just use Changjei IME) except for a good laugh... :P</p>
<p>So agreed it&#39;s not likely to be real... except maybe for memory tight DOS programs that don&#39;t use overlay so has tight memory requirement, therefore Chinese language support TSRs won&#39;t fit.</p>

<p>I was asked a question by the Contact link:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;"><em>I see you're speaking at IUC36. What is your currency talk going to be about?</em></span></p>
<p>He was referring to the talk I mentioned <strong><a title="Can you hear me now? How about on August 6th or September 20th or October 24th?" href="../../06/27/10324329.html">here</a></strong>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>October 24th @ 15:10</strong> in <strong>Santa Clara, California, USA</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><a href="http://www.unicodeconference.org/">36th Internationalization and Unicode Conference</a></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong></strong><strong>Show Me The Money!</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It has always been a rule at Microsoft that locale data is not changed for prior versions or in service packs for the current version. And like all rules, there is one major exception: currency values! I'll be taking you on an exciting journey of the many updates for the Euro, the Indian Rupee, the Turkish Lira, and other times that Microsoft has shown its customers the money....</p>
<p>&nbsp;It's kind of funny, actually.</p>
<p>I submitted six talks to the committee.</p>
<p>Later, I communicated to someone on the committee that they should just select two (I put them in my order of preference but said they were free to select another if they liked. Or even none if nothing appealed.</p>
<p>This talk was near the top of my list....</p>
<p>What I'll really do in this big money tour&nbsp;is cover the history of currency changes across Windows versions -- both what was done for the new version, and what was (or wasn't!) done for prior versions.</p>
<p>The fonts, the locales, the sort tables, the keyboards, everything!</p>
<p>I will cover the changing ways in the process over the years, sometimes even why.</p>
<p>Plus&nbsp;how the change floats out to other product groups, like Office and .NET and SQL Server. And Windows Sustained Engineering.</p>
<p>And as a bonus I can show how some of the new world may&nbsp;be easier&nbsp;for Windows 8 app developers!</p>
<p>It should be an exciting (and quick) tour of this thin thread that has run through Windows for pretty much its whole life!</p>
<p>Oh, that reminds me.</p>
<p>There is&nbsp;also a third presentation I'll be doing (they asked me to after something happened with another slot). I'll talk about that one another day....</p>

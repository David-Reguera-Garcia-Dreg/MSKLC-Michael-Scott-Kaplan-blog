<p>Back in part 23, there was a comment from Naravas:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;"><em>Tifinagh script in windows 8 is awesome but what about Amazigh language pack ? More than 50 million people speak Amazigh in north Africa and their PCs don't have their language.</em></span></p>
<p>I also got some email from several people asking the same question.</p>
<p>It put me in mind of the <a href="http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.ietf.languages/8957">Applying for a common Moroccan Amazigh subtag</a> thread on&nbsp;<strong>IETF Language tag discussions</strong> that Patrick Andries started back nearly at the beginning of 2011 that went on for several months.</p>
<p><em>People who regularly follow that list think me complaining about The Unicode List means I don't understand how these lists work. But believe me, I do!</em></p>
<p>Patrick's first post stated the basic issue of the thread:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">Hello,</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">Morocco has been teaching in schools since the early 2000's a convergent </span></em><br /><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">variant of Amazigh (Berber) using the Tifinagh script. This common </span></em><br /><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">variant aims to bridge gaps between the Berber variants in the country </span></em><br /><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">by eliminating what is seen as non essential phonetic variants </span></em><br /><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">("allophones") in the common script (this applies to some affricates, </span></em><br /><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">labiovelars and spirants, for some sounds there is simply no sign in the </span></em><br /><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">Tifinagh taught in schools). As far as grammar and the lexicon is </span></em><br /><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">concerned, the common variant teaches children that non-local words and </span></em><br /><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">syntactical features are equally valid but regional forms, enriching </span></em><br /><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">their vocabulary and syntactical knowledge this way (a bit like Brits </span></em><br /><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">know that an American truck is just a lorry).</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">Morocco would like register a new language code to refer to this common </span></em><br /><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">Amazigh written in Tifinagh. It is not satisfied with &laquo;ber&raquo; (for Berber </span></em><br /><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">languages, which is a collection of languages).</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">This being my first attempt to help registering a language subtag, I'm </span></em><br /><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">seeking some advice before applying for such a subtag.</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">I'm thinking at this stage to propose:</span></em></p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">As references, one could mention various schoolbooks and grammars:</span></em></p>

<p>Anyway, you can check the thread for long it stayed concise, as it moved around and argued about whether this was to be a standard language or a macro-language or a subtag or&nbsp; variant.</p>
<p>If I had to guess, I'm sure they'd have been happier in Morocco if we had named the locale <strong>Amazigh (Tifinagh, Morocco)</strong> rather than <strong>Central Atlas Tamazight (Tifinagh, Morocco)</strong>.</p>
<p>But since the code we had was <strong>tzm-Tfng-MA</strong> and there weren't (and still aren't) either ISO 639-* or BCP-47 tags or subtags for Amazigh (even though several Berber language have unique ISO 639-2 and/or ISO 693-3 tags, our hands were a little tied.</p>
<p>I mean, they have an army and a navy -- so why not give them a language tag? :-)</p>
<p>But until they do, our hands are tied....</p>
<p>Wikipedia gave up years ago, you know.</p>
<p>Any search for Tamazight or Amazigh or any of the variants thereof always tend to redirect to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berber_languages">Berber languages</a> topic, which tries to unpack the Berber situation as well as it can. Which is hard (check out the topic to see what I mean).</p>
<p>For now, we have two keyboards, font support, and language/locale info that was largely presented by people who if you asked them would probably say they were speaking Amazigh.</p>
<p>We have a few other locales that essentially use slightly different languages than their BCP-47 tags would indicate (a fact that keeps Patrick Andries in my inbox from time to time!).</p>
<p>And the locales of Windows continue to evolve....</p>

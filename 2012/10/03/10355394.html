<h1>The temptation to channel Grumpy Code Reviewer can be almost overwhelming!</h1>

<p>First, a few prior blogs so you can understand where I'm heading today:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><a title="Vietnamese is a complex language on Windows" href="../../../2005/08/27/457224.html">Vietnamese is a complex language on Windows</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a title="On my &quot;Vietnamese Plus&quot; and &quot;pseudo-Form V&quot; constructs" href="../../../2010/01/12/9946880.html">On my "Vietnamese Plus" and "pseudo-Form V" constructs</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a title="What's the difference between Tiếng Việt, Ti&amp;ecirc;́ng Việt, and Tiếng Việt? (other than the obvious, I mean)" href="../../02/29/10274340.html">What's the difference between Tiếng Việt, Ti&ecirc;́ng Việt, and Tiếng Việt? (other than the obvious, I mean)</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a title="How would *you* define debacle?" href="../../09/18/10350350.html">How would *you* define debacle?</a></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;While these blogs are placed correctly in a chronological&nbsp;sense, they may not be in a "understand where I'm coming from here" sense.</p>
<p>Basically, I'm talking about the Vietnamese keyboard, and how to get information from the data typed with it.</p>
<p>In&nbsp;blog 3 I described (with the help of John Cowan) the basis for why the "pseudo-Form V" (described in blog 2)&nbsp;exists, and how hard it would be fix with a regular code page.</p>
<p><em>Blog 4 was just about why all of that had to happen.</em></p>
<p>But there were some comments put into blog 1 from 2005&nbsp;by <em>Vadim Berman</em> in 2011-2012 on that original blog:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">October 10, 2011</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">Hi Michael,</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">It's a very old post but still important. I was wondering whether there is some kind of workaround for WideCharToMultiByte in Vietnamese. Everything is OK except for the letters with double diacritics, like ệ or ữ.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">What I don't understand is how it is different from Thai. Thai worked without any tweaking!</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">Is it possible to change the input and then recreate the characters that the conversion could not handle? I mean they exist in both cp1258 and Unicode, so this should be possible.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">Best regards,</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">Vadim</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">October 12, 2011</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">You might want to read the last comment <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7703114/using-widechartomultibyte-with-codepage-1258-vietnamese">here</a>. There is a workaround for the broken conversion.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">April 27, 2012</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">In the unlikely case that anyone still cares. <em><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7703114/using-widechartomultibyte-with-codepage-1258-vietnamese">here</a></em></span></p>
<p>The Stack Overflow link to code to "solve" the problem which&nbsp;actually points back to&nbsp;Vadim Berman's own blog!)&nbsp;is only a partial solution, mind you.</p>
<p><em>You can see Vadim Berman's blog <a href="../../../../../../digitalsonata.blogspot.com.es/2012/04/workaround-for-conversion-of-unicode.html">here</a>.</em></p>
<p>It solved replacing <strong><span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">WideCharToMultiByte(1258, ...)</span></strong> in its mjwc2mbstr function.</p>
<p>I didn't put my tester hat on to check results, but I put my program manager who used to be a dev hat on to do a bit of code review, and the code seems reasonable.</p>
<p>Though it doesn't do it in a very scalable way.</p>
<p>And if you needed to go back to Unicode, it doesn't handle <strong><span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">MultiByteToWideChar(1258, ...)</span></strong> properly in its mjmb2wcstr function at all. Which means lots of question marks. :-(</p>
<p>I tell you, the temptation to channel <a title="Grumpy Code Reviewer" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/">Grumpy Code Reviewer</a> can be almost overwhelming!</p>
<p>As can the temptation to feel guilty enough about&nbsp;not doing the code work for so long that someone else felt annoyed if to do it himself incorrectly that I'd go and write the solution myself.</p>
<p>I'll resist that fate, since it's code pages, and sublimate that guilt into honest keyboard work. :-)</p>
<p><em>Which reminds me of the time I recently violated the First Tester's Axiom for Vietnamese, and nothing was broken! Another day...</em></p>

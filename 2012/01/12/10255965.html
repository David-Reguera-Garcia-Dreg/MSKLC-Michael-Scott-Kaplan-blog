<h1>No, I am your father, Chris!</h1>

<p>The date was September 19, 2006.</p>
<p>The time was 1:56am.</p>
<p>The mail said:</p>
<p><em>Obi Wan Kaplanoibi,</em></p>
<p><em>There must be a way to force Windows to render Tahoma at 8pt whenever it wants to render it at 9pt - systemwide?</em></p>
<p><em>You're my only hope.</em></p>
<p><em>Chris</em></p>
<p>A mere 32 hours later, it turned into <strong><a title="Shrink that font -- automatically?" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/09/20/763219.html">Shrink that font -- automatically?</a></strong>.</p>
<p><em>Things were a bit more "rough and ready" in those early days!</em></p>
<p>Now I doubt I ever even set eyes on the email since that time.</p>
<p>Until last night.</p>
<p>You see, last night I was looking for a different email from around that time.</p>
<p>And I saw the original email address.of Chris.</p>
<p>It was <strong><a href="mailto:chris@lockergnome.com">chris@lockergnome.com</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Call me crazy, but I'm reasonably certain that was (is?) Chris Pirillo.</p>
<p>Nw if you look back in <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19980415063654/http://www.pirillo.com/">the Wayback Machine</a> at <a href="http://www.pirillo.com/">http://www.pirillo.com/</a> you see that the site first started in 1998. he had just graduated recently from the University of Northern Iowa.</p>
<p>When he wrote to me originally? He was a student there. It may have even been related to a homework assignment!</p>
<p><em>The relstive speed of my response was obviated by the fact that I never replied directly to him and didn't answer the question, choosing to tell a story his mail reminded me of, instead!</em></p>
<p>I had never met him in person until just a few years ago - a friend of Ellen's.</p>
<p>But y then I certainly knew who he was!</p>
<p>Now I can mostly blame the Star Warsiasn feel of what popped in my head when I saw this on his "Obi Wan" reference.</p>
<p>But what I imagined was him saying to me was (in a mechanically modified James Earl Jones voice):</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darth_Vader"><img style="max-width: 550px;" border="0" alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/76/Darth_Vader.jpg" /></a></p>
<p><em>"I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan. We meet again, at last. The circle is now complete. When I left you, I was but the learner; now *I* am the master." </em></p>
<p>And of course the quote in the title.</p>
<p>Now I'm not gonna call Chris evil, but he <em>did</em> move over mostly to Apple stuff years back. So it's a relative thing... :-)</p>

Oh well. &nbsp;It will happen if it is going to, right? </p>

<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 16 Jan 2012 6:20 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Just because something is evil doesn&#39;t keep people from loving it; phrases like &quot;ugly as sin&quot; ignore the fact that it is the attractiveness of sin that leads people to do it!</p>
<p>So deggree of love an iPod Touch and degree of evility of Apple are semi-independent issues!</p></div>
<p><strong>cron22</strong> on 17 Jan 2012 11:01 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Thanks for the reminder LOL. &nbsp;I still feel that Apple tend to put more restrictions on their dev community than you guys do, hence why I have been following the activities of Microsoft for so many years. &nbsp;</p>

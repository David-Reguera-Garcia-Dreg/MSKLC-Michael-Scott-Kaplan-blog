<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Offtopic. Very offtopic. In fact, as offtopic as you can get without a prescription!</em></span></p>
<p>Some questions I get entertain, some amuse, and some I just don't know what exactly to do with.</p>
<p>But this one kind of takes the cake!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">I know you've written&nbsp;about porn in the past, so I thought you might have insight into the connection between the search engine Bing and star Carmella Bing?</span></em></p>
<p>Well, &nbsp;it is perhaps a bit of an overstatement.</p>
<p>Over the last few years, it&nbsp;has been&nbsp;limited to just a few blogs, pretty much always related to linguistic issues like in&nbsp;<strong><a title="Somewhere between a glossary and a lexicon, safe[ enough] for work" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/05/30/8562102.html">Somewhere between a glossary and a lexicon, safe[ enough] for work</a></strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong><a title="On the [pragmatic?] pronunciation of &quot;XXX&quot;" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/06/15/8599437.html">On the [pragmatic?] pronunciation of "XXX"</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Hardly a dedicated blog category, if you know what I mean!</p>
<p>Anyway, I've never met Carmella Bing, or seen her in action, as it were.</p>
<div><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmella_Bing"><img border="0" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Carmella_Bing_at_Wicked_Pictures_party_1.jpg" width="170" height="200" /></a></div>
<p>I've talked to some people who know her and they she is&nbsp;a very nice person.</p>
<p>owever,&nbsp;according to the IAFD website ( NTSFW link <a href="http://www.iafd.com/person.rme/perfid=CarmellaBing/gender=f/Carmella-Bing.htm">here</a>), her career began in 2006. And the Bing search engine started up in 2009 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bing">according to Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p>Clearly, her name was not inspired by the Microsoft web site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;It also seems <strong>highly</strong> unlikely to me that the Bing Decision Engine was inspired by the adult actress.</p>
<p>The few people I know over there who I asked were at best amused, but everyone was sure it was just &nbsp;a coincidence.</p>
<p>Back in 2009, I vaguely recall a Reddit thread about <strong>How long before Microsoft sues pornstar Carmella Bing?</strong> as well as a few similar blogs, which I only mention here so that the person who asked me&nbsp;doesn't think the name issue hadn't ever occurred to anyone else.</p>
<p>She still has her stage name, and the Decision Engine didn't rename itself.</p>
<p>In the end, sometimes a Cigar is just&nbsp;a Cigar. And a Bing is just&nbsp;a Bing....</p>

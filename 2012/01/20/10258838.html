<p>You probably know people, or work with people, or are one of those people, who calls it an "ATM machine".</p>
<p>And&nbsp;you may know people, or work with people, or are one of those people, who calls it a "Light Emitting LASER".</p>
<p>Hopefully you laughed when the mobsters from the movie Mickey Blue Eyes&nbsp;noted&nbsp;the sign on the restaurant "The La Trattoria", despite the fact that the meaning of the phrase was "The The Trattoria", as a sign of irony at he faux intellectual bravado leading to ignorance of a proper name of a fancy <span style="color: #808080; text-decoration: line-through;">French</span>Italian&nbsp;restaurant.</p>
<p>Perhaps you were around to chuckle with Mike or Cathy or I when a particular goup admin used to refer to "Very VIP people", realizing the meaning of "VIP" inlude the word being repeated.</p>
<p>Many people I know found it mildly ironic that natives and former natives of Iran wanted their language فارسى (spelling AFEH ALEF REH SEEN ALEF MAKSURA) called Persian rather then Farsi, even though the native name was [pronounced&nbsp;FARSI by those same native speakers.</p>
<p>And yet, I do not want to know if you&nbsp;make this other mistake.</p>
<p>I am going to say <strong>La La La I am not listening to you yet you ar still talking </strong>if you try to confess you are guilty of it.</p>
<p>And after you have read this blog today you will be able to point out the mistake any time someone else makes it.</p>
<p>Anytime you see Google Maps refer to locations as being in&nbsp;the "Sahara Desert" like so:</p>
<p><a href="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/8080.Sahara01.jpg"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://blogs.msdn.com/resized-image.ashx/__size/550x0/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-33-81/8080.Sahara01.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Because the word for Desert in Arabic is</p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large;">&nbsp;صحراء </span></p>
<p>aka&nbsp;ARABIC LETTER SAD + ARABIC LETTER HAH + ARABIC LETTER REH + ARABIC LETTER ALEF + ARABIC LETTER HAMZA</p>
<p>aka&nbsp;SAD HAH REH ALEF HAMZA</p>
<p>aka SAHARA.</p>
<p>Because you know it is silly to call the sandy, hot region in Northern Africa the <strong>Desert Desert</strong>.</p>
<p>You aren't that silly, right? :-)</p>

<p>&quot;Many people I know found it mildly ironic that natives and former natives of Iran wanted their language called Persian rather then Farsi&quot; Yet I&#39;d guess those people don&#39;t see a problem with almost every other language, from Albanian to Welsh, being called in English something different than how it is natively pronounced.</p>

<p>The Gobi (&#39;desert&#39;) Desert, the River Avon (&#39;water&#39;), and the Missisippi (&#39;big river&#39;) River have the names they have for a reason. &nbsp;When we borrow someone else&#39;s name for something, we don&#39;t borrow it by parts but as a whole, and its etymology in the source language is irrelevant. &nbsp;Sombrero in Spanish means &#39;hat&#39;, but in English it means &#39;traditional Mexican hat&#39;, and that&#39;s the way it is. &nbsp;It would be senseless to claim that a beret or a bowler is a sombrero in English.</p>
<p>So don&#39;t try to influence the hoi polloi (&#39;the many&#39;) on this one: it won&#39;t fly.</p>

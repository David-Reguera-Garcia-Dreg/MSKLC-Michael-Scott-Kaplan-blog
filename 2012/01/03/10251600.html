<h1>Better know an Exec, part 0 (the introduction)</h1>

<p><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">This blog will have some "name dropping" in it, due to its nature. ignore it, they are all just people! :-)</span></em></p>
<p>During Microsoft's annual poll, there is one set of&nbsp;questions that traditionally has answers given by many people that give a wide variety of answers -- and not always positive ones.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The kinds of results are ones that teams want to work on, to improve.</p>
<p>The questions relate to our executives, the leadership team -- our leaders:&nbsp;whether they understand our work, the needs of our customers. Whether they have a plan, whether we know what that plan is, and whether they are delivering on that plan.</p>
<p>Now I'll admit that my own answers have overall trended neutral to negative on these questions over the years.</p>
<p>And although management takes such concerns seriously, and gets execs in front of us to talk about the future and plans and thoughts, these efforts didn't do much for me.</p>
<p>I mean, it can be cool to have my group -- WWLI (Windows and Windows Live International) -- bring in people like <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/cjones/">Windows Live Corporate VP Chris Jones</a> or <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/julielar/">Windows Corporate VP Julie Larson-Green</a> or <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/ssinofsky/">Windows and Windows Live President Steven Sinofsky</a>. And every one of those talks&nbsp;was interesting.</p>
<p>But to my view there are real limitations in the approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>any exec can sound good in a brief, semi-scripted internal moment (whether they are impressive or not!)&nbsp;-- even <em>I</em> can do <strong>that</strong> much;</li>
<li>I never felt clueless about what my division was doing -- it was the parts outside of my division in the wider company&nbsp;that I was less sure about, and had less confidence in;</li>
<li>there was no opportunity to make real connections in large group settings like that.</li>
</ul>
<p>I was a little frustrated, realizing that I was complaining about things that my own management was taking seriously --&nbsp;but that were not in effect actionable for them.</p>
<p>Bringing in leaders from unrelated parts of the company is way outside of reasonable just to have random company strategy concerns of people like me assuaged, after all.</p>
<p><strong>In short, I was wasting everyone's time.</strong></p>
<p>Well, not just me, since I was not a lone voice bringing down the average. But I contributed to it.</p>
<p>Now I know some Microsoft execs and leaders&nbsp;even read this Blog from time to time, but that would just be for them to learn about my me and thoughts, not the other way around.</p>
<p>I was stumped.</p>
<p>Then I thought back to the exec interactions I had in the past, the ones where I&nbsp;felt like real connections were being made, that gave me confidence in what these people&nbsp;were doing.</p>
<p>Whether it was formal situations like meeting&nbsp;with <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/Chan/">Corporate VP or Windows Devices and Networking Technologies Chuck Chan</a> to talk about the need to get in Windows Quality Gates updates.</p>
<p>Or less formal situations like chatting with <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/devaan/">Corporate VP of Windows Development Jon DeVaan</a> after MSKLC got an honorable mention at an Engineering Excellence awards ceremony where he talked about why he stayed so involved in EE efforts.</p>
<p>Or talking pointedly&nbsp;to <a title="Chief People Officer Lisa Brummel" href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/brummel/">Chief People Officer Lisa Brummel</a> about my concerns about what struck&nbsp;me as both technical and marketing flaws in the approach that was being taken with the health care changes, and hearing her candid thouhts on the subject.</p>
<p>And several other interactions -- with Terry Crowley and&nbsp;Jeanne Sheldon and&nbsp;Rich Kaplan and Richard Mcaniff&nbsp;and Tod Nielsen&nbsp;and Mark Russinovich and Wael Bahaa El-Din and Brian Valentine and many&nbsp;others --&nbsp;about a wide variety of topics (professional and occasionally other) that all have just one thing in common.</p>
<p>Each time I had the chance to have&nbsp;a direct (even if at times brief) conversation with an exec about an issue that was important (to me, and sometimes to them) and observe their unscripted reactions, and to&nbsp;get glimpses&nbsp;at&nbsp;their thought processes, directly.</p>
<p>I can't say I always agreed with each one of them every single time. But&nbsp;overall I had more confidence each time one of these interactions happened. I felt like I knew them better from than than from any of the large group events.</p>
<p>Longer interactions were even better than short ones given the risks around boilerplate coverage of some issues, but all provided some insight.</p>
<p>Some value.</p>
<p>And suddenly, I knew what I had to do.</p>
<p>All I had to do was spend extended time with some leaders, some executives -- to see them do their work and make decisions and such. Enough time that I could come away from it all feeling more confident about the direction of the company and the people running it.</p>
<p>Or if not, then&nbsp;at least feeling like there was good reason for lack of confidence!</p>
<p>Easy, right? :-)</p>
<p>As it turns out, it has proven so far to be easier than I thought it was, thanks to the MS Auctions from the Giving Campaign!</p>
<p>When the dust cleared and the auctions closed, I got a great email from a frend/colleague:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="font-size: small;" size="3"><span style="font-family: Calibri;" face="Calibri">Heard that you cleared up and got 5 (?) leaders time through auction site, huge congrats that's quite a feat!! </span></span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="font-size: small;" size="3"><span style="font-family: Calibri;" face="Calibri">Anything you want to get out of it or you just want to have some fun? </span></span></em></p>
<p>Well, I answered, maybe just a little of both. Plus it was acually six if you include an amazing dinner (which it tured out&nbsp;she was also at, as luck would have it), and even all those didn't include some of auctions I lost in!</p>
<p><em>Painfully obvious realization: when you aim for 12, winning five doesn't feel nearly as impressive. But had I won then all, my manager might have to step in to talk about all the time I was missing fo my actual job over the next few months. :-)</em></p>
<p>Anyway,&nbsp;perhaps it is important to not be quite so greedy -- and to sincerely appreciate the afforded&nbsp;opportunities thmselves.</p>
<p>And to share what I can of them with you!</p>
<p>And thus begins this journey.</p>
<p>My journey.</p>
<p>Our journey.</p>
<p>A journey to <strong>better know our execs</strong>.</p>
<p>You can perhaps think of it as a non-parody salute to Stephen Colbert's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Better_Know_a_District">Better Know a District</a>&sup1;, and a way for people who are just as curious to delve into this area&sup2; to have the opportunity to&nbsp;live vicariously through me. And&nbsp;to gain some&nbsp;relevant insights, and at times perhaps to also be inspired.</p>
<p>That was my true goal here -- to b inspired. I'll let you decide whether I succeeded, as I discuss one leader at a time.</p>
<p>Starting in if not my next blog&nbsp;then a blog coming up very soon, I'll give the first part of the series....</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>John Cowan</strong> on 7 Jan 2012 10:29 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>What about when scripted responses are simply correct? &nbsp;That&#39;s why we have FAQs, after all: to avoid having to make scripted responses all the time.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 7 Jan 2012 2:54 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>And that part is fine -- but I tend to think of sincere leadership as being that which is not phoning in the bullet points -- and that is what scripted responses can feel like....</p></div>
<p><strong>Jenny</strong> on 9 Jan 2012 9:59 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>LOVE that you had a great time Michael, you really capture the culture of accountability that exists in CSS! </p>
<p>Enjoyed Canlis :-) Look forward to hearing your thoughts there. </p>

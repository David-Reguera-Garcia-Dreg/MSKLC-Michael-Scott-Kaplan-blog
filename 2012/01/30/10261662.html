<h1>An SDK for the OSK? No way. Though if I may, I'll just say...</h1>

<p>So the other day, I was contacted by hal hubschman, with&nbsp;a message.</p>
<p>Kind of a request for information.</p>
<p>It went like this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><em><b>Subject</b>: on screen keyboards</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;"><em>i read a number of your blog entries which i found informative. &nbsp;i have been trying to find a osk sdk with no luck.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;"><em>do you know if one exists ?</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;"><em>thank you for the blogs you have created</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;"><em>hal</em></p>
<p>Hmmm.</p>
<p>I usually hate questions like this.</p>
<p>Because they force me to answer with a rather hopeless negative.</p>
<p>I mean, since there is no public&nbsp;<strong>Software&nbsp;Driver Kit (SDK)</strong> for any version of the <strong>On Screen Keyboard (OSK)</strong> shipped with any version of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows (including the new one in Windows 8)</li>
<li>Office</li>
<li>Tablet PC</li>
</ul>
<p>whatsoever.</p>
<p>I hate that - very frustrating, why even cover this one in a blog?</p>
<p>But then, after writing the above, I looked over next to me.</p>
<p>To my <strong>Amazon Kindle</strong>.</p>
<p>On the screen?</p>
<p>The book I had just finished re-reading: <strong>Ender's Game</strong>, by <strong>Orson Scott Card</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;And I suddenly wondered whether if <strong>Ender Wiggins</strong> expressed such a depressing thought,&nbsp;if <strong>Bean</strong> wouldn't push him past this seemingly unbreakable wall.</p>
<p><em>As a&nbsp;by the way, and not for nothing, for those of you have never read <strong>Ender's Game</strong>, by <strong>Orson Scott Card</strong>, you're truly missing a really good book. You should look into it!</em></p>
<p>I suddenly realized I was looking at this the wrong way.</p>
<p>Each of those <strong>On Screen Keyboards</strong>, those <strong>Soft Keyboards</strong>, were designed to wrap the various keyboards provided by <strong>Windows</strong> and <strong>kbdtool.exe</strong>, by <strong>MSKLC</strong> and <strong>kbdutool.exe</strong>.</p>
<p>So&nbsp;perhaps there was no SDK to let anyone control any aspect of any version of the OSK.</p>
<p>But you could, through MSKLC, control any exposed aspect of the OSK's behavior anyway!</p>
<p>Okay, this is not exactly the answer hal hubschman was perhaps hoping for -- maybe he wanted&nbsp;a&nbsp;way to extend an actual OSK, any OSK.</p>
<p>The only supported&nbsp;way to do that, however, is to create one's own OSK.</p>
<p>That would take a bunch of blogs worth of knowledge, though a lot of them technically already written....</p>
<p>It would&nbsp;be a huge effort to try to string them all together like jigsaw puzzle, filling in the gaps representing missing blogs, though not completely impossible.</p>
<p>Just highly improbable!</p>
<p>For now I'll hope that my other answer is sufficient for hal hubschman's question. :-)</p>
<hr/><p><strong>Simon Buchan</strong> on 30 Jan 2012 6:14 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>I&#39;m just guessing, but he could be meaning an SDK* that supported creating OSKs, since as you mention it otherwise requires a bunch of special knowledge - exactly the situation SDKs exist for!</p>
<p>* Which I&#39;ve normally seen expanded as &quot;Software Development Kit&quot;, meaning a kit for (making it easier to) develop software. I&#39;m not sure how to parse the expansion you gave!</p>

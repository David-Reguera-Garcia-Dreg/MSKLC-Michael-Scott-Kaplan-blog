<p>At least I know Paul was thinking of me, so I don't have to wonder about that part!</p>
<p>You see, the other day, my friend (and former colleague from Microsoft) tweeted to me over Twitter:</p>
<p><a href="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/1106.lpcab01.jpg"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://blogs.msdn.com/resized-image.ashx/__size/550x0/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-33-81/1106.lpcab01.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Ah, a somewhat under-documented bit of info, that.</p>
<p>It&nbsp;involves <strong>LPKSETUP.EXE</strong>.</p>
<p>Let's try running it:</p>
<p><a href="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/6136.lpcab02.jpg"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://blogs.msdn.com/resized-image.ashx/__size/550x0/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-33-81/6136.lpcab02.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>A nice dialog pops up, whether Vista or Windows Server 2008 or Windows 7 or Windows 2008 R2.</p>
<p>It looks like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/4478.lpcab03.jpg"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://blogs.msdn.com/resized-image.ashx/__size/550x0/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-33-81/4478.lpcab03.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Now obviously we want to <strong>Install display languages</strong> (if anyone wants to look into either the <strong>Uninstall display languages</strong> or <strong>How do I get additional display languages?</strong> options, they can do so, of course!).</p>
<p>Anyway, once you choose to <strong>Install display languages</strong>, you'll see the option to <strong>Choose your method of install</strong>:</p>
<p><a href="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/8461.lpcab04.jpg"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://blogs.msdn.com/resized-image.ashx/__size/550x0/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-33-81/8461.lpcab04.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>That <strong>Launch Windows Update</strong> option may be of some interest, in other circumstances. After all, it points out the other way to find Language Packs.</p>
<p>But for now we'll stick with Paul's scenario, and <strong>Browse computer or network</strong>. How better to <strong>Locate and install display languages manually</strong>, anyway?</p>
<p>Here we go:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/8400.lpcab05.jpg"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://blogs.msdn.com/resized-image.ashx/__size/550x0/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-33-81/8400.lpcab05.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Okay, I'll now explain a little bit of how this dialog works.</p>
<p>You choose a directory.</p>
<p>And then it will traverse that directory <em>and its subdirectory</em> (<strong>and no further subsubdirctories!</strong>) to look for Language Packs or Language Interface Packs!</p>
<p>I took the trouble to copy&nbsp;16 different <strong>lp.cab</strong>&nbsp;files to my local Windows 7&nbsp;machine, in a directory structure I have never personally witnessed:</p>
<p><a href="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/3757.lpcab06.jpg"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://blogs.msdn.com/resized-image.ashx/__size/550x0/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-33-81/3757.lpcab06.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Now when I&nbsp;browse to the subdirectory, the magic happens.</p>
<p><em>Well, I guess I can't call it "magic" just like I can't call a card trick "magic" if I have to manually change the order of the deck in front of you to make the trick work!</em></p>
<p>Anyway, you'll see it detected a bunch of valid <strong>lp.cab</strong> files:</p>
<p><a href="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/5545.lpcab07.jpg"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://blogs.msdn.com/resized-image.ashx/__size/550x0/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-33-81/5545.lpcab07.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Only 12 of them are valid for my Windows 7 x64 machine; the other 4 are Windows 7 x86 machines -- though they could have also been other Windows version Language Packs/Language Interface Packs;they'll all fail here.</p>
<p>I suppose this explains why <strong>LPKSETUP.EXE</strong> doesn't traverse any deeper -- since it is taking the time to open up every <strong>CAB</strong> file (I renamed several of them to be sure) and see if its valid. Traversing too deep could potentially start to get painful!</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000; font-size: medium;">Note to CSS: A Microsoft Knowledge Base article aimed primarily at IT folk/system builders explaining&nbsp;how to properly make use of LPKSETUP.EXE to allow any language selection&nbsp;the IT folk/system builders&nbsp;choose to make appear to their users<strong> (<em>with the proper steps to work properly with secured desktops</em>) </strong>may be the most completely awesome-est KB article of the year!<strong> Any takers?</strong></span></p>
<p>Okay, so that's it. Hopefully it will answer Paul's question.... :-)</p>
<p>I wonder what he's been up to. who he's with, what he's thinking <strong>(using Vista?!?)</strong>, and if he'll ever return someday.&nbsp;Don't you?</p>
<p>So I'm just wondering about Paul -- what he's been up to, who he's with....</p>
<p>I suppose I am in&nbsp;a La Rut myself!</p>

<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 20 Jan 2012 8:48 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Ugh, I need to start including alt text in the images!!!</p></div>

<p><strong>cron22</strong> on 22 Jan 2012 8:41 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>It&#39;s okay though, because how would you have known? &nbsp;I always have to alert people to missing alt-text. &nbsp;You should have seen the way I had to alert the folks at my college, and they got right down to it and it was fixed. &nbsp;I wouldn&#39;t worry about that though. &nbsp;You guys don&#39;t have to worry about Section 508, do you? &nbsp;</p>

</div>
<p><strong>cron22</strong> on 23 Jan 2012 12:59 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Yes, I remember. &nbsp;The moment you said something about that last year, I just got hooked on your blog and I try to read your entertainment every day because I really get a laugh as well as a good technical education out of what you have to say. &nbsp;And thanks for being on my side. &nbsp;You should talk to the programmers for me and maybe you could ask them to quit making standards and then ignoring them? &nbsp;Think MS Expression, for example. &nbsp;We as blind individuals have to rely on either self-created or community-created scripts for it to work, and there&#39;s one company who ignores us because to them, it&#39;s not a &quot;supported application&quot;. &nbsp;</p>

</ul>
<p>Windows support of locales, and in fact the whole locale model in Windows is impressive.</p>
<p>It's substantial.</p>
<p>And....</p>
<p><strong>It's as confusing as all get out!</strong></p>
<p>I mean, even almost seven years ago when I wrote <strong><a title="What is my locale? Well, which locale do you mean?" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/02/01/364707.html">What is my locale? Well, which locale do you mean?</a></strong> to list and define all the different kins of locales in Windows:</p>
<ul>
<li>DEFAULT USER LOCALE (Windows XP term: "Standards and Formats")</li>
<li>DEFAULT SYSTEM LOCALE (Windows XP term: "Language for non-Unicode Programs")</li>
<li>DEFAULT USER INTERFACE LANGUAGE (Windows XP Term: "Language used in menus and dialogs")</li>
<li>DEFAULT INPUT LOCALE (Windows XP Term: "Default Input Language")</li>
</ul>
<p>I was self-consciously aware of how confusing everyone found all this.</p>
<p>Now virtually everyone I&nbsp;talked too agreed that each term was entirely <strong>explainable</strong>, especially in Windows XP and later when they were each given new terms that didn't use the same word <strong>LOCALE</strong> over and over again.</p>
<p>But the only ones who were willing to call this motley crew <strong>intuitive</strong> were completely and totally high at the time.</p>
<p>And I'll be honest, the&nbsp;ones unwilling to call it intuitive&nbsp;were right.</p>
<p>The model, as expansive&nbsp;and feature-filled as it may be, is incredibly confusing.</p>
<p>The previous changes aimed at incrementally improving terminology were perhaps worthwhile, but ultimately unable to solve the real problem.</p>
<p>Until Windows 8....</p>
<p>Now first they take the old Regional and Language Options:</p>
<p><a href="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/1234.Part15_2D00_01.jpg"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://blogs.msdn.com/resized-image.ashx/__size/550x0/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-33-81/1234.Part15_2D00_01.jpg" /></a><a href="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/2816.Part15_2D00_01.jpg"></a></p>
<p>(shown here from Windows&nbsp;7)&nbsp;to start.</p>
<p>Now instead of one Control Panel Applet, there are now two. in the Control Panel:</p>
<p><a href="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/5875.Part15_2D00_00.jpg"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://blogs.msdn.com/resized-image.ashx/__size/550x0/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-33-81/5875.Part15_2D00_00.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>One for Region, with just three tabs, none of which say Language:</p>
<p><a href="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/8625.Part15_2D00_02.jpg"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://blogs.msdn.com/resized-image.ashx/__size/550x0/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-33-81/8625.Part15_2D00_02.jpg" /></a><a href="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/8468.Part15_2D00_02.jpg"></a></p>
<p>and one new one, for Language:</p>
<p><a href="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/5040.Part15_2D00_04.jpg"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://blogs.msdn.com/resized-image.ashx/__size/550x0/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-33-81/5040.Part15_2D00_04.jpg" /></a><a href="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/7043.Part15_2D00_04.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Now this Language Control Panel Applet is for User Interface Languages (if they are installed), for another language specific services (if <strong>they</strong> are installed) and for Keyboard Layouts (whether atop actual hardware keyboards or soft keyboard layouts).</p>
<p>You can see the new Keyboard List right here - notice the order is the same as from the <strong>Language</strong> applet, above:</p>
<p><a href="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/8780.Part15_2D00_03.jpg"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://blogs.msdn.com/resized-image.ashx/__size/550x0/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-33-81/8780.Part15_2D00_03.jpg" /></a><a href="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/0564.Part15_2D00_03.jpg"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Now this does start to thin the herd in a more meaningful way.</p>
<p>Though speaking for myself it is an odd direction when you consider that both the <strong>Formats</strong> list is configured over the Region applet, and the Keyboards list&nbsp;is configured in the Language applet, and that both of their built-in lists are considerably larger&nbsp;than User Interface languages or any other services.</p>
<p>Though now with changes like the ones described in <strong><a title="part 2 (raising the roof on keyboards)" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2011/11/02/10232468.html">part 2 (raising the roof on keyboards)</a></strong>, the keyboard list is now no longer completely limited to "supported locales" that populate the&nbsp;<strong>Formats List</strong>&nbsp;anyway.</p>
<p>So perhaps my concerns about the mode of disconnect are unwarranted. :-)</p>
<p>I will conditionally consider this to be a good evolutionary step that will simplify setting up Windows for typical users -- whether chnging UI language, adding keyboards, or whatever.</p>
<p>In the long run, I think the direction here will only get better and better over time.</p>
<p>Now in future parts, I'll dig in further here, looking at programmatic new means of getting information....</p>

<p>Except that it isn&#39;t. In the Language applet, Khmer is above Arabic; in the keyboard list, they&#39;ve swapped positions.</p>

<h1>If font linking doesn't fit the text to a T (or ț!), a Romanian letter may be right but not quite look it</h1>

<p>I've talked about font linking in a bunch of&nbsp;different blogs&nbsp;over the years, such as:</p>

</ul>
<p>and so on. Many of them make a point implicitly that I am going to make quite explicit today.</p>
<p>And that point is simply <strong>The thing that sucks most about GDI font linking is the way it mixes fonts that don't look right next to each other</strong>.</p>
<p>Anyway, the other day colleague and coworker Laura passed on a question people were trying to get a handle on.</p>
<p>Basically, it was a Romanian product that had strings looking something like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/1016.fontlink01.jpg"><img border="0" alt="The Ts don't all seem to line up here!" src="http://blogs.msdn.com/resized-image.ashx/__size/550x0/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-33-81/1016.fontlink01.jpg" width="138" height="54" /></a></p>
<p>Let me blow that up in case your browser doesn't make it bigger:</p>
<p><a href="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/3113.fontlink02.jpg"><img border="0" alt="The Ts don't all seem to line up here, but bigger!" src="http://blogs.msdn.com/resized-image.ashx/__size/550x0/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-33-81/3113.fontlink02.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Now they were claiming to be using Segoe UI.</p>
<p>And for whatever it's worth,&nbsp;the glyphs of most of the characters look to my amateur eye to be somewhat Segoe-like, perhaps. But not exactly.</p>
<p>Remember that at one point, there were many more fonts floating around that were missing these characters.</p>
<p><em>Perhaps&nbsp;a forensic typographer could do better, a-la <strong><a title="İ ş&eacute;&egrave; đ&ecirc;&auml;đ ķ&eacute;&yuml;&scaron;" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/08/22/4519235.html">İ ş&eacute;&egrave; đ&ecirc;&auml;đ ķ&eacute;&yuml;&scaron;</a></strong> etc.</em></p>
<p>But do you see the fourth letter, which is clearly U+0074, aka LATIN SMALL LETTER T, versus the sixth letter, which is clearly U+021b, aka LATIN SMALL LETTER T WITH COMMA BELOW?</p>
<p>Well, Segoe UI does not look this weird with these Latin letters alongside each other.</p>
<p>In fact, here is just about every <strong>S</strong> and <strong>s</strong> and <strong>T</strong> and <strong>t</strong> in Segoe UI, right next to each other:</p>
<p><a href="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/7635.fontlink03.jpg"><img border="0" alt="Comparig all the Ss and Ts in Segoe UI -- all the same size." src="http://blogs.msdn.com/resized-image.ashx/__size/550x0/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-33-81/7635.fontlink03.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>None come even close to being this incorrect looking....</p>
<p>For the sake of good looking Romanian text, at least!</p>
<p>Thankfully, they're going to fix this one, before a negative entry would need to be added to&nbsp;lists like <strong><a title="The history of messing up Romanian on computers" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2011/08/24/10199324.html">The history of messing up Romanian on computers</a></strong>. If you know what I&nbsp;mean....</p>
<p>Though even if not, we've come a long way banishing the cedillas from Romanian text, right? :-)</p>
<hr/><p><strong>John Cowan</strong> on 26 Jan 2012 8:52 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>In one sense you are right, but it is *way* better to use the right letter in the wrong font than to just render a stupid box, as all applications did until fairly recently. &nbsp;As far as I know, browsers led the way here. &nbsp;(Of course, before Unicode a box was the best you could do, because you were only guessing at what the character meant anyway.)</p>

<p><strong>Cristian</strong> on 26 Jan 2012 9:04 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Speaking of products with problems... G□□gle has released the latest maps.google.ro (or .fr, .de, .it, but not the .com) with maps rendered with fonts lacking s and t comma bellow.</p>

<p>Unfortunately G□□gle use almost exclusively cedillas in their Romanian product translations.</p>

<p><strong>Miguel Sousa</strong> on 26 Jan 2012 12:26 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Since Segoe UI supports U+021b, why was it showing up that way? You don&#39;t really explain in the post.</p>

<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 27 Jan 2012 7:28 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>The original font wasn&#39;t Segoe UI....</p>

<p><strong>Cristian</strong> on 27 Jan 2012 8:55 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Since I&#39;ve talked about G□□gle which has problems with s comma and t comma characters, I should talk also about Microsoft which has problems with the old characters s cedilla and t cedilla.

<p>I think this relates somehow to the problem presented in this blog entry.</p>

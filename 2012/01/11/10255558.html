<p>Today's Exec is not a stranger to&nbsp;m.</p>
<p>In fact my connection to <a title="Customer &amp;amp; Partner Advocacy Corporate VP Rich Kaplan" href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/kaplan/">Customer &amp; Partner Advocacy Corporate VP Rich Kaplan</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>dates back to August of 2007 and an irate customer who was cold calling every Kaplan in the phone book trying to accost him!</p>
<p>(I told the story previously in <strong><a title="Are you Mr. Kaplan?" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/08/29/4633356.html">Are you Mr. Kaplan?</a></strong>)</p>
<p>He and I&nbsp;would then bump into each other over the following years, like at summits and presentations and such.</p>
<p>One of those times, we talked about our shared name, and I told him my "Ellis Island" story. told previously in <strong><a title="My name is Dragutsky. Michael Dragutsky" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/01/06/7001564.html">My name is Dragutsky. Michael Dragutsky</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Another time I was having lunch in the Commons with Ellen and he came up to me introduced his parents (two other Kaplans!).</p>
<p>He is the first Exec I talked with&nbsp;about my desire to see the corporate matching ceiling raised, and as one of those people who contributes heavily to Fred Hutch, he definitely knows where I am coming from</p>
<p>My friend <a href="http://microsoftjobsblog.com/blog/jenny-lay-flurrie-working-through-challenges-to-achieve-success-and-enable-others">Jenny Lay-Flurrie</a> who I met&nbsp;a few years back talking about education about accessibility, just recently took on&nbsp;new role in the&nbsp;Customer and Partner Advocacy org, working for Rich.</p>
<p>You might say that within one conversation/two emails with her and one with Rich, I began to really crystallize what would become points 3, 4, and 5 from <strong><a title="What I'd do with my 'Microsoft 20% time'" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2011/12/23/10250600.html">What I'd do with my 'Microsoft 20% time'</a></strong>!</p>
<p>As I bounced ideas off them, my more nebulous aspirations began to take shape, so perhaps you may want to think of some of&nbsp;this blog today as an origin story, of sorts!</p>
<p>It started right after <strong><a title="Hanging with Marlena Werder + her skip &amp;amp; skipskip level!" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2012/01/09/10254462.html">Hanging with Marlena Werder + her skip &amp; skipskip level!</a></strong>.</p>
<p>I was taking a taxi from the <a href="http://www.thewoodmark.com/">Woodmark</a> to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.canlis.com/">Canlis</a>, because despite the fact that I was traveling from spending the day with three VPs and&nbsp;a Leadership Teem to have diner with another VP and his wife, Shuttle Services simply couldn't accommodate my needs.</p>
<p><em>{Insert eye roll here! I get the feeling that if I was leaving Steve t meet Bill they still wouldn't be able to help me!}</em></p>
<p>Anyway, with the help of&nbsp;a cab driver who was promised a&nbsp;hefty tip he could get me to my destination before dinner started&sup1; &sup2;.</p>
<p>Dinner was with Rich, his wife Karmann, and seven other couples. In a private room.</p>
<p>I felt a little bad because I think I outbid M3 Sweatt for my spot, and M3 is&nbsp;a guy who just a few eeks later said stuff about me like this on Twitter:</p>
<p><a title="There's no 'I' in IDN, part 6: It isn't like there's an 'I' in EAI, either!" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2011/07/14/10186414.html"><img style="max-width: 550px;" border="0" alt="" src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/2555.m3tweet.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Hopefully he'll be able to forgive me eventually!</p>
<p>I called Cathy&nbsp;a few weeks prior, and she was willing to ignore the fact that we'd be out late on a Thursday to be my +1 when the original +1 proved unavailable. She even made it there before I did, actually!</p>
<p>And Jenny was there&nbsp;too, with her husband. I was surprised since she wasn't on the original list (they got to sub or another couple who had&nbsp;a conflict. I was grateful since she was going to be the next person asked if Cathy couldn't make it, and&nbsp;if that had happened, I wouldn't have met her husband!</p>
<p>Altogether, the seven couples raised $3,820 -- which Rich and Karmann were going to match over&nbsp;and above the Giving Campaign matching, and donate it to the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, where they are on the Ambassadors&rsquo; Board.</p>
<p>He also noticed my&nbsp;name on the guest list for the Fred Hutch Gala, and we talked about that for a bit (he got me&nbsp;a seat&nbsp;at a&nbsp;"Softies" table for the event, which was coming up in just a couple of&nbsp;days. :-)</p>
<p>And of course the amazing dinner on that night a Canlis.</p>
<p>I'll put up the menu to&nbsp;get you&nbsp;ll jealous!</p>

<p>Yum!!!!!</p>
<p>I also conveyed greetings from Marlena and Barbara who I had recently taken my leave of.</p>
<p>Several people were amused at the schedule I set myself up for that day, not that I had much choice....</p>
<p>In the end, this was the&nbsp;single most impressive December 1st of the 41 I've experienced in my lifetime thus far.</p>
<p>I may retire December 1st's jersey at this point!</p>
<p>The evening an thie particular Exec and his wife provided something that&nbsp;was more than anything else&nbsp;about the spirit of camaraderie&nbsp;and&nbsp;generosity .</p>
<p>And a very tangible (and delicious!) reward for it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

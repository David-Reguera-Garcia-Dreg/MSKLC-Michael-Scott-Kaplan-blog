<p>The other day, in&nbsp;response to <strong><a title="Got Windows 8? Check out the Multilingual App Toolkit!" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2012/03/09/10280309.html">Got Windows 8? Check out the Multilingual App Toolkit!</a></strong>, regular reader John Cowan commented:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>qps-ploc???&nbsp; Private-use script tags are Qaaa-Qabx.</em></p>
<p>I was very focused on the language part of the tag so I explained the language tag was valid. And John countered:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>Yes, 'qps' is a private primary language tag, that's fine.&nbsp; But the 'ploc' part is an unassigned, non-private, script tag.&nbsp; That steps on ISO 15924.&nbsp; 'qps-qaap' would have been appropriate.</em></p>
<p>Yep, that's true.</p>
<p>And there was even a time that I cared about this stuff a lot.</p>
<p>Like in February 2007, when I wrote <strong><a title="The name of the song is not 'ps-PS I Love You'" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/02/04/1596987.html">The name of the song is not 'ps-PS I Love You'</a></strong>, explaining how some people were lamely using <strong>ps-PS</strong> as the name for the&nbsp;pseudo locale.</p>
<p>And how the NLS team created&nbsp; three pseudo locales that did not trample on ISO-639 and ISO-3166 quite as much:</p>
<ul>
<li>qps-ploc</li>
<li>qps-mirr</li>
<li>qps-asia</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Too bad no one noticed this problem back then, huh? They were just in Vista <strong>beta</strong> at the time, and no one was using them yet except in testing. Thousands of people viewed that blog, how come no one ever complained? </em>:-(</p>
<p>Well, on the positive side, they do not step on either the language codes of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639">ISO-639</a> or the country codes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166">ISO-3166</a>.</p>
<p>On the negative side, as John mentioned&nbsp;it steps all over the script codes of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_15924">ISO-15924</a>.</p>
<p>Crap.</p>
<p>Plus, it's weird anyway to think of any of those three suffixes as being "script" codes. Since they refer to attributes that are obviously not so much about script, you know?</p>
<p>They're really language variants.</p>
<p>Yet I have trouble getting too worked up about it.</p>
<p>I mean, it matters, sure.</p>
<p>But I could perhaps argue that they are really rogue <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-6">ISO-639-6</a> codes, arrived at by misunderstanding the way that standard replaces the 639 value with a four-letter code....</p>
<p>That sounds convincingly plausible, right? :-)</p>
<p>Oh, never mind. I wouldn't believe it,&nbsp;so I can't expect you to.</p>
<p>Someone should just&nbsp;fix those freaking codes.</p>
<p>The incorrect codes offered by the NLS team years ago to make up for the other incorrect codes!</p>
<p>Oh well, some day....</p>
<p>In the meantime, I'm not going to lose too much sleep over it. Conflicts are pretty unlikely....</p>
<hr/><p><strong>John Cowan</strong> on 20 Mar 2012 1:25 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>You have mentioned qps-ploc in passing twice before, in &quot;Seeing double? You&#39;re not drunk; you&#39;re just running pseudo!&quot; and &quot;LOCALE_SDECIMAL? Quite a character! Or two. Or three...&quot; &nbsp;If I&#39;d noticed it in either of these, I would have complained. &nbsp;But it&#39;s not mentioned in &quot;The name of the song is not &#39;ps-PS I Love You&#39;&quot;, which evidently predates it. &nbsp;The full explanation is only given in Shawn&#39;s blog at &quot;Pseudo Locales in Windows Vista Beta 2&quot;, but alas I don&#39;t read that.</p>

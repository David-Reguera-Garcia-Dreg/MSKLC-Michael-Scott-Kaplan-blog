</ul>
<p>Now it was in January 30 of last year that I wrote a specific blog.</p>
<p>A blog quite relevant to today,in fact</p>
<p>The blog in question: <a title="Even in India, the language is actually known as Bangla (not Bengali)" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2011/01/30/10121996.html">Even in India, the language is actually known as Bangla (not Bengali)</a>.</p>
<p>Especially the part at the end:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;">I figure the first step is to ask the question. So in the hopes that a few of those 55 million Bangla speakers in India are reading this or have been pointed to it by friends what they think of the two language packs, compared....</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><strong>And yes, I think both locale names in English should be updated to Bangla in future versions of Windows either way.</strong></p>
<p>And then what friend Omi Azad just wrote on Facebook:</p>
<p><a href="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/2260.Bangla01.jpg"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://blogs.msdn.com/resized-image.ashx/__size/550x0/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-33-81/2260.Bangla01.jpg" /></a></p>
<p><em>The number of <strong>Like</strong>s is much higher now, of course!</em></p>
<p>Now I don't want to imply that I have the power to have accomplished this.</p>
<p>Arbitrarily.</p>
<p>On my own.</p>
<p>And without oversight.</p>
<p>Because I don't.</p>
<p>And I wouldn't.</p>
<p>And I didn't.</p>
<p>And I can't.</p>
<p>But we have received a <strong>lot</strong> of feedback from customers and native speakers that this is the case -- that all early feedback helped contribute to the investigation, which helped to handle the situation.</p>
<p>It was truly a pleasure to be involved on this longstanding issue.</p>
<p>Which I suppose leaves the <strong><a title="Bengali vs. Kamrupi?" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2011/08/08/10193466.html">Bengali vs. Kamrupi?</a></strong> crowd still unhappy, but then the Assamese don't want the&nbsp;<strong>Assamese</strong> language name changed to Kamrupi in Microsoft products; they want the term <strong>Bengali</strong> changed in Unicode character names to <strong>Kamrupi</strong>. Which we can't do.</p>
<p>I'm less pleased about not having any way to help them, but they didn't give me (or Unicode) many (or even any)&nbsp;options.</p>
<p><strong>I mean, LIPs do not get to localize the character names in CHARMAP.EXE (discussed in <a title="If you have to ask 'How do I say ____ in ____ language?' then maybe you shouldn't!" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2012/02/07/10264760.html">If you have to ask "How do I say ____ in ____ language?" then maybe you shouldn't!</a>), so "deciding" to "fix" that issue in the LIP&nbsp;would be&nbsp;a complicated issue.</strong></p>
<p>And who knows if the localizers would agree with the <strong>Kamrupi</strong> issue anyway; it is a contentious one, and&nbsp;a hard one to get objective responses on.</p>
<p>We (and I) will&nbsp;have to&nbsp;be satisfied with what we (and I)&nbsp;<strong>can</strong> do, since&nbsp;neither we (nor I) will be able to please everybody....</p>

<p>We already have people saying Farsi instead of Persian, though the Academy of Persian Language and Literature is against it. &nbsp;What next, Deutsch as the English name of German?</p>

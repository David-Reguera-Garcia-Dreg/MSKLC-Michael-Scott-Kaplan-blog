<p>Here we go again, right?</p>
<p>(Cue recycled Reuters image)</p>

<p>As the article&nbsp;mentioned:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">The lira design was the winner of more than 8,000 entries in a public competition, some of them, Erdogan (centre) pointed out, from prisoners. He depicted the new symbol as a natural progression from previous changes, including lopping off six zeros from the currency in 2005 and dropping the designation &ldquo;new Turkish lira&rdquo; three years ago.</span></p>
<p>I remember some of those previous gyrations; perhaps you do as well...</p>
<p>I tend to blame the Euro for this of events. If the Euro had never been invented, we might not have to keep dealing with this sort of thing.</p>
<p>I didn't feel eager. Or hopeful</p>
<p>I just felt tired.</p>
<p>Thinking about the past.</p>
<p>Like those new Turkish lira coins, the one that looked and felt so much like 2 Euro coins that it fooled vending&nbsp;machines.</p>
<p>And t wasn't the small difference like between US and Canadian quarters last decade..</p>
<p>In this case, every time you got a machine to take the Turkish coin you made a 400% profit.</p>
<p>Maybe, perhaps,&nbsp;I am being too harsh here, though.</p>
<p>I don't want to get all negative about Turkey here.</p>
<p>Technically the 9th most exciting night of my life happened mere hours after a Jethro Tull show about two decades ago (a part of their A Little Light Music tour). And not just because of the cat I didn't sneak in. She was just glad to see me again.</p>
<p>But pleasant memories aren't enough to get me interested in the latest flashy plan to revitalize the Turkish Lira.</p>
<p>I'm not going to be holding onto extra Liras any time soon.</p>
<p>I still have&nbsp;some Liras and New Liras that are never going to be worth anything.</p>
<p>For now, I'm just gonna roll away and not think about that night. I'll leave the new Lira alone until I'm asked to do something with it.</p>
<p>Maybe I'm just getting old....</p>

They have an expiration period of 10 years, which should be more than enough to redeem them.</p>

<p><strong>Doug Ewell</strong> on 14 Mar 2012 9:46 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>New currency symbols don&#39;t &quot;rival&quot; existing symbols for other currencies, and they don&#39;t confer some sort of additional stability or world prominence onto the currency. They make it easier and less ambiguous to write amounts in that currency. Someone needs to do a better job communicating this.</p>

<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 14 Mar 2012 8:56 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>I agree, Doug - though Turkey seems unconvinced!</p></div>
<p><strong>Doug Ewell</strong> on 15 Mar 2012 2:30 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>India seemed unconvinced a couple of years ago, too. I wonder if anything has changed.</p>

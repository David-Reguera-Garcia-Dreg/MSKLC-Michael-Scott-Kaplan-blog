<h1>Renée Fleming -- easy on the eyes, the ears, the heart, and the soul. We were [willingly] taken in....</h1>

<p>The symphony inspires beautiful things for me -- even when unrealistic things are inspired, their beauty and majesty can still trip me up every time.</p>
<p>Like the Wolfgang (Seattle Symphony's Young Patrons Group) kickoff party for this last season.</p>
<p>It was at the Columbia Tower Club (which I should join since I am there so much but I am invited to enough events that I doubt I'd be there more often if I was a member!)</p>
<p>We got to meet the new musical director (Ludovic Morlot!).</p>
<p>And there was a truly amazing happening there.</p>
<p>Two Symphony musicians (one wind, one strings) each played a particular piece for their respective instruments.</p>
<p>Standard fare, that.</p>
<p>And then they did something amazing.</p>
<p>They played each other's pieces, with the "wrong" instruments.</p>
<p>Now any artist who makes it to Benaroya Hall is a cut above.</p>
<p>But the ability to intentionally play in a way that emphasizes a piece in a way that a mere admirer of Symphony can spot the similarities between when the piece is played with the "right" instruments and the "wrong" ones, both?</p>
<p>I admit I was originally there for the free food and wine.</p>
<p>After the performance, I was so enamored of what I had witnessed that I&nbsp;got seasons tickets for Wolfgang, along with my similarly inspired friend Lauren</p>
<p>Now neither of us was so naive that we failed to see that performance as anything more than a stunt, and one that could not be realistically done with the full orchestra in any show we were going to watch.</p>
<p>But I doubt either of us cared, really.</p>
<p>We had just witnessed something so unexpected, so creative, that it drew us in.</p>
<p>Over the course of the next 6-7 months, we ended up at the four Wolfgang shows, each time inspired by some&nbsp;beautiful and&nbsp;innovative selections.</p>
<p>I never once felt cheated by the clever trick that so readily seduced. Ludovic Morlot proved himself over and over again.</p>
<p>The last of the four performances was just days ago, and it included The Frescoes of Piero della Francesca, which was essentially music inspired by art.</p>
<p>And Morlot showed us the Frescoes that inspired the movements.</p>
<p>I was once again amazed. And enamored of the music. The artistry. The pageantry.</p>
<p>Three things happened as a result of that amazing performance</p>
<p><strong>First of all</strong>, I was so tongue-tried trying to describe what the night did for me that the serious question "Michael, are you on Vicodin?" was asked.</p>
<p><em>I wasn't, by the way!</em></p>
<p><strong>Second of all</strong>, I decided to renew the Wolfgang subscription.</p>
<p><em>I wanted to be inspired again!</em></p>
<p><strong>And third of all</strong>, we did an add-on show:</p>
<p><a href="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/4812.ReneeFleming.jpg"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://blogs.msdn.com/resized-image.ashx/__size/550x0/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-33-81/4812.ReneeFleming.jpg" width="275" height="460" /></a></p>
<p>The beautiful and inestimable <strong>Ren&eacute;e Fleming</strong> sang with such beauty and grace and charm that&nbsp;we found ourselves waiting in line for an autograph, content to wait as long as it took!</p>
<p>And there was one more surprise that this show held.</p>
<p>We were sitting in the "orchestra" section, in the back on the ground floor (accessible seats, as I was in the iBot!).</p>
<p>But then at the last minute, we were "upgraded" to the Founder's Tier, near the stage. And we had the opportunity to see and hear the beautiful <strong>Ren&eacute;e Fleming</strong>, up close and personal.</p>
<p>We both agreed that we have been "ruined" from our formerly naive state where any seat seemed roughly liked any other.</p>
<p>Those Wolfgang seats will likely have similar placement, after the inspiring experience of being so close to <strong>Ren&eacute;e</strong>.</p>
<p>I mean,&nbsp;everyone knows how Thomas Jefferson&nbsp;talked about how we hold some truths to self-evident.</p>
<p>But&nbsp;<strong>Ren&eacute;e</strong><strong> Fleming</strong> singing the Declaration of Independence -- more stunning than any hymn or aria could ordinarily aspire to be -- would put the young&nbsp;(at the time he wrote the words practically younger than us now) Thomas Jefferson to rethink the meaning of self evident truths!</p>
<p>Again, neither of us is naive enough to think that each of next season's <strong>five</strong> performances will have someone as beautiful and talented as Ren&eacute;e Fleming singing in every, or possibly any, show.</p>
<p>However, neither of us cared -- suddenly being that much closer wasn't a luxury -- it was a nuance that almost felt like necessity, in case there was any opportunity to be once again delighted -- nay, inspired and enamored -- by any aspect of the performance we might miss if we were sitting less proximally!</p>
<p>I can't help wondering whether the person who upgraded our "accessible" seats knew what the impact would be.</p>
<p>All I can say is that (if he did realize it): well played, Patrick. Well played.... :-)</p>

<p>Wait, what? &nbsp;You found the playing of pieces on different instruments novel enough to emphasize, but putting the Declaration of Independence to music just gets a casual mention? &nbsp;Or is this a known thing that I&#39;m just not aware of?</p>

<p>Long time friend and reader of this Blog Mihai asked over in the Suggestion Box:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">Playing with Win 8 recently, and it looks like the rich edit controls now support spell-checking out of the box (ok, you have to set IMF_SPELLCHECKING).</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">Hooray!!!</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">But that is not exposed as a service in Extended Linguistic Service.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">No so hooray :-(</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">Can we hope that "the glue" will be in place by RC? Or GM?</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">Most likely you are not allowed to tell :-)</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">But can you (maybe) pass the message that exposing spelling as an ELS would be the nice (right?) thing to do?</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">Thank you,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">Mihai</span></p>
<p>I should admit something.</p>
<p>Something that although I'm fairly certain Mihai knows, there may be others who do not.</p>
<p>While at first glance it may seem that I have been sharing tons of things -- in all but fact announcing features of Windows 8, the truth is far less interesting.</p>
<p>Generally I don't mind the implicit out of control, bad boy, living&nbsp;on the edge&nbsp;image of a blogger who is a&nbsp;<strong>Rebel Without a Clause</strong>&sup1;.</p>
<p>But I can't really claim such a title.</p>
<p>What I talk about here is either important stuff to the PTB&sup2;&nbsp;that has been announced, or stuff that isn't important to the PTB&sup2; that they don't mind being out there.</p>
<p>Sometimes I doubt the PTB&sup2; even notice.</p>
<p>Other times it's stuff that the PTB&sup2; ask me to say something about. Though if you know me, you'll know I have no problem saying <strong>no way</strong> if I'm not interested; luckily for them it's relatively&nbsp;easy to catch my eye!</p>
<p>In this particular case there are a few things I know that may or may not be relevant:</p>
<ul>
<li>RichEdit is produced by one of the many groups that are basically within Office;</li>
<li>The spell checkers are (I think) produced by another group that is basically within Office;</li>
<li>The support within the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb788040(v=vs.85).aspx">EM_SETLANGOPTIONS</a>/<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb788040(v=vs.85).aspx">EM_GETLANGOPTIONS</a> messages of IMF_SPELLCHECKING is pretty cool;</li>
<li>ELS doesn't specifically document spelling services, though I do recall it being mentioned as a potential future direction.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have no idea what the plans are here, Mihai. :-)</p>
<p>Potentially I could forward it on, but I am reasonably certain that they are already planning on doing it or they aren't; it is way too late to just drop everything and add the feature in.</p>
<p>Though I admit it would be cool....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr/><p><strong>Quppa</strong> on 28 Mar 2012 10:14 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Is the new system-wide spell check currently limited to the RichEdit control and WinRT TextBox/RichEditBox controls? Making it available through ELS would be neat.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Mihai</strong> on 29 Mar 2012 2:35 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Oh, there was really no intention to &quot;lure&quot; you into disclosing anything :-)</p>
<p>Maybe just hoping that the info is out there, but in some places that I don&#39;t visit.</p>
<p>&quot;ELS doesn&#39;t specifically document spelling services&quot;</p>
<p>True. But it has a way to enumerate the available services (MappingGetServices).</p>
<p>And that does not find anything about spelling.</p>
<p>&quot;I do recall it being mentioned as a potential future direction&quot;</p>
<p>Well, it was something I thought it would be cool, when I have evaluated ELS before Win 7 got out.</p>
<p>But I hope you heard something more recently, and maybe someone who might make it happen :-)</p>
<p>Well, you should not say what are not allowed to say (or you don&#39;t know :-)</p>
<p>But thanks for the answer,</p>
<p>Mihai</p></div>

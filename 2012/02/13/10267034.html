<p>Over six years ago, on Wednesday, February 9th, 2005, I blogged the blog in this Blog entitled <strong><a title="What is the difference between Big Endian and Little Endian Unicode?" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2012/02/10/369958.html">What is the difference between Big Endian and Little Endian Unicode?</a></strong>.</p>

<p>About&nbsp;six years and one day later, on Friday, February 10th, 2012, Diane posed a question in a comment to that blog:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;"><em>How can I open a file once I have saved it as unicode big endian?</em></span></p>
<p>The short answer is to just open it the normal way!</p>
<p>If you are using Notepad or Wordpad or Word or&nbsp;several other programs, they will all detect the BYTE ORDER MARK (BOM) that Notepad inserts at the beginning of the file, and they will open it!</p>
<p>But let's assume there is more to this one....</p>
<p>For&nbsp;example,&nbsp;if Diane is a programmer trying to open the file, it becomes slightly more complicated of course -- one's best choice involves opening it using&nbsp;the .NET <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.text.unicodeencoding.aspx">UnicodeEncoding class</a> with one of the two constructors that tells people to expect Big-Endian Unicode, and the second best choice involves opening the file in binary mode and swapping the bytes.</p>
<p>I suppose I could take the opportunity Diane's question affords me to travel back in time to the pre-Windows 2000 days, and wax nostalgically to be present during the original conversations where they decided to expand that dialog to support three kinds of Unicode, and so on. I could ask Chris Walker, he'd give me the skinny here, maybe tell me the real story about what happened in 98-99 that led to adding both UTF-8 and UTF-16 BE. :-)</p>

<p>It&#39;d be cool if there&#39;s a way to manually selecting the open file code page too.</p>
<p>Btw, I just realized UTF16LE and UTF16BE aren&#39;t selectable code page in Internet Explorer, is there any reason for those codepage be leaved out from selection?</p>

</ul>
<p>Remember that third rule I mentioned in Part 0?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>I have neither inclination nor desire to violate either non-disclosure agreements or marketing news cycles related to Windows 8.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This last rule seems obvious, but I don't want anyone to misunderstand my intent here, or what I want to accomplish. Any time I talk about stuff you haven't heard before, it is only due the fact that they are doing other things right now, not because I am disclosing anything that you couldn't have found yourself by spelunking through the //Build Developer Preview, or eventually the Beta.</p>
<p>This blog you are reading today will in no way violate this rule!</p>
<p>Now of the many blogs above, for some it was <strong><a title="Part 5 (...until the decision was made to not refuse to add it)" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2011/11/08/10234995.html">Part&nbsp;5</a></strong> that was the most interesting.</p>
<p>Because it listed the locales that were scheduled to be added in Windows 8.</p>
<p>That list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Central Kurdish (Arabic) - Iraq</li>
<li>Cherokee (Cherokee) - United States</li>
<li>Fulah (Latin) - Senegal</li>
<li>Hawaiian - United States</li>
<li>Punjabi (Arabic) - Pakistan</li>
<li>Setswana - Botswana</li>
<li>Sindhi (Arabic) - Pakistan</li>
<li>Tamil - Sri Lanka</li>
<li>Tigrinya - Ethiopia</li>
<li>Tigrinya - Eritrea</li>
<li>Valencian - Spain</li>
</ul>
<p>That list was for locales, not UI languages, as I said.</p>
<p>So it was nominally listing items that were to be added to <strong>Table 3 (Locales whose identifiers are not directly associated with any localizations of Windows, even if a related identifier might make for one representing a suitable localization)</strong>&nbsp;of <strong><a title="The Locales of Windows 7, all divvied up" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2011/05/24/10167604.html">The Locales of Windows 7, all divvied up</a></strong>.</p>
<p><em>As initially reported in the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/">Building Windows 8</a> Blog a short time ago, in a blog entitled <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2012/02/21/using-the-language-you-want.aspx">Using the Language You Want</a>.</em></p>
<p>So I have bad news,&nbsp;worse&nbsp;news, and really good news!</p>
<p>The bad news will get you mad at me for over-promising and under-delivering. The worse news will get you mad at Microsoft for removing features. And the really good news will make you realize that I was just playing with your emotions!</p>
<p>The bad news: Many of those locales will not in fact be added to <strong>Table 3 (Locales whose identifiers are not directly associated with any localizations of Windows, even if a related identifier might make for one representing a suitable localization)</strong>.</p>
<p>The worse news: Even some of the locales that used to be in <strong>Table 3 (Locales whose identifiers are not directly associated with any localizations of Windows, even if a related identifier might make for one representing a suitable localization)</strong>. will be removed in Windows 8.</p>
<p>And the really good news: Every locale discussed earlier will actually be added to&nbsp;<strong>Table 2 (The locales representing languages for which Windows creates Language Interface Packs, aka LIPs)</strong> and occasionally even&nbsp;<strong>Table 1 (The locales representing languages into which Windows localizes)</strong> in Windows 8!</p>
<p>The official list of planned Windows 8 User Interface language additions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>en-GB</strong> aka&nbsp;English (United Kingdom)</li>
<li><strong>pa-Arab-PK</strong>&nbsp;aka Punjabi (Islamic Republic of Pakistan)</li>
<li><strong>sd-Arab-PK</strong> aka Sindhi (Islamic Republic of Pakistan)</li>
<li><strong>ku-Arab-IQ</strong> aka Central Kurdish (Iraq)</li>
<li><strong>ug-CN</strong> aka Uyghur (People's Republic of China)</li>
<li><strong>be-BY</strong> aka Belarusian - Belarus</li>
<li><strong>rw-RW</strong> aka Kinyarwanda - Rwanda</li>
<li><strong>ti-ET</strong> aka Tigrinya - Ethiopia</li>
<li><strong>tg-Cyrl-TJ</strong> aka Tajik - Tajikistan</li>
<li><strong>wo-SN</strong> aka Wolof - Senegal</li>
<li><strong>qut-GT</strong> aka K'iche - Guatemala</li>
<li><strong>gd-GB</strong> aka Scottish Gaelic - United Kingdom</li>
<li><strong>chr-Cher-US</strong> aka Cherokee (Cherokee, United States)</li>
<li><strong>ca-ES-valencia</strong> aka Valencian - Valencia</li>
</ul>
<p>I am going to pretend for a moment that is not amazing or incredible, okay?</p>
<p>Oh, screw that. I can't even pretend to be calm and dignified here.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="font-size: x-large;">This is amazing and in-freaking-credible!</span></strong></span></p>
<p>In future blogs, I will dig in further to many of the exciting, interesting, and cool technical/linguistic/cultural issues that have come up here in the process of all of this very cool and&nbsp;interesting work.</p>
<p>And the awesome new story of Language Pack installation that finally fixes the problems some users have noticed since Windows 2000!</p>
<p>And the new UI paradigm!</p>
<p>Not to mention the coolness of an en-GB User Interface language in Windows 8 that is just begging to tell more!</p>
<p>Plus all of the other cool stuff the announcement over in the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/">Building Windows 8</a> blog <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2012/02/21/using-the-language-you-want.aspx">Using the Language You Want</a>.</p>
<p>And all of the cool&nbsp;stuff about the Consumer Preview that you can try out yourself once you get your hands on it! :-)</p>
<p>But for now let me close with a personal note to Roy Bonny&nbsp;(ᎧᏂᎦ ᎪᎳᎭ) and Joseph Erb&nbsp;of Cherokee Nation: no more secrets, the President of Windows put the information into his Blog! :-)</p>
<hr/><p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 21 Feb 2012 7:25 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>The comments on the SteveSi blog are already going strong, check them out if you&#39;re curious. </p>
<p>And feel free to post here if you are afraid of getting lost in the list, of course! :-)</p>

<p><strong>John Cowan</strong> on 21 Feb 2012 8:56 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Well, the Valencian localization was cheap enough to provide, I&#39;m sure: just s/Catala/Valencia/ in suitable places!</p>

<p><strong>Quppa</strong> on 22 Feb 2012 9:27 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Great to see en-GB at last.</p>
<p>Can you share any information about the licensing story? Will display language switching still be limited to the high-end SKUs? The B8 post mentions selling en-GB as boxed software.</p>

<p>I&#39;d love to hear about the improvements to the Segoe UI font family in Windows 8. I noticed that the Light variant has been hinted at various sizes and that characters and glyphs have been added to all variants, particularly Segoe UI Symbol:</p>

<p>I remember talking to Mark Zbikowski a couple of times when he was still at Microsoft.</p>
<p>Once was to get his opinion on updating the casing table, which had by that point grown to over 200 letter pairs missing from it that were assigned in Unicode.</p>
<p>And the other time was to report a bug (previously described in <strong><a title="Ā was unexpected at this time" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/01/30/519760.html">Ā was unexpected at this time</a></strong>).</p>

<p>Afterwards, I asked him how he dealt with a problem I was starting to have more and more often which he seemed to be dealing with quite deftly....</p>
<p>The problem with people who consider you to be "the guy" in an area, who will use whatever answer you give as the one true gospel.</p>
<p>His answer is one I have kept with me, one of the greatest lessons I've learned during all of my time at Microsoft.</p>
<p>Is it that the person asking the question often has the information they need&nbsp;(or are very close to having it), and the most important thing you can do is help bring them to the answer they already have (or are very close to having).</p>
<p>Bold pronouncements or admonitions, eveb when they are&nbsp;needed,&nbsp;should be based on limited statements that are basically always true -- and that it is just the situational application of those truths becomes the big content&nbsp;of the mail. Of narly every mail.</p>
<p>I remember I felt some doubt about whether that would necessarily work for me, as I was still searching for&nbsp;my "always true" truths.</p>
<p>Though I feel much less of that now, just a few years later.</p>
<p>So these days, I pay much more attention to what he was trying to tell me then.</p>
<p>I mean, here will always be questions, always be new situations that people are looking to fit into the grand tapestry that we all think of as</p>
<p><span style="font-size: xx-large;">The Truth&trade;</span></p>
<p>I'm probably as smart as&nbsp;I always was, though I&nbsp;think of myself as being a little bit wiser now....</p>
<p>By the way, if I ever did write a book again, you just got the advance notice of what the title would be, didn't you?</p>
<p>It would be the title of this very blog you are reading, ;published two hours and ten minutes after even the regular readers expected it....</p>

<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong>: "We have nothing&nbsp;more/new to tell you, but we'll keep you posted."</p>
<p>One thing is obvious -- they're really wanting someone to step up here. They clearly are feeling defensive about pulling out, and they are quite ready to stop being the villain....</p>

At least they seem to be honestly sorry about putting all their clients out - what I remember of other companies in the same position (though obviously in less close relationships with their customers!) is a fair bit more along the lines of &quot;hey heres the legally required notice that we&#39;re closing and also remember you can&#39;t sue us about this&quot; (in their favor is the fact they probably have bigger problems right then than keeping customers happy!)</p>
<p>This sort of situation tends to result in some level of 3rd-party parts &amp; maintenance, and support to a lesser degree - though I&#39;m not sure if the market needs to be of some minimal size for that to happen. I&#39;m sure *someone* will be happy to take your money though!</p>
<p>PS: Man, that logo sure looks familiar....</p>

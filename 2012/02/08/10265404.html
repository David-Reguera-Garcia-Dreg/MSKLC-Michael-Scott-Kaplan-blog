<p>The other day in <strong><a title="Sometimes MMM is MMMM, other times MMM is M! (aka Not all abbreviations are created equal)" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2012/02/03/10263576.html">Sometimes MMM is MMMM, other times MMM is M! (aka Not all abbreviations are created equal)</a></strong>, I included a table of data from <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd317787.aspx">Day, Month, Year, and Era Format Pictures</a>:</p>
<table border="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>d</td>
<td>Day of the month as digits without leading zeros for single-digit days.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>dd</td>
<td>Day of the month as digits with leading zeros for single-digit days.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ddd</td>
<td>Abbreviated day of the week as specified by a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd373831.aspx">LOCALE_SABBREVDAYNAME*</a>value, for example, "Mon" in English (United States).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>dddd</td>
<td>Day of the week as specified by a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd373839.aspx">LOCALE_SDAYNAME*</a> value.</td>

<tr>

<td>Month as digits without leading zeros for single-digit months.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>MM</td>
<td>Month as digits with leading zeros for single-digit months.</td>

<tr>

<td>Abbreviated month as specified by a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd373831.aspx">LOCALE_SABBREVMONTHNAME*</a> value, for example, "Nov" in English (United States).</td>

<tr>
<td>MMMM</td>
<td>Month as specified by a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd373856.aspx">LOCALE_SMONTHNAME*</a> value, for example, "November" for English (United States), and "Noviembre" for Spanish (Spain).</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I kind of left something out of&nbsp;the<strong>&nbsp;ddd</strong> line.</p>
<p>The actual stuff in the topic was more like this:</p>
<table border="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>ddd</td>
<td>Abbreviated day of the week as specified by a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd373831.aspx">LOCALE_SABBREVDAYNAME*</a>value, for example, "Mon" in English (United States). <br /><br /> <strong>Windows Vista and later</strong>: If a short version of the day of the week is required, your application should use the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd373890.aspx">LOCALE_SSHORTESTDAYNAME*</a> constants.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>However, I felt like this information was very very weirdly placed, in a topic about <strong>format pictures</strong>.</p>
<p>I mean, they can't ever be used that way, something I have talked about previously in <strong><a title="We call 'em ShortestDayNames for a reason; they're as short as they're EVER gonna be!" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2011/12/30/10251957.html">We call 'em ShortestDayNames for a reason; they're as short as they're EVER gonna be!</a></strong> and <strong><a title="{recycled joke here} It could have been called LOCALE_SSINGLESERVINGDAYNAME*" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2011/01/27/10120308.html">{recycled joke here} It could have been called LOCALE_SSINGLESERVINGDAYNAME*</a></strong>, which give the reasoning for why the shortest day names were created and why they had no format picture abbreviation.</p>
<p>I don't object to the docs trying to bridge the distance here, but it feels pretty much like&nbsp;a "<strong>Bridge to Nowhere</strong>" since none of the information that a developer trying to use format pictures to build calendars would need to get conceptually to the shortest day names is actually there.</p>
<p>The reference there&nbsp;feels wrong -- like if they weren't going to explain the conceptual difference, then why mention it?</p>
<p>As it stands, an otherwise useful topic has this weird inserted bit.</p>
<p>I'd recommend taking it out -- the insert is weird and badly placed and awkward. We are forced to look past it since it doesn't really do anything useful for us....</p>
<p><strong>My vote? Take it out completely -- it has nothing to do with format pictures; why pretend otherwise?</strong></p>

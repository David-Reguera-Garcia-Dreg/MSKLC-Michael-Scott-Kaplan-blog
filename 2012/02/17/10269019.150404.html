<p>In the past, I have tended to be rather hostile toward Emoji.</p>
 <p>But there are some Emoji that I simply love, love, love.</p>
 <p>Like some of the ones friend/colleague Alexander Sklar mentioned over in Facebook yesterday:</p>
 <p><span style="font-family: segoe ui symbol;">üôà</span>&nbsp; U+1f648&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY</p>
 <p><span style="font-family: segoe ui symbol;">üôâ</span>&nbsp; U+1f649&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HEAR-NO-EVIL MONKEY</p>
 <p><span style="font-family: segoe ui symbol;">üôä</span>&nbsp; U+1f64a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SPEAK-NO-EVIL MONKEY</p>
 <p>Just in case you aren't reading this blog on your Windows 8 machine, here they are in Notepad on Windows 8:</p>

 <p>It's worth noting that font fallback was in full force - I never specified the font, but Wordpad/RichEdit had no problem finding the font!</p>
 <p>The&nbsp;origin of these three mystic apes -- originally named Mizaru (the one covering his eyes, who sees no evil),&nbsp;Kikazaru (the one&nbsp;covering his ears, who hears no evil), and&nbsp;Iwazaru (the one&nbsp;covering his mouth, who speaks no evil) -- are described in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_wise_monkeys#Origin">the Wikipedia article</a>:</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 90px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">The source that popularized this pictorial maxim is a 17th century carving over a door of the famous T≈çsh≈ç-g≈´ shrine in Nikk≈ç, Japan. The carvings at Toshogu Shrine were carved by Hidari Jingoro, and believed to have incorporated Confucius&rsquo;s Code of Conduct, using the monkey as a way to depict man&rsquo;s life cycle. There are a total of 8 panels, and the iconic three wise monkeys picture comes from panel 2. The philosophy, however, probably originally came to Japan with a Tendai-Buddhist legend, from China in the 8th century (Nara Period). It has been suggested that the figures represent the three dogmas of the so-called middle school of the sect.</span></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 90px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">In Chinese, a similar phrase exists in the Analects of Confucius from 2nd to 4th century B.C.: "Look not at what is contrary to propriety; listen not to what is contrary to propriety; speak not what is contrary to propriety; make no movement which is contrary to propriety" (ÈùûÁ¶ÆÂãøË¶ñÔºå ÈùûÁ¶ÆÂãøËÅΩÔºåÈùûÁ¶ÆÂãøË®ÄÔºå ÈùûÁ¶ÆÂãøÂãï). It may be that this phrase was shortened and simplified after it was brought into Japan.</span></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 90px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">It is through the K≈çshin rite of folk religion that the most significant examples are presented. The K≈çshin belief or practice is a Japanese folk religion with Chinese Taoism origins and ancient Shinto influence. It was founded by Tendai Buddhist monks in the late 10th century. A considerable number of stone monuments can be found all over the eastern part of Japan around Tokyo. During the later part of the Muromachi period, it was customary to display stone pillars depicting the three monkeys during the observance of K≈çshin.</span></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 90px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">Though the teaching had nothing to do with monkeys, the concept of the three monkeys originated from a simple play on words. The saying in Japanese is "mizaru, kikazaru, iwazaru" (Ë¶ã„Åñ„Çã, ËÅû„Åã„Åñ„Çã, Ë®Ä„Çè„Åñ„Çã, literally "don't see, don't hear, don't speak". However, -zaru, an archaic negative verb conjugation, is pronounced the same as zaru, the vocalized form of saru (Áåø?), "monkey", so the saying can also be interpreted as the names of three monkeys.</span></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 90px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">It is also possible that the three monkeys came from a more central root than a simple play on words.[contradiction] The shrine at Nikko is a Shinto shrine, and the monkey is an extremely important being in the Shinto religion. The monkey is believed to be the messenger of the Hie Shinto shrines, which also have connections with Tendai Buddhism. There are even important festivals that are celebrated during the year of the monkey (occurring every twelve years) and a special festival is celebrated every sixteenth year of the K≈çshin.</span></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 90px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"The Three Mystic Apes" (Sambiki Saru) were described as "the attendants of Saruta Hito no Mikoto or K≈çshin, the God of the Roads". The K≈çshin festival was held on the 60th day of the calendar. It has been suggested that during the K≈çshin festival, according to old beliefs, one&rsquo;s bad deeds might be reported to heaven "unless avoidance actions were taken&hellip;." It has been theorized that the three Mystic Apes, Not Seeing, Hearing, or Speaking, may have been the "things that one has done wrong in the last 59 days."</span></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 90px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">According to other accounts, the monkeys caused the Sanshi and Ten-Tei not to see, say or hear the bad deeds of a person. The Sanshi (‰∏âÂ∞∏) are three worms living in everyone's body. The Sanshi keep track of the good deeds and particularly the bad deeds of the person they inhabit. Every 60 days, on the night called K≈çshin-Machi (Â∫öÁî≥ÂæÖ), if the person sleeps, the Sanshi will leave the body and go to Ten-Tei (Â§©Â∏ù), the Heavenly God, to report about the deeds of that person. Ten-Tei will then decide to punish bad people, making them ill, shortening their time alive, and in extreme cases putting an end to their lives. Those believers of K≈çshin who have reason to fear will try to stay awake during K≈çshin nights. This is the only way to prevent the Sanshi from leaving their body and reporting to Ten-Tei.</span></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 90px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">An ancient representation of the 'no see, no hear, no say, no do' can be found in four golden figurines in the Zelnik Istvan Southeast Asian Gold Museum. These golden statues date from the 6th to 8th century. The figures look like tribal human people with not very precise body carvings and strong phallic symbols. This set indicates that the philosophy comes from very ancient roots.</span></p>
 <p>There is a fourth monkey, named Shizaru, the "DO-NO-EVIL MONKEY", which has been seen in two different forms:</p>
 <ul>
 <li>A "PG" form which his arms are crossed in front of himself, and</li>
 <li>A more vulgar "R" form in which hands are covering his genitals.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>That fourth monkey is not in many of the legends and stories, and it is not in Unicode either.</p>
 <p>If it were up to me, a space would have been reserved at U+1f64c for this fourth monkey, and if&nbsp;it was eventually added&nbsp;I would have been quite content to go with the PG version for the reference glyph</p>
 <p>Alas, no such luck.</p>
 <p><em>Perhaps it was an oblique criticism of Google's "Don't be evil" since there are so many people who question that it is really a guiding principle anymore -- so that's why Unicode chose to <strong>not</strong> "do no evil.":</em></p>
 <p>But this seems really unlikely to me (I wasn't the one who originally suggested it).</p>
 <p>Plus I don't want to violate the U+1f64a principle!</p>
 <p>Anyhow, the story, though originally Chinese, has a unique importance in Japanese culture, where these three figures embody the Golden Rule there, providing a moral center that is almost the opposite of the "ignoring immorality" that it often means in Western culture.</p>
 <p>But the cultural meanings in Japan are something that gives them a place in the Emoji... perhaps the three that redeem the whole set, in the eyes of some!</p>
 <p>On the other hand, trivializing them my offend some even more.</p>
 <p>But it serves, they serve, as a reminder that every character has a story.... :-)</p>

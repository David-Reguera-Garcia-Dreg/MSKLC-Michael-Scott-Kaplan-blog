<p>Speaking of user interface simplification&nbsp;changes in Windows 8....</p>
<p>Remember this one?</p>
<p><img src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/1373.condensed01.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></p>
<p>This is UI that &lt; 5% of all users ever launched, and &lt; 5% of that tiny group ever modified the settings.</p>
<p>And half of them undid the changes after that!</p>
<p>Really, they want this to be less common.</p>
<p>Thus the new default <strong>Match Windows Display Language (Recommended)</strong> setting.</p>
<p>Over here:</p>
<p><img src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/6567.condensed02.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></p>
<p>This UI shows a LOT of language stuff, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Windows display language in use;</li>
<li>Other available Windows display languages one can switch to;</li>
<li>The language of <strong>Date, time, and number formatting</strong> (aka the default user locale);</li>
<li>Any and all keyboards in use.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;There's more, but I can get into the rest some other time.</p>
<p>I have mixed feelings about this new user interface -- some good, and some bad.</p>
<p>How do others feel about it?</p>

<p>I&#39;m one of the 5%, of course. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s better or worse than being one of the 47%.</p>
<p>I still don&#39;t understand why the default U.S. long date format—the one you say 95% will bother to never change and another 2.5% will put back the way it was—uses &quot;dd&quot; for the day number. Who writes today&#39;s date as &quot;Friday, November 02, 2012&quot; with the leading zero? Anybody? &quot;Typical U.S. users,&quot; as the association with region implies?</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Doug Ewell</strong> on 2 Nov 2012 8:23 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Oh wait, there it is in English, several blogs down.</p>
<p>Anyway, the added convenience (or not) of these dialogs isn&#39;t for &quot;all users.&quot; It&#39;s for users who need to change their language settings more than once per OS release, and that&#39;s 5% at best. So focus on what those users prefer, and just channel your inner Mitt and don&#39;t worry about the other 95%.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>ErikF</strong> on 2 Nov 2012 8:26 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>I&#39;m one of those &lt;5% as well; I want to use English (Canada) but I hate the default date and time formats so change them right away to &quot;yyyy-MM-dd&quot; and &quot;HH:mm:tt&quot; for the short formats, and &quot;dd MMMM yyyy&quot; and &quot;HH:mm:tt&quot; for the long formats. Actually, it&#39;s interesting to note the programs that break when I do this; at work our ticketing system falls to pieces with my preferred date format!</p>
<p>(My pet peeve with the standard US and UK formats is that I can never tell at a glance what 02/11/2012 means. Is it 11 February or 2 November? But I realize that some things will never change and have come to grips with the fact that I&#39;ll be wrong 50% of the time.)</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Doug Ewell</strong> on 5 Nov 2012 8:00 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>@ErikF: so you do prefer the two-digit date (&#39;dd&#39;) with leading zero? Today is &quot;05 November 2012&quot; to you?</p>
</div>
<p><strong>ErikF</strong> on 7 Nov 2012 4:55 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>@Doug: Actually, I do. I find that it helps when I&#39;m scanning through long lists of dates (I don&#39;t have to concentrate very hard to distinguish between 1 and 10-19, for example.) I admit that my preferences are strange, but at least I have the ability to change the format, at least for most programs.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Doug Ewell</strong> on 8 Nov 2012 9:10 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>@ErikF: &quot;at least I have the ability to change the format, at least for most programs.&quot; Absolutely agree that those of us in the 5% should be able to customize things. (I use &#39;yyyy-MM-dd&#39; and &#39;H:mm:ss&#39;.) But I still suspect the leading zero is not what the 95% really prefer.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Matthew Slyman</strong> on 15 Apr 2013 9:47 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>When one selects &quot;Add an input method&quot;, one can see that the built-in keyboard layouts from Microsoft have been annotated with metadata about which general family of layouts they belong to (QWERTY, AZERTY, Dvorak etc.). Windows 8/ Office 2013 generally does a much better job at standardizing keyboard shortcuts across the platform than previous versions did (according to my testing the standardization appears to depend on this metadata).</p>
<p>I have been developing customized keyboard layouts using MSKLC 1.4 and the new KbdEdit Premium. Neither of these programs is able to add the layout family metadata, which instead appears as &quot;Keyboard&quot;. The shortcuts (as in previous versions of Windows and Office) are then inconsistent between applications, and totally unpredictable. As a key design objective of my layouts, they must be 100% compatible drop-in replacements of the existing US-Dvorak layout (only, with extra diacritics, accents, international/mathematical/scientific/currency/commercial symbols etc.; using dead keys extensively in a fairly logical method of character-composition).</p>
<p>My wife is mightily confused when she tries to hijack my development machine to look at recipes, only to find that I&#39;ve got my layout set to one of my experimental options rather than the built-in US-Dvorak layout where the Windows shortcuts work with my Dvorak-keycapped keyboard! Should I regard this &quot;security feature&quot; as a BENEFIT of not being able to set the metadata, or, is there a way to get my layouts into keyboard-layout-Nirvana? Neither me nor the friendly developer of KbdEdit have been able to find out this secret knowledge yet...</p>

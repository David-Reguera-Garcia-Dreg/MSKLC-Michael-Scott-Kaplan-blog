<p>Earlier this month, someone reached out to me on Twitter.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/KristoferA/status/265650612723662851" target="_blank"><img title="The tweet" src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/6685.burmese01.jpg" alt="The tweet" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Unfortunately for @KristoferA, I don't pay enough attention to my Twitter account!</p>
<p>Being in post-op rehab is no excuse.</p>
<p>This will be my 7,300th tweet, so maybe I should get better at this.</p>
<p>Sorry about that!</p>
<p>I think the ISO 639 code for Burmese is actually <span style="font-size: xx-large;"><strong>my</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Though I wouldn't recommend running over to .NET or Windows and trying <strong>my-MM</strong>, because the locale isn't supported.</p>
<p>We have lots of locales, to be sure.</p>
<p>But&nbsp;not that one.</p>
<p>Of course, we did add font, shaping, and keyboard support in Windows 8.</p>
<p>You can add it to the <strong>Language</strong> list, even, just by typing "Burmese" into&nbsp;the search box of the "Add language" dialog:</p>
<p><img title="Add the Burmese language?" src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/2818.burmese02.jpg" alt="Add the Burmese language?" border="0" /></p>
<p>If you add it, you'll get a fun surprise.</p>
<p>Check out the dialog:</p>
<p><img title="You get the Myanmar keyboard layout!" src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/5238.burmese03.jpg" alt="You get the Myanmar keyboard layout!" border="0" /></p>
<p>It knew to add the Myanmar keyboard layout.</p>
<p>Cool! :-)</p>
<p>So, no locale yet. But we started getting some support in.</p>
<p>The font is exquisite.</p>
<p>And the way everything came together to work here is kinda impressive.</p>
<p>There really was intent here to make a scenario work well, in a very integrated manner.</p>
<p>You would have to create a custom locale to come full circle and finish the job, but that too is an option.</p>
<p>Now I think that soon I'll give an example that doesn't show us in as flattering of a light.</p>
<p>Just so you don't start thinking we are <strong>too</strong> impressive. :-)</p>
<p>Stay tuned...</p>

<p>Thanks for replying. I didn&#39;t know you were in post-op rehab, hope your recovery is going well. Thanks for taking the time to research and blog about this despite that.</p>
<p>Let me give you a bit of background on why I asked: as you know, Burma/Myanmar is opening up for more business with the outside world, and a lot of countries and companies in the region (and worldwide) are paying more attention to Burma (including the first ever state visit to Burma by a US president when Obama and Clinton was there last week).</p>
<p>As a result of this, a client of mine is localizing their website for the Burmese market, so although I am not directly involved in that effort I was asked if I knew how to initialize a Burmese/Myanmar locale in .net. As you pointed out, that fails since .net don&#39;t yet have any support for that. However, as you also pointed out: a custom locale seems to do the trick, and the CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder class seems to be the key to handling it with a custom locale: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.globalization.cultureandregioninfobuilder(v=vs.100).aspx">msdn.microsoft.com/.../system.globalization.cultureandregioninfobuilder%28v=vs.100%29.aspx</a> .</p>
<p>Next, as it goes for fonts, it is great that it has been added to Win8. However, a lot of users (esp in a web setting) can be expected to use other platforms (ranging from XP to Win7, or Mac/Linux/etc). It turns out that Google has some nice web fonts that can be used for that purpose: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.google.com/webfonts/earlyaccess">www.google.com/.../earlyaccess</a> / <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://code.google.com/p/tharlon-font/">code.google.com/.../tharlon-font</a> , and of course it would be nice to see if Microsoft can maybe offer something similar by making the MSFT Burmese fonts available for download for Win7/XP/Vista as well...?</p>
<p>On a side-note: I came across something in a forum where someone complained that some glyphs in the Win8 burmese font were not 100% Unicode 5.x compatible. I will see if I can find that again, and will forward you the link.</p>
<p>Anyways, I hope that over the next few months we will see increased support for Burmese/Myanmar locale in different Microsoft products, including earlier Win versions and of course the .net framework. I am sure there are lots of companies eyeing the Burmese market right now, and having support for the language etc in Windows/IIS/ASP.net etc will definitely help...</p>
<p>Thanks again for the follow-up.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Kristofer</p>

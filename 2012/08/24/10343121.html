<p>Over in the Suggestion Box, Daniela Semeco asked:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">Hi Michael,</span></em><br />&nbsp;<br /><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">I have enjoyed reading your blog a great deal. I am inventor, and I'm looking for a keyboard device driver developer. Could you please recommend someone to me or suggest where to look? I've done what I could with MSKLC and KBDEdit, and I realize that this will not suffice. I need something to be written from scratch. I am in San Francisco and would like to hire someone in the Bay Area. I would feel more comfortable meeting them in person, especially since it involves intellectual property. I'm looking to have software developed for Windows, Mac and Linux OS, as well as for iPad and Android tablet. I would appreciate any feedback. Many thanks!</span></em><br />&nbsp;<br /><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">-<a href="mailto:danielasemeco@hotmail.com">Daniela</a></span></em></p>
<p>The landscape in this space is indeed bleak.</p>
<p>My first thought would have been Mark Durdin and <a href="http://www.tavultesoft.com/">Tavultesoft</a>, though despite his visits to the Bay Area and Seattle, he is still located in Australia.</p>
<p>He should be up here and down there&nbsp;in the near future if you wanted to meet, and I know he has dug deeper into the keyboard space than anyone outside of Microsoft than anyone I've ever known (and most of the people inside, too!).</p>
<p><em>He may reach out to you after seeing this blog, if not feel free to reach out to him....</em></p>
<p>Beyond that, I've been pretty unimpressed with others I've interacted with in this space.</p>
<p>And I've interacted with a <strong>lot</strong> of them over the years.</p>
<p>It's hard to say more without knowing more about what you're looking for; perhaps there are people who would be helpful in some specific area?</p>
<p>Or if you're at the <strong>Internationalization and Unicode Conference</strong> in Santa Clara in October (<a href="http://www.unicodeconference.org/">site</a>), you can see me there and tell me more....</p>

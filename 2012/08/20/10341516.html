<p>Back in the end of June, Todd Brix wrote a blog on the Windows Phone Developer Blog entitled <a href="http://windowsteamblog.com/windows_phone/b/wpdev/archive/2012/06/28/first-look-at-the-windows-phone-8-marketplace.aspx">First look at the Windows Phone 8 Marketplace</a>.</p>
<p>In it, there was a huge list of regions, covering large parts of the world.</p>
<p>180 places being covered by the AppHub and the Marketplace.</p>
<p>This is huge, as is the already announced news that Windows Phone 8 would be heavily using the Windows 8 core.</p>
<p>A core that includes the Windows 8 locale data!</p>
<p>The Windows Phone 8 team has on it many people who have been holding our feet to the fire as they had the combination of the joyful experience of more coverage and updated data with the painful experience of changes and even a few bugs.</p>
<p>But it was really amazing to work with them and partner with them here -- we are a better product because of the work they were doing as a part of their product....</p>
<p>One of the most frequent sources of werdness was inconsistencies between data fields that would reasonably be considered related -- like <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd373891">LOCALE_SSHORTTIME</a> and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd373896">LOCALE_STIMEFORMAT</a>.</p>
<p>In the end, when they were different it was just due to historical reasons, and the lack of anyone reviewing them for differences to date.</p>
<p>That kind of cleanup has started largely due to their diligence and reports, and further cleanup in the future will definitely take their issues into account.</p>
<p>Plus it is really cool to see these things on Windows Phone 8!</p>

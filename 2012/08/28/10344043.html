<p>So, it started yesterday.</p>
<p>With Jon Fullerton's question in <strong><a title="Cutting the cord, revisited -- and documenting how to get the job done!" href="../24/6631463.html">Cutting the cord, revisited -- and documenting how to get the job done!</a></strong>.</p>
<p>I answered it (as best as I could) in <strong><a title="When functions don't do what you want them to..." href="../27/10343714.html">When functions don't do what you want them to...</a></strong>.</p>
<p>I should have looked harder, though.</p>
<p>Because he also put something in the Suggestion Box!</p>
<p>Specifically, he asked:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">Michael,</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">It has been quite a while since the discussions on IME's, activating keyboard layouts, etc. I need to select a specific IME for a text box based upon a language selected by the user. I also need to position the Language bar so they can easily find it if they need to make changes. How about a topic on that addressing versions of Windows like Win 7 and Server 2008?</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">Thanks</span></em></p>
<p>Hmmm.</p>
<p>Well, to start, there is the big KLID/GUID list in <strong><a title="From KLID to GUID (aka KLIDoral stimulation, it feels GUID)" href="../27/9894707.html">From KLID to GUID (aka KLIDoral stimulation, it feels GUID)</a></strong>.</p>
<p>There are listed the IMEs and the languages they go with.</p>
<p>You can use <a title="InstallLayoutOrTip" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb847909">InstallLayoutOrTip</a> with any of those functions to install any one of them.</p>
<p>Assuming they are installed, you can start looking at <a title="EnumEnabledLayoutOrTip" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb847907">EnumEnabledLayoutOrTip</a> to see what is there.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you may be limited to using some calculations and a call&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a title="GetKeyboardLayoutList" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms646297">GetKeyboardLayoutList</a> and <a title="ActivateKeyboardLayout" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms646289">ActivateKeyboardLayout</a> to do the activation.</p>
<p>Messy.</p>
<p>A problem different from the ones I describe in <strong><a title="What a tangled web we weave when a KLID from an HKL we must receive" href="../../../2008/09/29/8968315.html">What a tangled web we weave when a KLID from an HKL we must receive</a></strong> and <strong><a title="What do you get when you put a Hebrew on top of a Russian? (aka What lies beneath can bite you on the ass)" href="../../../2008/10/01/8971160.html">What do you get when you put a Hebrew on top of a Russian? (aka What lies beneath can bite you on the ass)</a></strong>, but with the same cause nevertheless.</p>
<p>This really needs to be easier.</p>
<p>I guess one could dig into Cicero here somehow. But good luck trying to figure out how&nbsp;do that. ;-(</p>
<p>The simple rule that every developer needs to internalize:</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">"If it is easy, then there are samples. And if it's <strong>very</strong> easy, everyone is writing them."</span></p>
<p>Now Jon's last question, about how to position the Language Bar, is that you can't. It's for users to do themselves, not for developers to do (even at the behest of the user)...</p>

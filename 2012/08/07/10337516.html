<h1>ResolveLocaleName cleans up and flies right</h1>

<p>Regular readers may remember my <strong><a title="Four cases where I don't like ResolveLocaleName (and you shouldn't either!)" href="../../04/23/10296348.html">Four cases where I don't like ResolveLocaleName (and you shouldn't either!)</a></strong> from a few&nbsp;months ago.</p>
<p>I described a terrible sitation with <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd319112.aspx">ResolveLocaleName</a>.</p>
<p>Ths function, added in Windows 7, would do all of the following:</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>In</strong></td>
<td><strong>Out</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>en-Latn-AU</td>
<td>en-US</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>zh-Hant-TW</td>
<td>zh-HK</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>en-Cyrl-TT</td>
<td>en-US</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>en-CanYouBelieve-THISCRAP</td>
<td>en-US</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>and I pointed out how this function works. It works badly.</p>
<p>Well, one person took this to heart, my friend Brendan.</p>
<p>He entered a bug on this for Windows 8 (I was actually just looking at the Win7 repro but it was I guess in Win8 too!).</p>
<p>Anyhow, despite how late it was they did do a quick fix!</p>
<p>So, once you have RTM bits, the results are much more reasonable:</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>In</strong></td>
<td><strong>Out</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>en-Latn-AU</td>
<td>en-AU</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>zh-Hant-TW</td>
<td>zh-TW</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>en-Cyrl-TT</td>
<td>en-TT</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>en-CanYouBelieve-THISCRAP</td>
<td>en-US</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;Wow -- much bettter!</p>
<p>Now, we just need to port it to Wndows 7... ::-)</p>

My own algorithm actually does something slightly more advanced: it takes two SETS of language codes (one set, the permissible/available options for a particular URI; the other set, the permissible/desired options according to a website visitor&#39;s HTTP language preferences.) Using set theory and ordered trees, I combine the sets into an ordered list of language options. You can see the results, for example, at the foot of this page:</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="https://www.aaabit.com/products/bin-packing/">www.aaabit.com/.../bin-packing</a></p>
<p>Change the language options in your browser, and see which localization options you are offered! This is just Version 1 of my system. I&#39;m working on Version 2, which will work on simpler, tidier code; and give better results. I plan to publish my code &amp; algorithms, possibly as &quot;open-source code&quot;. Might pay this page another visit when I&#39;ve done it...</p>

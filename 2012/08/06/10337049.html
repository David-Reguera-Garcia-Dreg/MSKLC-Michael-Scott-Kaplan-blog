<p>So, the other day, I shared a picture on&nbsp;Facebook.</p>
<p>Nothing I haven't done before,</p>
<p>As usual, I was just sharing someone else's picture (I seldom create pictures myself).</p>
<p>Just passing the time.</p>
<p>Sometimes people ignore them.</p>
<p>Other times people "Like" or even "Share" them.</p>
<p>Every once in a while one might inspire a kiss from you-know-who.</p>
<p>Anyway,&nbsp;then something got my attention.</p>
<p>Looking at the posted picture, I was given a new option:</p>
<p><a href="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/0676.facebooksilly.jpg"><img title="Shameless [paid] self-promotion" border="0" alt="Shameless [paid] self-promotion" src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/0676.facebooksilly.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>What the hell?!?</p>
<p>For the record, and&nbsp;to all my friends,&nbsp;I will never pay to announce any post. if you see it and like it then GREAT.</p>
<p>But my value system in its current form requires the approval of just one person. And she isn't for sale, with or without Facebook pimp proxy.</p>
<p>I hope Zuckerberg has less creepy ways for Facebook to make money post-IPO than the "buy more approval from your friends" technique.</p>
<p>Probably good that friends won't be told someone announced posts this way, I can't think of a better metric for unfriending....</p>

Naturally, the checkbox will be on by default.</p>

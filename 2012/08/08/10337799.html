<p>I knew at some point I'd have to deconstruct the support of International Domain Names in Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>In other words, IDN in IE. :-)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is pretty complicated.</p>
<p>So I was looking forward to it like I'd look forward to a root canal, you know?</p>
<p>Thankfully, Eric Lawrence saved me the trouble!</p>
<p>In <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ieinternals/">EricLaw's IEInternals</a>, he wrote <a title="Brain Dump: International Text" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ieinternals/archive/2012/07/13/internet-explorer-and-international-text-encoding-unicode-punycode-ansi-oh-my.aspx">Brain Dump: International Text</a>&nbsp;last month, he explained the IDN settings in this picture:</p>
<p><a href="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/47/13/metablogapi/2251.image_5F00_2CAC61CC.png"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://blogs.msdn.com/resized-image.ashx/__size/550x0/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-47-13-metablogapi/2251.image_5F00_2CAC61CC.png" /></a>,</p>
<p>He also covered all of these "International' settings from the dialog.</p>
<p>In particular:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;" face="Calibri" size="2"><strong>Send IDN server names </strong>is enabled by default and will force IE to encode hostnames in URLs following the rules of <strong><a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3491.txt">RFC3491</a> </strong>and <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3492.txt">RFC3492</a>. The user will be shown the URL in the address bar in Unicode form if and only if the URL is deemed non-spoofable. Please see this IEBlog post on the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2006/07/31/684337.aspx">rules of IDN Non-spoofability</a>.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;" face="Calibri" size="2"><strong>Send IDN server names for Intranet addresses </strong>is disabled by default for compatibility with legacy Windows networks that were using UTF-8 to support non-ASCII hostnames. Other browsers, to the best of my knowledge, do not have special handling for Intranet sites, and I believe that <em>current </em>versions of Active Directory and the Windows DNS server support punycoded hostname registration and lookup.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;Since he did all this work, it saves me the trouble!</p>
<p>Kinda great teamwork, he and I.</p>
<p>I guess there 's no "I" in IE, either! :-)</p>

<p>I guess you choose to use a mixing of single quote &#39; and double quote &quot; here to annoy programmers like me?</p>

<p><strong>Matthew Slyman</strong> on 16 Apr 2013 9:33 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Excellent. Now I must get by back-side in gear and finish designing my system for multi-lingual semantic websites where the URLs themselves are localised (I mean &quot;localized&quot;)! (Masochism perhaps, when one encounters &quot;false friend&quot; words that make a legal URL potentially non-unique and ambiguous between the URIs they&#39;re meant to point at... But when one sorts between the possibilities using the HTTP language preferences of the user, everything becomes clear again... I think...)</p>

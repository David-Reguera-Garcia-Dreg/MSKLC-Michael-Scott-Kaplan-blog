<p>I'm a little annoyed right now.</p>
<p>Allow me to explain. :-)</p>
<p>First, the story:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So I created a Cherokee Phonetic keyboard that friends and colleagues from both <strong>Cherokee Nation</strong> and the <strong>Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians</strong> were pleased with.</p>
<p>And when they had a chance to try it out in Windows 8 they were confused so I showed them what was going on (and based on their feedback I told the team that owns the optimized keyboard in Windows 8 that if their version of the Cherokee Phonetic keyboard were to be exiled from the product (so the actual keyboard popped up instead), that the customers would be much happier.</p>
<p>Then I explained vaguely how it would work based on vague descriptions from others since I lacked the hardware to see it.</p>
<p>And then finally I got the hardware and was able to show how it worked, how cool it was, and how we had to make some changes to make the default experience better!</p>
<p>I reported the&nbsp;problem and offered to put it in as a bug but was assured that they took care of it with other <strong>Release Preview</strong> feedback.</p>
<p><em>At this point, the evil music was starting to play, but I could not hear it -- since I'm not a tester. Testers know not to trust such assurances, and they will routinely put in a bug to <strong>track</strong> the problem.</em></p>
<p>Time passed.</p>
<p>We hit the RTM milestone.</p>
<p>We haven't yet shipped it out to the world, but I could play with the stuff everyone would have soon.</p>
<p>So I did a completely clean install of Windows 8 on both my non-touch self-host machine and my touch one.</p>
<p>So I could test things out.</p>
<p>This is where I got annoyed.</p>
<p>Because first of all, the non-touch-enabled machine never showed the standard layout; it only showed the optimized layout we all determined that we hate. I tested it right on the machine and it didn't work. And as before, the setting was unavailable.</p>
<p>And then second of all, the touch-enabled machine had the same behavior.</p>
<p>Crap.</p>
<p><em>Snakes? Why'd it have to be snakes. If I'd put in a bug, I'd at least have had some warning, some chance to resolve the problem!</em></p>
<p>I started grabbing art for this blog you are reading now to document the blatantly unfixed problem.</p>
<p>Unfixed with extreme prejudice!</p>
<p>But then I stopped for a second.</p>
<p>I mean, did they really&nbsp;break the thing that worked before?</p>
<p>After the <strong>Release Preview</strong>?</p>
<p>Technically, I was testing out the touch-enabled machine via remote desktop&nbsp;from a non-touch-enabled machine.</p>
<p>Perhaps Windows 8 is "smart" enough to not give touch-specific features to touch enabled machines when accessed remotely from non-multitouch machines.</p>
<p>So perhaps they fixed the one small part of the&nbsp;problem they were able to able to, and postponed the rest.</p>
<p>Though if true, they would seem to have thus shipped what rightfully should have been exiled from the product.</p>
<p>So like I said, I'm a little annoyed right now,</p>
<p>I'll try this out tomorrow on the machine and I'll report back on whether I am pissed off or not.</p>
<p>Stay tuned.... :-)</p>

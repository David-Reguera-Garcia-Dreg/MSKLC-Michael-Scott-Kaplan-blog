<h1>Getting your spidey senses FIXED</h1>

<p>The other day,&nbsp;<strong>Peter Parker</strong>&nbsp;(probably not his real name) asked:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><em>How can I determine if a font is fixed width, like Visual Studio does?</em></span></p>
<p>Well,&nbsp;he certainly can't rely on his spidey sense even if he was the real Peter Parker, since Spiderman doesn't scale! :-)</p>
<p>When he referred to "like Visual Studio does", he meant the <strong>Bold</strong> items on the list:</p>
<p><img title="Fixed width fonts are BOLD as love" border="0" alt="Fixed width fonts are BOLD as love" src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/8004.vsfonts01.jpg" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;The principle is simple enough:</p>
<ul>
<li>if the font identifies itself as fixed in its own data as you get by asking for a <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">FIXED_PITCH</span> font in the <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">fdwPitchAndFamily</span> member, or</li>
<li>it follows the "fixed enough" principles discussed <strong><a title="Fonts that are 'fixed-width' even if they do not claim to be" href="../../../2005/09/11/463672.html">here</a></strong> for East Asian fonts.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see many examples of this being correctly done for <strong>Meiryo/</strong><strong>Meiryo UI</strong> (since the Latins are based on <strong>Verdana</strong>) and <strong>Microsoft YaHei</strong>/<strong>Microsoft JhengHei</strong> (since the Latins are based on <strong>Segoe UI</strong>) and so on.</p>
<p>It may even interest our Marvel action hero enough to want to emulate the checks.</p>
<p>However, there are three problems here;</p>
<ul>
<li>while Visual Studio correctly flags <strong>MingLiU</strong>, it misses in the three MingLiU-esque fonts that are just as fixed as well as others, and</li>
<li>almost every East Asian font <strong>is</strong> fixed width for the East Asian characters, at least, and</li>
<li>some other scripts show the same characteristics of "fixed width within the script".</li>
</ul>
<p>I suppose there could be an IsfixedWidth&nbsp;method where you can pass the font name and some text.</p>
<p>It could then return whether all of <em>that</em> text you passed in is the exact same width per character!</p>
<p>For now, you are mildly on your own checking for this.</p>
<p>Even if you spin a web any size and catch thieves just like flies...</p>

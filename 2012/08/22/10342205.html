<p>You may remember prior blogs like <strong><a title="Regarding the overthinking and underimplementing of names" href="../../../2011/05/04/10160919.html">Regarding the overthinking and underimplementing of names</a></strong> from last year that talks a bit about the names we cart around or <strong><a title="Maybe they're just showing off their fancy fonts? ;-)" href="../../06/19/10321621.html">Maybe they're just showing off their fancy fonts? ;-)</a></strong> from a few months ago that openly pointed out one of the big problems of using native languge names in user interfaces.</p>
<p>The simple fact I pointed out:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><em>The odd one out here is the <strong>Native Names</strong>, since each one is most often provided by a different person, one per language - sometimes based on preferences or standards requirements or grammatical rules in each language!</em></span></p>
<p>Anyway, someone was asking again about the different capitalizations in different languages in some other UI was showing.</p>
<p>And someone else, in partial response, pointed out that someone else owned the data, but it may be per language choices. And it continued:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">They may also know, assuming that&rsquo;s true, if there are scenarios in which it&rsquo;s appropriate for a component for force capitalization.</span></em></p>
<p>It is true.</p>
<p>But we don't track when languages would be okay with capitalizing being done by someone else later.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">There is no <strong>LOCALE_INATIVENAMECANBECAPITALIZEDIFYOUREALLYREALLYWANTTODOTHAT</strong> flag</span></p>
<p>I shudder to think of how we would manage all that, myself.</p>
<p>Luckily, the person asking just went ahead and resolved the issue as by design, since it is. ;-)</p>

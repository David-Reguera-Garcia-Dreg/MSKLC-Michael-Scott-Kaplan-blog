<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>All personal stuff, MS stuff, iBot stuff. Skip as needed....</em></span></p>
<p><strong>I can't snowboard anymore.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I really only did it a couple of times,&nbsp;and honestly I usually preferred to just ski if I was going to be on the slopes. But still, I can't do it anymore</p>
<p><strong>I can't ski anymore.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Skiing is something I genuinely miss. I miss it enough that the mitigatory methods I can use to go down the hill feel like e hollow echoes of what once was. A few people now and again have almost convinced me to try it -- heavy emphasis on the <strong>ALMOST</strong>. I was really little more than a very advanced amateur. But I owned it. Well, at least until I didn't.</p>
<p><strong>I can't run anymore.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I used to run fairly often. It was a great way for me decompress if I was angry or frustrated or in any way keyed up. Sometimes I wonder hoe I get rid of all that baggage now. I guess I just blog now instead. But I think running was more fun.</p>
<p><strong>I can't perform Neurodiagnostic tests like EEG/Evoked Potentials or Cerebrovascular tests like Carotid Doppler studies anymore.</strong></p>
<p>Something I did when I was young, I had a specialty in both intra-operative tests (unconscious victims but fine motor skills required) and pediatric tests (I had a "no chloroform" role since it could hurt the test results; this meant I had to be able to charm small children enough to paste electrodes to their heads with collodion,&nbsp;a noxious scent in the best of circumstances!). I still have the charm, but the fine motor skills are beyond me.</p>
<p><strong>I can't draw blood anymore.</strong></p>
<p>Once upon a time I used to do phlebotomy and as certified to do so, in fact. It was a sideline, working for neurologists and neurosurgeons and sticking needles in those kids to check their Dilantin levels. Luckily the charm still holds, but unluckily I can't palpate a vein or properly place the needle even if I could.</p>
<p><strong>I can't ice skate or roller skate anymore.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Not that I did either professionally, but it was fun to do. Ain't gonna happen now, because....</p>
<p><strong>I can't balance myself anymore.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I remember the first day I felt out of control. I was just coming out of Suz's 2nd floor apartment, and halfway down the stairs I was just barely able to keep from falling the rest if the way. This "acute onset" feature has been a part of my life for over a decade.</p>
<p><strong>I can't skateboard anymore.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Never something I was a superhero doing, but I could do an Ollie and all manner of flips, and grinding was not beyond me. To this day, when I pass by the many "skateboard punks" of Seattle who will say the iBot is "so tight that it's sick!" I can either deferentially point out that there was no&nbsp;way I could do a heelflip with it, or with false bravado say that they if I had my custom board I could do a kickflip that would blow their minds.</p>
<p><strong>I can't walk anymore.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This took a lot longer to happen, and was long obviated by using a cane. But it is something where having trouble balancing simply got worse and worse....</p>
<p><strong>I can't dance anymore.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">During my senior year of high school, I had an epiphany about how lame one's dancing is if one is never trained in how to do it. So I took dance lessons, and after quite a few I could foxtrot and waltz and swing dance and mashed potato and salsa and meringue and twist and tango and so on. Until eventually I couldn't. In some ways I miss, a skill that I trained at so hard, the most. A victim of my new clumsiness.</p>
<p><strong>I can't write with pen or pencil&nbsp;anymore.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">My handwriting has never been stellar, but it has been steadily getting worse -- one of&nbsp;my earliest symptoms. Now it's so awful that even for simple events like the&nbsp;blind auction for charity&nbsp;at <strong>Seattle Works SWANK</strong> I could barely scrawl out my my bid number. I joked that next year I'd bring a pricing gun, but who am I kidding? I couldn't aim something like that. Next year I'll just have to talk to someone in Seattle Works about how to make it work...</p>
<p><strong>I can't type fast (or at all) without software assistance anymore</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Another sideline was transcription, and when I think bout the steady and measurable decline of skill from a high point of 180 words a minute with no errors to 20 words a minute with 5-6 errors, it's never clearer in my mind that this is a degenerative illness.</p>
<hr />
<p>I could could go&nbsp;on, but you get the point.</p>
<p>This random assortment of things that for either personal or professional reasons I can't do anymore are basically just the price of my disease.</p>
<p>Some of these problems, I overcome with the iBot, while other parts I overcome with computer software.</p>
<p>But MS has had its price....</p>

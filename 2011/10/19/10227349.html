<p>Okay, first the joke. My dad sent it to me....</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">An Englishman, a Scotsman, an Irishman, a Welshman, a Latvian, a Turk, a German, an Indian, several Americans (including a southerner, a New Englander, and a Californian) an Argentinean, a Dane, an Australian, a Slovakian, an&nbsp;Egyptian, a Japanese, a Moroccan, a Frenchman, a New Zealander, a Spaniard, a Russian, a Guatemalan, a Colombian, a Pakistani, a Malaysian, a Croatian, a Uzbek, a Cypriot, a Pole, a Lithuanian, a Chinese, a Sri Lankan, a Lebanese, a Cayman Islander, a Ugandan, a Vietnamese, a Korean, a Uruguayan, a Czech, an Icelander, a Mexican, a Finn, a Honduran, a Panamanian, an Andorran, an Israeli, a Venezuelan, a Fijian, a Peruvian, an Estonian, a Brazilian, a Portuguese, a Liechtensteiner, a Mongolian, a Hungarian, a Canadian, a Moldovan, a Haitian, a Norfolk Islander, a Macedonian, a Bolivian, a Cook Islander, a Tajikistani, a Samoan, an Armenian, a Aruban, an Albanian, a Greenlander, a Micronesian, a Virgin Islander, a Georgian, a Bahaman, a Belarusian, a Cuban, a Tongan, a Cambodian, a Qatari, an Azerbaijani, a Romanian, a Chilean, a Kyrgyzstani, a Jamaican, a Filipino, a Ukrainian, a Dutchman, a Ecuadorian, a Costa Rican, a Swede, a Bulgarian, a Serb, a Swiss, a Greek, a Belgian, a Singaporean, an Italian, a Norwegian and 47 Africans walk into a fine estaurant....</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">The ma&icirc;tre d' scrutinizes the group one by one and bars their entrance saying, <strong>Sorry, you can't come in here without a Thai.</strong>"</span></p>
<p>:-)</p>
<p>So, now that you have Thai on your mind....</p>
<p>I wrote it just the other day near the end of June.</p>
<p><strong><a title="An irresistible force walks into an immovable object (aka the Thai that binds us)" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2011/06/24/10178528.html">An irresistible force walks into an immovable object (aka the Thai that binds us)</a></strong>, I mean.</p>
<p>You know, the thing about the PUA character hidden on the Thai Pattachote keybord:</p>
<p><img src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/3666.Pattachote01.jpg" /></p>
<p>After due and careful consideration, the campaign to remove the PUA looks like it will win over the rule about changing a keyboard.</p>
<p>But the important question then is what to put there insead....</p>
<p>Like there is the link to the&nbsp;Oracle site (<a href="http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/E19253-01/817-2521/asian.supported.locales-246/index.html">http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/E19253-01/817-2521/asian.supported.locales-246/index.html</a>) that appears to be Phinthu -- U+0e3a.</p>
<p>Or Peter found another possibility:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;"><a href="http://www.chrismary.com/languagekeyboard/thai_pattachote.htm">This site</a>, which sells keycap stickers, shows a Pattachote layout with basic keys plus three extras not found on all hardware. One has nikahit with nothing on its shifted state. There isn&rsquo;t any phintu or lakkangyao, though both are very rarely used characters....I&rsquo;d probably replace the PUA code point with lakkangyao: I think there&rsquo;s more likelihood of someone typing that than phintu. E.g., you need to type it if you&rsquo;re enumerating the <i>complete</i> alphabet, but not phintu.</span></p>
<p>Fair enough, perhaps lakkangyao sounds unreasonable.</p>
<p>I'll run it up the flapole and see if anyone salutes it....</p>

For those guessing &quot;a lazy way of having one from each country without listing them&quot;, there are 54 countries in Africa (that was my first guess so I checked).</p>

The 3.x version ignored Caps-Lock state for AltGr-ed characters, making typing in capitals awkward. It was clearly a bug, and the change was very good.</p>

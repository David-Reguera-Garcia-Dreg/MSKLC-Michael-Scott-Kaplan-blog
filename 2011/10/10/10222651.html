<p><em>Insert gratuitous shot of the Olson twins, who this blog is not about, here:</em></p>

<p>Several people in the industry tend to bemoan a common pattern whereby we at Microsoft&nbsp;always have to do our own thing.</p>
<p>We do it in collation. We do it in locales. We do it in time zones.</p>
<p>For the most part, the reason we do or own thing is that there is nothing there we can use.So we build our own.</p>
<p>At that point, we usually don't tend to turn around and share it, which is why so often other things are created.</p>
<p>And no one wants to throw out what we did before since it built up on what people are using and depending on.</p>
<p>We just can't see the upside to just throwing it all away to pick up the UCA. Or CLDR. Or the Olson data.</p>
<p>And then we are left with people throughout the word sighing at having to deal with the "Microsoft" case and the "everyone else" case....</p>
<p>Well, except not this week.</p>
<p>There was a panic on the Internet late last week.</p>
<p>It came from the following mail:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">&nbsp;From: "Olson, Arthur David (NIH/NCI) [E]" &lt;<a href="http://wm.seanet.com/src/compose.php?send_to=olsona%40dc37a.nci.nih.gov">olsona@dc37a.nci.nih.gov</a>&gt;<br />&nbsp;Subject: Civil suit; ftp shutdown; mailing list shutdown<br />&nbsp;Date: October 6, 2011 8:16:02 AM PDT<br />&nbsp;To: "'<a href="http://wm.seanet.com/src/compose.php?send_to=tz%40elsie.nci.nih.gov">tz@elsie.nci.nih.gov</a>'" &lt;<a href="http://wm.seanet.com/src/compose.php?send_to=tz%40lecserver.nci.nih.gov">tz@lecserver.nci.nih.gov</a>&gt;<br />&nbsp;Reply-To: <a href="http://wm.seanet.com/src/compose.php?send_to=tz%40elsie.nci.nih.gov">tz@elsie.nci.nih.gov</a><br />&nbsp;<br />A civil suit was filed on September 30 in federal court in Boston; I'm a<br />defendant; the case involves the time zone database.<br />&nbsp;<br />The ftp server at elsie.nci.nih.gov has been shut down.<br />&nbsp;<br />The mailing list will be shut down after this message.<br />&nbsp;<br />Electronic mail can be sent to me at <a href="http://wm.seanet.com/src/compose.php?send_to=arthurdavidolson%40gmail.com">arthurdavidolson@gmail.com</a>.<br />&nbsp;<br />I hope there will be better news shortly.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --ado</p>
<p>This news, that the Olson database was being taken offline due to a lawsuit, caused something of a panic in the i18n space, everywhere except for one place.</p>
<p>That on place?</p>
<p>Microsoft.</p>
<p>Now I don't know how everyone in Microsoft who had a stake in time zones reacted, but I know exactly what I felt.</p>
<p>Relief.</p>
<p>Relief that this lawsuit didn't relate to us.</p>
<p>Perhaps a mild dash of vindication was kind of flowing through there as well -- relief that our "less open" thing/process had at least one thing going for it...</p>
<p>Well, at least insofar as "not a target in a lawsuit" can be considered a thing, that is.</p>
<p>So now the story unfolds and blog posts like <a href="http://blog.joda.org/2011/10/today-time-zone-database-was-closed.html">this one</a>&nbsp;talk about the suit.</p>
<p>And of course there is the expected discussion on <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/story/11/10/06/1743226/civil-suit-filed-involving-the-time-zone-database">Slashdot</a>.</p>
<p>I expect it will all resolve itself, eventually.</p>
<p>But until then, the Unicode Standard folks in the CLDR may be kicking themselves for embracing Olson data,&nbsp;rather than&nbsp;following standards like SQL (where folks like Jim Melton have been long against referencing Olson data, and they have a huge "I told you so" feeling). Kind of like the implied one I have for people inside MS who thought a move to Olson was inevitable.</p>
<p>All I know is that one doesn't have to hang out with Mary-Kate and Ashley to feel exposed by an Olson&nbsp;connection, these days....</p>
<hr/><p><strong>John Cowan</strong> on 10 Oct 2011 11:45 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>I think you&#39;re missing the real injustice of this lawsuit. &nbsp;There probably isn&#39;t a single day in which Microsoft isn&#39;t being sued for something or other, but if someone came after you for patent violations in MSKLC, I&#39;m fairly confident that Microsoft would defend the lawsuit for you. &nbsp;Such is not the case for Olson&#39;s and Eggert&#39;s employers: the Federal Government has sovereign immunity, and if the University of California is going to defend Eggert, they certainly haven&#39;t said so. &nbsp;So these two are licked before they start: they need to hire expensive copyright lawyers they are not likely to be able to afford, even though the case is obviously meritless.</p>

<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 10 Oct 2011 12:19 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>I haven&#39;t seen the case so I can&#39;t tell if it is meritless or not (copyright troll doesn&#39;t *always* mean meritless) -- I know nothing about their review process at all. Since so many organizations make sure to guard against this sort of thing -- including open source -- it is weird that this one was overlooked....</p>

<p><strong>cheong00</strong> on 10 Oct 2011 6:38 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>I don&#39;t know, but if you&#39;re going to use source from a book for public work, it helps if you gather written permission to use in the beginning. Lots of publishing companies are generous on &quot;public good&quot; things and this would have high possibiliy to be granted if asked properly.</p>
<p>If such permission exists, he can probably present it to the judge and ask him drop the case to avoid the expensive lawyer fees. (Btw, I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s such procedure to block lawsuit with clearly written proof in US)</p>

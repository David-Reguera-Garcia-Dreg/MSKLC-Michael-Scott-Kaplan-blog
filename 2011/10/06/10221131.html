<h1>The unused case case (i.e. the case of the unused case), part 2</h1>

<p>Part 1 of this two part series can be found at <strong><a title="The unused case case (i.e. the case of the unused case)" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2011/10/05/10220274.html">The unused case case (i.e. the case of the unused case)</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Now in that part I pointed out three general scenarios covered by Digit Substitution across various versions of Windows:</p>
<ol>
<li>LOCALE_SNATIVEDIGITS are there, and LOCALE_IDIGITSUBSTITUTION has them turned on!</li>
<li>LOCALE_SNATIVEDIGITS are not&nbsp;there, but LOCALE_IDIGITSUBSTITUTION has them turned off anyway, so who cares?</li>
<li>LOCALE_SNATIVEDIGITS are not there, but LOCALE_IDIGITSUBSTITUTION has them turned on -- a classic no-op bug (described previously in <a title="A difference that makes no difference makes a blog" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2011/05/18/10165599.html"><strong>A difference that makes no difference makes a blog</strong></a>)</li>
</ol>
<p>I then pointed out that there was an obvious missing scenario.</p>
<p>In plain terms:</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: large;">LOCALE_SNATIVEDIGITS <span style="color: #ff0000;">are</span> there, but LOCALE_IDIGITSUBSTITUTION has them turned <span style="color: #ff0000;">off</span>.</span></strong></p>
<p>This is unlike scenario #3, which is basically a bug.</p>
<p>And although this didn't tend to generally occur to me before, this additional case is actually used at times -&nbsp;has a lot of appeal for some scenarios.</p>
<p>The ones&nbsp;where we determine the native digits are not most commonly used but are not enirely unheard of.</p>
<p>Like in Tamil and Bengali, which have LOCALE_SNATIVEDIGITS values of ০১২৩৪৫৬৭৮৯ and ௦௧௨௩௪௫௬௭௮௯, respectively -- despite the fact that they both set LOCALE_IDIGITSUBSTITUTION to "Never" substitute.</p>
<p>You can contrast this with Hindi, which use #2 above, and thus 0123456789 in LOCALE_SNATIVEDIGITS, rather than ०१२३४५६७८९.</p>
<p>The net effect? There is no programmatic way to query the "alternate preferred digits" in the&nbsp;Hindi case. Like you can with Bangla and Tamil.</p>
<p>Part of me&nbsp;feels that this may seem a little unnatural -- like an airplane intentionally making a bad landing.</p>
<p>But this scheme gives a flexibility of potential usage&nbsp;that none of the others can....which ultmimately makes ot more useful in such cases!</p>
<hr/><p><strong>John Cowan</strong> on 6 Oct 2011 10:57 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>In Tamil, at least, the native digits are mostly obsolete: they are not used to represent numbers in ordinary circumstances. &nbsp;In fact, they are used Chinese-style without a zero: &nbsp;1066 is &quot;1 thousand 6 ten 6&quot;.</p>

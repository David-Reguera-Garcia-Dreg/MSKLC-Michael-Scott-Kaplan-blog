<h1>Unicode 6.0 -- one web page at a time</h1>

<p>Reactions to that video of the Unicode characters I talked about in <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2011/04/13/10153025.html" title="49571 &amp;asymp; 2&amp;pi; Sympathetic Characters, which I believe proves truth &amp;asymp; beauty"><strong>49571 &asymp; 2&pi; Sympathetic Characters, which I believe proves truth &asymp; beauty</strong></a>&nbsp;were plentiful.</p>
<p>But regular reader Andrew West was not impressed. His reaction in a comment to that blog on the same day:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">It would be cool if it did show every single graphic Unicode character, or even all characters in the BMP, but it is 5,000 characters short of what's currently in the BMP, and seems not to include anything much encoded during the last ten years.</span></em></p>
<p>Then, a few days later, he decided to try and do a better job, in his own blog titled <a href="http://babelstone.blogspot.com/2011/04/unicode-60-one-character-at-time.html">Unicode 6.0 &mdash; One character at a time</a>. From his intro:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">A recent </span><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_sl99D2a18"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">youtube video</span></a><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;"> by </span><a href="http://joerg.piringer.net/index.php?href=unicode/unicode.xml"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">j&ouml;rg piringer</span></a><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;"> that scrolls through "all" 49,571 Unicode characters in 33 minutes and 16 seconds (25 characters a second) has been doing the rounds, but I'm afraid that I was not impressed. The 49,571 characters in the video only cover the <span title="Basic Multilingual Plane">BMP</span>, and even then it is 5,000 characters short, missing out most of the characters that have been added to Unicode over the past ten years, and missing out entirely some scripts that have been in Unicode since <span title="1991">Year Zero</span>.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.0.0/" title="Unicode 6.0.0"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">Unicode version 6.0</span></a><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;"> (released October 2010) actually defines 109,384 characters (109,244 graphic and 140 format characters). How many of them you are able to see depends upon your operating system, your browser and whether you have additional fonts installed covering obscure and recently encoded scripts and characters (and whether your browser will actually apply those fonts or not). On my Windows 7 SP1 machine, with no additional fonts installed, I can see 95,372 of these 109,384 characters (87.1% coverage of total number of characters, but only fully covering 66 out of 203 blocks, and 85 blocks with no coverage at all).</span></p>
<p>Now that says it all for me, on several levels.</p>
<p>And then his "video" is pretty amazing too. Check out his blog, and also the JavaScript page. You'll see what I mean.</p>
<p>Lessons learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mac ain't all that, it is too easy to be missing stuff (you can do better on Windows);</li>
<li>Windows has some distance to go as well here -- we can do better, too, and speaking for myself I'd rather aim higher than "better than Apple" since I like our priorities a little better in regard to language (when it comes to operating systems, at least!);</li>
<li>Andrew's custom font version that has 99% coverage of Unicode reminds me of why I enjoy his work as much as I do -- it is quite simply amazing....</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks, Andrew! :-)</p>
<hr/><p><strong>Andrew West</strong> on 20 Apr 2011 12:51 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Thanks for the kind words. &nbsp;I agree that the Mac is way overrated wrt international support. &nbsp;Windows 7&#39;s out of the box coverage of Unicode is very impressive, and even more so if you take into account the fact that its target version of Unicode was 5.1, for which it has a whopping 94.75% coverage. &nbsp;And it is not just the major, commercially important scripts that are supported, but minor modern-use scripts such as Tibetan, Mongolian, Nuosu (Yi), Nko, Osmanya, Tifinagh and Vai, as well as historical scripts such as Phags-pa, Runic and Ogham. &nbsp;Of course, there is always room for improvement (and I haven&#39;t been shy in pointing out my frustrations with Windows) -- for example, how about updating Microsoft Himalaya to cover the 18 additional Tibetan characters that have been encoded since the font was first designed?</p>

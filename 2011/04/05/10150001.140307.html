<p>Men Without Hats? Whatever happened to them? I hear they're still touring.</p>
 <p>h, never mind them, the one hit wonders.</p>
 <p>Because today I am on the <strong>Take the One Day Without Shoes Challenge</strong>!</p>
 <p style="PADDING-LEFT: 90px">When Blake Mycoskie founded the footwear company TOMS, he built a company that would match every pair of shoes purchased with a pair of new shoes given to a child in need&mdash;one for one. <br /><br />Speaking to employees on campus recently, Mycoskie urged them to participate in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.onedaywithoutshoes.com/splash">One Day Without Shoes</a>&nbsp;on April 5. Millions of children grow up without shoes and are at risk for infection, disease, and even limited opportunities as a result. The idea of One Day Without Shoes is to get as many people as possible around the world to go barefoot for one day to raise awareness&nbsp;of this issue.&nbsp;Every time someone buys a pair of shoes from Mycoskie's company, he donates a pair to a shoeless child somewhere in the world. </p>
 <div style="PADDING-LEFT: 90px"><br />Mycoskie formed TOMS after visiting Argentina as a competitor in the second season of television's "The Amazing Race." While there, he saw dozens of children without shoes. His company, which now sells shoes in upscale retailers worldwide, has donated more than 1 million pairs of shoes. </div>

 <p>Thus today I am wearing no shoes.</p>
 <p>It reminded me a little of <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2010/07/24/10041833.html" title="My 2 out of 119 (11 + 108) trips around the Chilkur Balaji Temple's inner shrine"><strong>My 2 out of 119 (11 + 108) trips around the Chilkur Balaji Temple's inner shrine</strong></a>. And <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2010/12/24/10108811.html" title="Yes, I'll take my shoes off. *I* don't have to walk on that dirty floor!"><strong>Yes, I'll take my shoes off. *I* don't have to walk on that dirty floor!</strong></a>. Except my shoes would be of all day.</p>
 <p>Now unlike Brandon (who seldom wears shoes), I usually wear shoes. At least in public. </p>
 <p>But I have two unusual issues to think about in the context of a shoeless day:</p>
 <ol>
 <li>I am in an iBot and my feet are never on the floor -- as it did in <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2010/12/24/10108811.html" title="Yes, I'll take my shoes off. *I* don't have to walk on that dirty floor!"><strong>Yes, I'll take my shoes off. *I* don't have to walk on that dirty floor!</strong></a>, it makes the shoeless thing easier. Perhaps a little less meaningful.</li>
 <li>I injured my left foot on Sunday.</li>
 </ol>
 <p>Maybe I should explain that second point a bit further.</p>
 <p>You see, on Sunday I had kind of an incident that involved me twisting and hitting the ground stranegly, after narrowly avoiding hitting my head.</p>
 <p><em>I have a long history of unusual falls; I once had a friend compare my falls to the scene in The Matrix when Neo is dodging bullets. Just part of my disequlibrium!</em></p>
 <p>The injury was most severe to <strong>the little piggie who had none</strong>. Though <strong>the piggie who had roast beef</strong> was also mildly&nbsp;affected, with only&nbsp;minor involvement&nbsp;just under&nbsp;<strong>the little piggie who stayed home</strong>.</p>
 <p>Anyway, I was telling a really good friend about the incident via text last night, and it was an interesting conversation:</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Her:</strong> You talked to me yesterday! You almost fell and didn't say a word?<br /><strong>Me: </strong>No, I didn't almost fall.<br /><strong>Her:</strong> ???<br /><strong>Me: </strong>I didn't almost fall.<br /><strong>Me:</strong>&nbsp;I fell!<br /><strong>Her:</strong> You fell and you didn't say a word?<br /><strong>Me:</strong> I didn't feel anything.<br /><strong>Her:</strong> And who do u call asap...when u fall...twist...crash...<br /><strong>Her:</strong> Me!<br /><strong>Me:</strong> I didn't even see the bruise until the next morning in the shower.<br /><strong>Her:</strong> How bad is it?<br /><strong>Me: </strong>Like I know feet. I'll send you a picture of it.<br />{I then forwarded a picture of my foot. This picture:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-filesystemfile.ashx/__key/CommunityServer-Blogs-Components-WeblogFiles/00-00-00-33-81/8463.foot.jpg" title="Click the foot to see the bigger image of it"><img height="299" width="165" src="http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-filesystemfile.ashx/__key/CommunityServer-Blogs-Components-WeblogFiles/00-00-00-33-81/8463.foot.jpg" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><strong>Her:</strong> OMG<br /><strong>Her:</strong> OMG<br /><strong>Her:</strong> OMG<br /><strong>Me:</strong> My feet are pretty ugly, huh?<br /><strong>Her:</strong> Not ugly...just broken.<br /><strong>Her:</strong> Ya you might want to get that checked</p>
 <p>There you have it.</p>
 <p>Me and my "broken" foot.</p>
 <p>I'm going to be in the office for most of the day today.&nbsp;And while I am, I'll be wearing no shoes.</p>
 <p>I am taking the shoeless challenge!</p>
 <p>Eventually, maybe I'll have someone take a look at the foot, just in case....</p>
 <p>Maybe I'll post a picture of it during the day if I can get someone to take it. And maybe I'll make that foot picture my avatar, or my profile pic, for a bit....</p>

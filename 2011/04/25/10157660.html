<p>This last weekend extremely unusual.</p>
<p>Perhaps not the single most unusual weekend of my life, but in the top five, certainly.</p>
<p>I'll explain in reverse order why this is the case.</p>
<p>It is a tale of joy and pain, of the drunkests of&nbsp;debauchery and the soberest&nbsp;of reflections&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>First, there was Sunday, and <strong>Sakura-Con</strong>. The huge anime conference at the Seattle Convention Center. Here I am with one of the Domo dudes who did so well in the Ballmer "Developers" mashup:</p>
<p><img height="800" width="600" src="http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer-Blogs-Components-WeblogFiles/00-00-00-33-81/2656.domo.jpg" style="-ms-interpolation-mode: nearest-neighbor;" />&nbsp;&nbsp; <iframe width="240" frameborder="0" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/CZr2qXVlEcs" height="195" title="YouTube video player"></iframe></p>
<p>It was pretty amazing, and all I can say is that it is even more amazing in an iBot. To quote Ferris Bueller, "if you have the means, I highly recommend it." Everyone&nbsp;was amazed, and by my somewhat&nbsp;rough calculations (I didn't&nbsp;have a slide rule on me) I am ~8000% more likely to have a woman or lady or girl&nbsp;look at me and say something akin to "<strong>that's amazing!</strong>" when I have the iBot than back when I did not. I still don't know exactly how to convert this <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/11/24/9135043.html" title="From I SCOOT to IBOT, #5 of ?? (sometimes it is phase 3 that is ????)"><strong>and get to stage 3</strong></a>&nbsp;but I'm working on it....</p>
<p>I also had a father there offer me <strong>$100,000 </strong>for my iBot (I've gotten similar offers before). This guy knew it was no longer being made and was interested for his brother's sake. I politely declined but gave him&nbsp;a promise to follow up with him&nbsp;on several "save the iBot" efforts and some other resources.&nbsp;Two 14-year-olds who witnessed me turning down <strong>$100,000</strong> thing were in shock....</p>
<p>Maybe I'll talk more about the new schticks I added to my 'explaining the iBot' repertoire, another day.</p>
<p>For now I'll move off of Sunday and go back in time to Saturday.</p>
<hr />
<p>Saturday was <span style="font-size: large;"><strong>BUNNARCHY</strong></span>!</p>
<p>Somewhere between 500 and 1000 people took part in a 12-hour themed bar crawl, with everyone dressed as bunnies.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, also several rabbit accessories (carrots!) and</p>
<p><img src="http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer-Blogs-Components-WeblogFiles/00-00-00-33-81/0116.bunnarchy.jpg" /></p>
<p>one of several Jessica Rabbits (this one played by new friend&nbsp;Erin Bohlmann -- as she'll tell you: don't hate her, she's just drawn that way!) and one undercover Santa Claus (who plans to be an undercover bunny at SantaCon later this year)....</p>
<p>Perhaps you have never found yourself in a Zorro mask and Santa hat riding an iBot with 500+ drunken bunnies somewhere on 1st Avenue in Seattle for half a day.</p>
<p>Let me tell you, if you have not, then you really need to consider trying it!</p>
<p>My Santa logic was based on a South Park -- one where <strong>Jesus </strong>was&nbsp;mad that he had like two Christmas songs that were about him, and all the rest were about Santa. I consider this bit of costume trickery (assisted by&nbsp;goodest friend Kristi Grinnell) to be Santa's way of pointing out that he gets <strong>no coverage </strong>during Jesus's big "Walk like a Zombie with a soul" day....</p>
<p>That entire day rocked from beginning to end, all 12+ hours for those who made it the whole way from breakfast at 10:30am to the end of the walk in Belltown.</p>
<p>Which brings us, inevitably,&nbsp;to Friday.</p>
<hr />
<p>Friday.</p>

<p>So like I said, a quite unusual weekend....</p>

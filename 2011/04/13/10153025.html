<h1>49571 ≈ 2π Sympathetic Characters, which I believe proves truth ≈ beauty</h1>

<p>Curses to Wes Miller for making my life interesting in distracting ways.</p>
<p>Well, just kidding. No curses. But he has a habit of sending me interesting things to look at over Facebook IM.</p>
<p>Like this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_sl99D2a18">Unicode video</a>&nbsp;on YouTube:</p>
<p><iframe width="640" frameborder="0" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Z_sl99D2a18?rel=0" height="390" title="YouTube video player"></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;What it does is run through ever visible character in Unicode from U+0000 to U+ffff, also known as the BMP, the basic multilingual plane.</p>
<p>It can be interesting to watch the video at various speeds, perhaps following along with the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.unicode.org/roadmaps/bmp/">Unicode Roadmap of the BMP</a>, also known as Plane 0.</p>
<p>The full video in HD is a 33 minutes and 16 seconds adventure of 49,571 characters, one frame per character.</p>
<p>Maybe you can find your favorite character this way. :-)</p>
<p>I chose to watch it straight through while listening to <strong>Sympathetic Character</strong>&nbsp;from Alanis Morissette's <strong>Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie</strong>. The song was able to play a hair over 2&pi; times, and after a brief estimate of starting from the &pi; character (U+03c0, Greek Small Letter Pi) then it's closer to exactly 2&pi; times, which seems like it has to mean something interesting.</p>
<p>Now I'm not ordinarily a huge numerological freak. But seeing 49,571 characters in Unicode put me in an&nbsp;interesting place.</p>
<p>In any case, enjoy the video. It is very cool....&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 13 Apr 2011 4:54 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Ugh, adding the additional characters would crush my mathematical and numerological theories involving Alanis Morissette. </p>
<p>Bummer, I thought it might have indicated another bite at the apple! (<a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/10/28/5730199.html">ref</a>)</p></div>

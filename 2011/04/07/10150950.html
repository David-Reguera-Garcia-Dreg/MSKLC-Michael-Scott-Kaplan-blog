<p>Some may recall my "New Year's" coverage of the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/goglobal/">GoGlobal Development Center</a>, described in <strong>"You think this is better. Really?"</strong>, <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2010/12/31/10109814.html" title="Part 1"><strong>Part 1</strong></a> and <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2011/01/01/10110567.html" title="Part 2"><strong>Part 2</strong></a>.</p>
<p>I pointed out what I saw aas many flaws in GoGlobal that I saw.</p>
<p>And then I waxed on philosophically about the whole thing.</p>
<p>If you are a regular reader, you may have been here. You know what I'm like....</p>
<p>For me, the core issues really related to the bread and butter features: getting to/using the keyboard layouts, getting to/using the code pages.And so on. </p>
<p>And getting to MSKLC, which is still&nbsp; pretty popular thing. :-)</p>
<p>For all the fancy bluster about the old GlobalDev or the new GoGlobal, that is where the most traffic can be expected, really.</p>
<p>Well, let me tell you, by that metric, <strong>they have done a pretty huge turnaround!</strong></p>
<p>If you look at the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/goglobal/">GoGlobal Development Center</a>&nbsp;now, you will see, over on the right side:</p>
<p><img src="http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer-Blogs-Components-WeblogFiles/00-00-00-33-81/2818.goglobal1.jpg" /></p>
<p>That's right, pointers to the keyboard layouts and code pages, and a pointer to get MSKLC.</p>
<p>Also, they fixed a bug in the blog feed that was causing it to not only not pick up my blogs to only pick up old ones. This was nothing to do with me like i mused, just as bug.</p>
<p>Since no one else is writing as muc, I guess I can often coumt on the <strong>GoGlobal Blogs</strong> section to be a link to my latest blogs:</p>
<p><img src="http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer-Blogs-Components-WeblogFiles/00-00-00-33-81/1385.goglobal2.jpg" /></p>
<p>Maybe they can cap mine at a few and grab some other people's too. :-)</p>
<p>Now even more impressively, they fixed the problems with the Lead Byte links on the East Asian code pages <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/goglobal/cc305152">932</a>, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/goglobal/cc305153">936</a>, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/goglobal/cc305154">949</a>, and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/goglobal/cc305155">950</a>. </p>
<p>All of the links work now, and all of the content has been migrated to the new site!</p>
<p>Amazing how getting links to the basic stuff can make everything seem better, isn't it?</p>
<p>I'll tell you, I am a lot mor bullish about the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/goglobal/">GoGlobal Development Center</a>. I am going to keep my eye on thie site and see what else it comes up with!</p>

<p><strong>A LITTLE BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON KYRGYZ</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>NUMBER OF SPEAKERS</strong>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">3 million speakers</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>NAME IN THE LANGUAGE ITSELF</strong>: </p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-size: xx-large;">кыргыз</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Kyrgyz is (together with Russian) the official language of the Central Asian Republic of Kyrgyzstan. In Kyrgyzstan, the percentage of people claiming Kyrgyz as their first language dropped from 67% to 44% in the years between 1926 and 1970 due to the large influx of non-Kyrgyz speakers. After Kyrgyzstan became an independent nation in 1991, an aggressive language policy tried to revert the trend and re-"Kyrgyzify" the country. </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Outside of Kyrgyzstan, Kyrgyz is spoken in neighboring countries such as China (150,000 speakers, mainly in Sinkiang-Uighur Autonomous Region), Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Kyrgyz is an agglutinative language: Suffixes are added to fixed stems to generate meaning. The word order in sentences is Subject-Object-Verb, and therefore Kyrgyz has postpositions rather than prepositions and relative clauses precede the verb.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>FUN FACTS</strong>: </p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">&bull;&nbsp;There has been some confusion around the terms Kyrgyz and Kazakh. Kazakh has been referred to as Kirghiz, Kirghiz-Kaisak, or Kazakh-Kirghiz while Kara-Kirghiz or Kara-Kyrgyz (black Kyrgyz) was the term used for what we call Kyrgyz. Also, in Turkish, Kyrgyz is known as Kırgız T&uuml;rk&ccedil;esi (Kyrgyz Turkish).<br />&bull;&nbsp;By only allowing Russian as a base langauge, they avoid several of the issues discussed in <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2010/06/25/10025030.html" title="Майкрософт vs. Microsoft, aka On choosing the most reasonable inconsistency"><strong>Майкрософт vs. Microsoft, aka On choosing the most reasonable inconsistency</strong></a>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrgyz_language">Click here</a> for more information about the Kyrgyz language <br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>CLASSIFICATION</strong>: </p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Kyrgyz is a member of the Kipchak group of languages which belongs to the Turkic languages (which also include Azerbaijani, Tartar or Uzbek). Its closest relative is Kazakh. </p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>SCRIPT</strong>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">In Kyrgyztan, Kyrgyz has been written in a modified Cyrillic script (with 3 special characters) since 1940 (while in China a modified Arabic script is used). Until 1923 an Arabic script was used in Kyrgyztan and after, from 1928 to 1940, Kyrgyz used the Unified Turkic Latin Alphabet. There were plans to return to the Latin alphabet in the early 1990s, but these were never implemented.</p>

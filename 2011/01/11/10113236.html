<h1>ARM port of Windows? No comment. Followed by a comment....</h1>

<p>So, it was just the other day that regular reader Yunhong Bao asked me, in a&nbsp;comment to my <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2011/01/06/10094190.html" title="Still with the Itanium?"><strong>Still with the Itanium?</strong></a> blog:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><em>What do you think about the recently announced ARM port of Windows?</em></p>
<p>My official response is to decline to comment.</p>
<p>The people talking about it know a lot more than I do, so my thoughts are not very relevant.</p>
<p>Now off the record, there is one thing about the annoncement that excites me.</p>
<p>I mean, as I mentioned in <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2011/01/07/10112915.html" title="Had I known that my last release would be *the* last release..., aka hindsight is 2020"><strong>Had I known that my last release would be *the* last release..., aka hindsight is 2020</strong></a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't own MSKLC anymore, and</li>
<li>the team that does own it does not seem anxious to ship an update.</li>
</ul>
<p>But the 1.4 update was principally done for the sake of adding x64/IA64 support.</p>
<p>So perhaps the ARM port will lead to an eventual MSKLC update to support keyboards on the platform!</p>
<p>Maybe they'll&nbsp;fix some of the other bugs while they are in there!</p>

<p>I suppose there wouldn&#39;t be anything stopping someone attaching a USB keyboard to a USB port, though, assuming the devices support USB host mode (and if they didn&#39;t, what would be the point of full Windows rather than just using Windows Phone or Windows CE, which have run on ARM processors for at least ten years?)</p>

</ul>
<p>So I've talked a lot about new keyboards and new locales and such, and everything I have talked about so far has four things in common:</p>
<ol>
<li>They are all features of Windows 8 (and.Net 4.5, where applicable), and</li>
<li>They are all things that I think are really cool, and</li>
<li>They have all been a long time coming, and</li>
<li>I have been intimately involved with every of them.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some casual (and not-so-casual)&nbsp;readers might assume that I am perhaps only going talk about stuff that meets all four criteria.</p>
<p>But today I'm going talk something that only&nbsp;the first three apply&nbsp;to; my involvement has been limited at best.</p>
<p>In other words, you can think of it as proof that I believe there are cool features in Windows 8 that I had very little to do with! :-)</p>
<p>I'll start with a blog of mine from this last March, <strong><a title="Nastaliq is not just another script..." href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2011/03/25/10145717.html">Nastaliq is not just another script...</a></strong>.</p>
<p>And the new Windows 8 font: <span style="font-size: xx-large;"><strong>Urdu Typesetting</strong></span>., a new member of the Arabic script font family:</p>
<p><a href="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/5277.urdutypesetting.jpg"><img style="max-width: 550px;" border="0" alt="" src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/5277.urdutypesetting.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>It&nbsp;will be (and given how many people have or&nbsp;are&nbsp;installing the //Build Developer Preview of Windows 8, is)&nbsp;the first widely available Unicode font to support Nastaliq.</p>
<p>Here you can see it contrasted with <strong>Arabic Typesetting</strong>, a Naskh based font, for the same text:</p>
<p><a href="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/4721.nastaliq01.jpg"><img style="max-width: 550px;" border="0" alt="" src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/4721.nastaliq01.jpg" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/5707.nastaliq02.jpg"><img style="max-width: 550px;" border="0" alt="" src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/5707.nastaliq02.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>That's in WordPad.</p>
<p>And here is in Notepad:</p>
<p><a href="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/3644.nastaliq03.jpg"><img style="max-width: 550px;" border="0" alt="" src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/3644.nastaliq03.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Now as I pointed out yesterday:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;" align="left"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;" size="3">That Nastaleeq and not Naskh should be the writing style used for computers is also based on this misconceived &ldquo;Nastaleeq or Naskh&rdquo; notion &ndash; which in turn is an unfortunate legacy of Urdu word processing packages which supported one style or the other. So far as Unicode is concerned, for example word Pakistan would always comprise of characters Pay, Alef, Kaf, Seen, Tay, Alef and Noon.</span></em></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: small;" size="3">The underlying text here is equivalent underneath, but the Nastaliq is quite&nbsp;simply overwhelming preferred by many people for use in Urdu documents -- like Urdu poetry, for example.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: small;" size="3">Anyway, if you have the Windows 8 Developer Preview, you can try out <strong>Urdu Typesetting</strong> to see how it works for you.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: small;" size="3">Keep in mind that it is mostly meant to be a Document font, not a UI font -- which should suit the needs of most of the people who have been asking for it, though I imagine people trying it out might try&nbsp;it many different places and at many different sizes. This is a font that really does need a little space -- you have been warned!</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: small;" size="3">One&nbsp;caveat: a </span><span style="font-size: small;" size="3">lot of work happened over the last few months to improve the font: lots of kerning was added, for example,and some compatibility work to fix minor bugs people found in Word vs. WordPad vs. Notepad. I was almost tempted to say nothing until beta, but someone would have stumbled on the font. Perhaps someone already has. S<span style="font-size: small;" size="3">o after talking to the owner of the font in MST, I decided to go ahead and write this up.&nbsp;</span>I figured everyone understands about pre-beta vs. beta vs. release, and there are probably some people who would be very, very interested to find out about this long-requested feature -- now a part of Windows 8!</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: small;" size="3">I have several people I'll be forwarding this blog to who have been asking for it over the years, and if you know people who have been looking for a good Nastaliq font you should do the same. Enjoy!</span></p>

<hr/><p><strong>John Cowan</strong> on 16 Nov 2011 8:08 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>What&#39;s with the strange effects in the WordPad ribbon?</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 16 Nov 2011 10:21 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Which strange effects?</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Simon Buchan</strong> on 16 Nov 2011 2:24 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>It&#39;s probably worthwhile pointing out that the second Wordpad image is the Arabic Typesetting font, it&#39;s a little confusing with those two as the first introduction :)</p>
<p>That pseudo-ized Arabic LIP looks interesting, I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s designed to show up BiDi and line-height issues? Does Microsoft make it&#39;s pseudo-izations public anywhere? Translations are something we are going to be dealing with soon....</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 16 Nov 2011 3:45 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>I wanted to show the visual distinction between Nastaliq and Naskh. :-)</p>
<p>We do not currently make the pseudo builds public, though it has been requested before and can be considered....</p></div>
<p><strong>Simon Buchan</strong> on 16 Nov 2011 9:40 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Sure, I just meant you have to see the other shots before you know which is which. Re: psuedo, I was more asking about what the pseudo-ization actually does (and why, if it&#39;s not obvious) so we can test that our own text handling and layout is i18n friendly, though the LIP is probably useful for testing in RTL contexts, which would also be nice.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Nasar Malik, Copenhagen, Denmark</strong> on 29 Jan 2012 11:12 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>A great achievement, congratulations.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Sohail Ahmed Siddiqui</strong> on 30 Jan 2012 6:33 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>That&#39;s great. Windows has recently started taking up the issue of Urdu typing, though much belated, it&#39;s a much-awaited and progressive move. I&#39;m eagerly looking forward.</p>

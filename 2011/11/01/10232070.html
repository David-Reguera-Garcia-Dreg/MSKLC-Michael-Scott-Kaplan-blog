<h1>The evolving Story of Locale Support, part 1 (Some people don't want to double-d's)</h1>

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Please forgive the juvenile nature of the blog title; frankly, you deserve better.</em></span></p>
<p>So if&nbsp; you go back to April, Paul Thurrott, was writing about the Windows 8 Lock Screen (<a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/article/windows-7/windows-8-secrets-welcome-screen-130065">right here</a>):</p>
<p><a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/content/content/130065/win8_welcome_m3.jpg"><img style="max-width: 550px;" border="0" alt="" src="http://www.winsupersite.com/content/content/130065/win8_welcome_m3.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>This is Paul's art, I must point out.</p>
<p>At the point where that screenshot was being taken my Windows 8 looked just like my Windows 7, since I did not have one of the magic keys to unlock all the new user interface stuff.</p>
<p>I didn't mind really -- I mean, I liked Windows 7. I could wait a bit.</p>
<p>Now I have no inside knowledge about the welcome screen (that shows up when you boot up), or the lock screen (after you hit &lt;WIN&gt;&lt;L&gt;).</p>
<p>But I will talk about an interesting side issue that led to the fairly inappropriate blog today. :-)</p>
<p>Now when you look at the date and time values, it looks something like</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: courier new,courier;"><strong><span style="font-size: x-large;">hh:mm tt</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: courier new,courier;"><strong><span style="font-size: x-large;">dddd</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: courier new,courier;"><strong><span style="font-size: x-large;">MMM dd</span></strong></span></p>
<p>But it led to an interesting conversation between us and the team doing a bunch of the work here.</p>
<p>The question related to that use of <strong>dd</strong> rather than <strong>d</strong>.</p>
<p>I mean (to delve back into the mildly inappropriate metaphor for a moment), perhaps one can argue that slapping a "double-d" in this situation might be needlessly complex and may be in fact be overkill if a single "d" that would stretch as needed for two digit numbers but remain more slender when one can fit quite comfortably in the thinner numbers.</p>
<p>For me personally, both <strong>November 1</strong> and <strong>November 01</strong> are readable, and neither would feel wrong to me. I mean to say that I care, but neither is wrong to me.</p>
<p>Let's call this the first category of reactions, since it's my reaction!</p>
<p>There are three others:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some people feel very strongly about putting those double d's in there;</li>
<li>Some other people feel equally strongly about single d;</li>
<li>Some other people don't care and think anyone who does is freaking insane.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you look across the gamut of different date formats across all locales, they are all over the map in this regard.</p>
<p>And nowhere within the locale data itself can the answer be found, generally -- there is no way distinguish between categories 2/3, and the other two.</p>
<p>But what if you wanted a feature to always be <strong>Single D</strong> unless people in a given locale generally preferred to be <strong>Double D</strong>?</p>
<p>Well, there some of the question could be indirectly answered by looking at the default date formats and all the defined alternate formats -- e.g. if every single format is <strong>dd</strong> then perhaps one&nbsp;would never want <strong>d</strong> no matter how the feature is designed.</p>
<p>But the locales where&nbsp;we can infer such&nbsp;answers are&nbsp;obvious are&nbsp;limited, and mostly there is no way to know what preference would be..</p>
<p>I mean, other than by explicitly asking the question of some people.</p>
<p>Which, in the end, is what we have to be in the process of doing....</p>
<p>In addition to the formal processes, I figured there is no harm in asking here how people feel about <strong>April 1</strong> versus <strong>April 01</strong>, in your own language (if you tell me, be sure to tell me what your language is, of course!)....</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>For the record, let me point out incredibly grateful that the metaphor of the Double-D brassiere and the "Double-d" date format element could not be reasonably argued, or I may have gone down that road. I've done worse....</em></span></p>
<hr/><p><strong>MNGoldenEagle</strong> on 1 Nov 2011 7:21 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>In the English case, I&#39;d argue for the single D. &nbsp;This is a user interface whose target audience is intended for general users across an entire gamut. &nbsp;We&#39;re not just talking about programmers and engineers, we&#39;re also talking about children, the elderly, technoilliterates, and so on. &nbsp;For these people, when they see a number less than ten they expect that leading zeroes are dropped, otherwise it will look strange to them (&quot;why isn&#39;t the computer smart enough to know it doesn&#39;t need that zero there?&quot;). &nbsp;I can understand why programmers, accountants, and engineers would prefer or be comfortable with leading zeroes, but in general I think the public is more comfortable without. &nbsp;Not to mention it also follows general writing patterns: when you write the date on a check or letter, you don&#39;t include leading zeroes, do you?</p>
</div>
<p><strong>pc</strong> on 1 Nov 2011 7:30 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>As an American, I definitely think of no-leading-zeros as being &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;correct&quot;, and leading-zeros as meaning &quot;a computer somewhere isn&#39;t smart enough to figure out how to format dates without dropping leading zeros&quot;.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Doug Ewell</strong> on 1 Nov 2011 7:45 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>What @MNGoldenEagle said. More precisely: displaying &quot;November 01&quot; in a U.S. English context where the zero isn&#39;t *absolutely necessary* for some reason is just plain silly, and is the kind of thing people used to call &quot;computerese&quot; back before we got inured to computerese.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>John Cowandddd</strong> on 1 Nov 2011 8:08 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>So tell us, Michael, just why is it Double-D and not E? &nbsp;For E it truly is, as indicated by the fact that the next size up is F, followed by G (I have known Fs but not Gs).</p>
<p>I can&#39;t imagine that any locale actually wants dd in a construction like this (as opposed to where you are generating a fixed-length string for sorting or file naming or what not). &nbsp;I can see an artist wanting dd because he (rightly) thinks it looks more &quot;computerish&quot;.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 1 Nov 2011 8:10 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>John, the rules about sizes are clear, unambiguous, and only relevant here due to my immaturity streak!</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 1 Nov 2011 8:29 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>To answer the other point, there are places where people would expect that zero padding. And some were it is their default but they don&#39;t need it here. Thus the interesting quandry!</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Quppa</strong> on 1 Nov 2011 9:09 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>For English, I think I prefer &#39;dd&#39; for aesthetic reasons - the leading zero adds bulk; without it, the single digit might feel lonely out there by itself, separated from the other characters by space. :) There are things in Windows 8 that I feel more strongly about than this, however.</p>
<p>I note that for English (United States), all the default &#39;long date&#39; formats include &#39;dd&#39; (either &#39;MMMM dd&#39; or &#39;dd MMMM&#39;), while in English (Australia), only options with &#39;d MMMM&#39; are available. For English (United Kingdom), both &#39;d MMMM&#39; and &#39;dd MMMM&#39; are present as options. Will Windows 8 take into account the currently selected &#39;long date&#39; format here?</p>
<p>Will CJK users have vertically aligned dates, as in the WP7.1 lock screen? (And will that be optional?) <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.istartedsomething.com/20110507/windows-phone-7-mango-east-asian-language-tidbits/">www.istartedsomething.com/.../windows-phone-7-mango-east-asian-language-tidbits</a></p>
</div>
<p><strong>Alex Cohn</strong> on 1 Nov 2011 1:19 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>For Russian, a genitive form of the month with no leading zero for date is expected, like 1 ноября. But generally speaking, we are discussing the format before the user had a chancr to set her personal preferences for long date format, aren&#39;t we? </p>
</div>
<p><strong>Doug Ewell</strong> on 1 Nov 2011 1:29 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Most users don&#39;t bother to set their personal preferences for long date format, or don&#39;t know it&#39;s possible. It&#39;s one of the first things I do with any computer I&#39;m going to spend any time on (along with setting short date to yyyy-MM-dd and time to H:mm:ss, which I do NOT expect most Americans to do).</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Ruben</strong> on 1 Nov 2011 3:37 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Not sure if my post cane through, so here&#39;s another try.</p>
<p>For Dutch, I&#39;d say a single D. I&#39;ve never seen anything like &quot;Maart 01&quot; -- I&#39;d probably interpret it like March 2001 (more likely I&#39;d be startled by the weird notation). I&#39;ve never seen &quot;Maart 1&quot; either, as neither spoken Dutch nor written Dutch uses month-before-day dates. It&#39;s not US English after all. So both options are wrong for Dutch.</p>
<p>I&#39;d go for &quot;d MMM&quot; (&quot;1 maart&quot;; Dutch doesn&#39;t capitalize day or month names either, unless they start a sentence).</p>
<p>And &quot;hh:mm tt&quot;? Really? Who uses AM/PM these days? (Except, again, those who use US English.) In written Dutch it&#39;s always either HH:mm or H:mm. The 2x12 hour time notation was phased out somewhere in the first half of the twentieth century, I believe. And &quot;AM&quot; and &quot;PM&quot; (or &quot;v.m.&quot; and &quot;n.m.&quot;) were rarely used. And I&#39;d wager that&#39;s true for nearly any language other than US English.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Steve &#39;Sly&#39; Williams</strong> on 1 Nov 2011 4:37 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Windows Phone has done the same thing on its lock screen, so it&#39;s not just new behaviour in Windows 8. &nbsp;The older you are, the more the leading zero on the date looks wrong.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 1 Nov 2011 8:16 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>The scenario isn&#39;t new, but doing it right is!</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Mike Dimmick</strong> on 2 Nov 2011 5:26 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>I&#39;d have to agree with the others; it should be</p>
<p>[Short-Time]</p>
<p>dddd</p>
<p>[Long-Date without year part]</p>
<p>Or even with year part.</p>
<p>Of course you have the problem of whether you present this in the last user&#39;s selected format, or whether it&#39;s in the system default locale. Perhaps use last-logged-on user, unless the policy to not show who last logged on is set, in which case use system default?</p>
</div>
<p><strong>John Cowan</strong> on 2 Nov 2011 9:39 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>[Looks like my comment got lost, unless you are just sitting on it.]</p>
<p>Double-Ds do indeed require zero padding (as do Fs and Gs).</p>

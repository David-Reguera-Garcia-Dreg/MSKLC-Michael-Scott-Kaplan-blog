<h1>Every character has a story #34: PILE OF POO (U+1F4A9). Or not....</h1>

<p>Over in the Suggestion Box, "Eli the Bearded" asked:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I see a need for a Unicode character story behind 'PILE OF POO' (U+1F4A9).</em></p>
<p>Ah yes -- good old U+1f4a9.</p>
<p>U+d83d U+dca9, as a UTF-16 "surrogates pair".</p>
<p>Pictorially, scatologically, this one:</p>
<p></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="http://unicode.org/~scherer/emoji4unicode/fontimg/AEmoji_E4F4.png"><img border="0" alt="PILE OF POO" src="http://unicode.org/~scherer/emoji4unicode/fontimg/AEmoji_E4F4.png" /></a></p>
<p>Originally known as DUNG, or "dog dirt".</p>
<p><span style="font-size: xx-large;">üí©</span></p>
<p>It is one of the Emoji.</p>
<p>And a fun one.</p>
<p>I mean yes, Unicode sold its soul when it agreed to encode the Emoji. And this one has become a fun counter example to every proposed character people have, with the pattern:</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">"They encoded a PILE OF POO but they didn't encode _____________."</span></p>
<p>e.g.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">"They encoded a PILE OF POO but they didn't encode Klingon."</span></p>
<p>It has even had time in Reddit, in a "Maybe they added too much to Unicode 6.0 thread that people had fun with -- you can read it <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/dqgfr/maybe_they_added_too_much_to_unicode_60/">here</a>.</p>
<p>And it is in Windows 8, too.</p>

<p>No weirder than any other Emoji, though. All of it adds up to a PILE OF POO in my book.</p>
<p>I mean, "threads" like <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/flight404/3314811344/">this one</a> nonwithstanding....</p>
<p>I can't do this.&nbsp;I can't.</p>
<p>Some stories are better left untold....</p>

<p>Poo is also used in children anime frequently.</p></div>
<p><strong>Brendan Elliott</strong> on 19 Nov 2011 1:50 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Emoji work a lot better when you already have a built-in system for converting phonetic input to ideographs anyway (e.g. an IME -- reminds me that my favorite method of typing Greek letters is via the Japanese IME -- this is why &#39;beta test&#39; in Japanese is often written as &#39;&beta;„ÉÜ„Çπ„Éà&#39;). They are so commonly used in Japan (especially on cell phones) as basically substitutes for kanji in sentences, that it&#39;s about time that computers got better support for them as they&#39;ve been fairly ubiquitious in Japan as a form of written digital communication for at least 10-15 years now...</p>
<p>Heck, computers are still behind the times compared to cell phones because this is still just a static black &amp; white poo instead one that is in color and animating. &nbsp;The low end phone I used when I studied abroad in Japan in 2002 had color emoji. &nbsp;However, progress is still progress, even when it involves poo. :-)</p></div>

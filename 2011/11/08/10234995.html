</ul>
<p>So after going way off-topic in the last part, I thought I'd come back to the reservation.</p>
<p>Ready?</p>
<p>Every version of Windows -- plus XP SP2 and XP SP3 -- has added new locales.</p>
<p>We've never taken any out, once they've shipped.</p>
<p>And we've only ever removed four sorts (described in <strong><a title="Four exceptions to prove the rule" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/05/07/8464448.html">Four exceptions to prove the rule</a></strong>).</p>
<p>Anyway, so it is hardly breaking news that we added locales in Windows 8.</p>
<p>The full list we've added (already mentioned at the IUC35) is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Central Kurdish (Arabic) - Iraq</li>
<li>Cherokee (Cherokee) - United States</li>
<li>Fulah (Latin) - Senegal</li>
<li>Hawaiian - United States</li>
<li>Punjabi (Arabic) - Pakistan</li>
<li>Setswana - Botswana</li>
<li>Sindhi (Arabic) - Pakistan</li>
<li>Tamil - Sri Lanka</li>
<li>Tigrinya - Ethiopia</li>
<li>Tigrinya - Eritrea</li>
<li>Valencian - Spain</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a very interesting list, for&nbsp;several reasons,&nbsp;one of which is&nbsp;the wide differences in reasons each one was added.</p>
<p>In particular, there are several here that I am quite pleased about, all of which I recused myself most of the justification conversations&nbsp;because I was personally rooting for them and didn't want an inappropriate bias to take away from my advocacy...</p>
<p>Now these aren't UI languages mind you -- these are just locales -- though as I pointed out earlier, locales are huge. It takes your breath away the first time you see your locale on the Standards and Formats list -- I know because I've witnessed it several times over the years (more on this another time).</p>
<p>So they&nbsp;are cool on their on,&nbsp;and I'll give part of the list of why I think a few of them are especially cool:</p>
<p>There is <strong>Central Kurdish (Arabic) -&nbsp;Iraq</strong>, which allowed me to be proven wrong about my earlier statements almost 2.5 years ago in <strong><a title="The Whey doesn't get a locale, either" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2009/05/26/9641049.html">The Whey doesn't get a locale, either</a></strong>.</p>
<p>And there is <strong>Tamil - Sri Lanka</strong>, which allows me to be a part of keeping ~1/3 of my promises about Tamil locales in Windows.</p>
<p>And there is <strong>Hawaiian (United States)</strong>, which I despondently assumed would never be added, for no reason I could fathom, until the decision was made to not&nbsp;refuse to add it....</p>
<p><em>For the record, I'll say that <a href="http://blog.msdn.com/b/shawnste">Shawn Steele</a>'s advocacy of Hawaiian was a&nbsp;definite factor in its approval -- at the point where we asked about it, we were past the point of expecting to succeeed; we were like the Chicago Cubs (assuming we already lost), which made the approval all the more sweet!</em></p>
<p>There is more here that is interesting and fun, which I'll be covering in future parts of the series....</p>
<hr/><p><strong>Ghaffari</strong> on 2 Mar 2012 12:34 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Just installed Windows 8 consumer preview and was glad to see the Sindhi (Arabic) locale. But also shocked to see that it didn&#39;t contain Sindhi keyboard layout. How good is a locale without a keyboard? And more funny that it doesn&#39;t show the already installed (I upgraded from win7) personal Sindhi keyboard in the list of keyboards for Arabic script. I can&#39;t even choose the existing keyboard.</p>
<p>I will request to kindly fix this and include the Sindhi keyboard layout designed by Majid Bhurgri in the Release version of Win8.</p>
<p>Thanks for the locale at least.</p>

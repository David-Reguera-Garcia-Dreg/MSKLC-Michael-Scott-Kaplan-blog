<p>As the Unicode 6.1 beta marched along happily, Peter Constable noticed and asked the following:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;"><em>In UnicodeData.txt (both 6.0 and 6.1 beta), why is the bidi category of 1F48C LOVE LETTER set to L rather than ON? By design, or (I'm guessing) a bug?</em></span></p>
<p>And Ken Whistler jumped in with&nbsp;the&nbsp;answer and explanation:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">It is an artifact of the heuristic which is used to assign initial values to </span><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">the 1000+ new entries typically appearing for a new version of </span><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">UnicodeData.txt for a release. That heuristic guesses that </span><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">a character with "LETTER" in its name is a letter, and assigns </span><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">initial Bidi_Class properties accordingly, before I go through </span><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">attempting to find </span><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">all the exceptions manually and correcting them.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">Apparently both I and everybody else missed this during the </span><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">beta review for Unicode 6.0. This clearly is a bug, and should </span><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">be fixed for 6.1. I'd suggest dropping a short note in the hopper </span><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">as feedback on PRI #206, so we don't lose track of this and remember to </span><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">get it fixed along with anything else that turns up in the data files.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">BTW, when you report that one, there is another with the exact </span><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">same problem:</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">U+1F524 INPUT SYMBOL FOR LATIN *LETTER*S</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">which is also bc=L, instead of the expected bc=ON.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">Cf.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">U+1F520 INPUT SYMBOL FOR LATIN CAPITAL LETTERS</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">which *did* get corrected, and is the expected bc=ON.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">--Ken</span></p>
<p>Now obviously, the heuristic Ken refers to here could easily be improved.</p>
<p>For example, if it says LETTER with nothing after it, then maybe it's a love letter, versus an actual letter.</p>
<p>And again, for example, if it has the word SYMBOL in it, then perhaps that would override it having the word LETTER in it.</p>
<p>And so on.</p>
<p>You get the idea....</p>

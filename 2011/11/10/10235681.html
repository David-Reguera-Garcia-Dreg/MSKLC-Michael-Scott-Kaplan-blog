<p>Over in the Suggestion Box, Aakash Mehendale asked:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Today's DailyWTF has an image of a newspaper article in which the text has come out mangled with a mangling I've never seen before. It seems to have become *mostly* x and z. Any ideas on what's happened here? Bad OCR? Some really oddball re-encoding issue?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">" rel="nofollow" target="_new"&gt;thedailywtf.com/.../~QCCmp2Txt~.aspx</p>
<p>I can't find the article in question about the mangling.</p>
<p>Because, as may have noticed, my Blog seems to have mangled the text.</p>
<p>I don't know what to do with it now.</p>
<p>Except maybe revel in the irony?</p>
<p>I didn't do it myself, but I seem to have lost some info here...</p>

<p><strong>Van</strong> on 10 Nov 2011 2:20 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>The headline and the few pieces of text in italic are unharmed. Is it possible that a physical printing wheel of some sort was installed wrong?</p>

<p><strong>Simon Buchan</strong> on 11 Nov 2011 2:57 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Printing presses print from full-page plates, so a physical muck-up seems unlikely. Looks to me like the printer uses PostScript or PDF the regular font had broken glyph mapping; either a corrupt embedded font or, less likely, fall-back incorrectly applied (assuming identical glyph-ids or something).</p>

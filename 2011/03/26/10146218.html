<h1>An over-complexity worthy of an ISO standard</h1>

<p>Mark Davis noticed something amiss:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;"><em>As I recall, ISO said that they were not going to reuse codes for 50 years.<br />But BQ has just been reused, and I don't think it has been 50 years since it<br />had the old meaning.</em></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/pressrelease.htm?refid=Ref1383"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;"><em>http://www.iso.org/iso/pressrelease.htm?refid=Ref1383</em></span></a></p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;"><em>Mark</em></span></p>
<p>Some might remember the crazy time of the "CS which was <strong>Czechoslovakia</strong> and then <strong>Serbia and Montenegro</strong>" reassignment debacle.</p>
<p>The idea of "we won't reuse for 50 years" sounded vaguely familiar to me, too.</p>
<p>Though to be honest it sounded way too easy for the rules of an ISO standard!</p>
<p>And indeed it would have been. If you look at the second article aboute the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2">ISO-3166-1 alpha-2</a> codes, you will see a framework worthy of an ISO standard!</p>
<p>Basically, there are some "reserved" elements:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">Reserved code elements are codes which have become obsolete, or are required in order to enable a particular user application of the standard but do not qualify for inclusion in ISO 3166-1. To avoid transitional application problems and to aid users who require specific additional code elements for the functioning of their coding systems, the ISO 3166/MA, when justified, reserves these codes which it undertakes not to use for other than specified purposes during a limited or indeterminate period of time. The reserved alpha-2 codes can be divided into the following four categories: exceptional reservations, transitional reservations, indeterminate reservations, and codes currently agreed not to use.</span></p>
<p>So there you go, four categories of reserved:</p>
<ul>
<li>exceptional reservations</li>
<li>transitional reservations</li>
<li>indeterminate reservations</li>
<li>codes currently agreed not to use</li>
</ul>
<p>And of course a mechanism to represent formerly deleted codes which may then be reassigned &nbsp;in ISO-639-3. </p>
<p>So that the historical info is held onto in a way that they believe is acceptable even though it freaks all of us out a bit.</p>
<p>Like I said, worthy of an ISO standard!</p>
<p>A little of the CS mess is covered by me in blogs like <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2010/08/04/10045672.html" title="My aren't we looking quite Bosnianesque?"><strong>My aren't we looking quite Bosnianesque?</strong></a> and <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2010/08/09/10047417.html" title="{Insert a pun about the word Serbian here, I can't think of one}"><strong>{Insert a pun about the word Serbian here, I can't think of one}</strong></a>. I am sure there are people in Microsoft who weondered what tehy got themselves into by using <span style="text-decoration: line-through;"><span style="color: #808080;">RFC 1766</span></span><span style="text-decoration: line-through;"><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">RFC 3066</span></span>BCP-47 tags for their locale names. Both for self-caused CHS/CHT vs hant/hans issues and for ISO-caused problems like the CS debacle.</p>
<p>One day we may even miss LCIDs (some people aren't even aware that <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/07/23/4021529.html" title="LCIDs suck"><strong>LCIDs suck</strong></a>, yet!)....</p>
<hr/><p><strong>Doug Ewell</strong> on 28 Mar 2011 7:12 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>BQ was never a BCP 47 subtag, having been withdrawn from ISO 3166 in 1979, long before the January 1995 (= RFC 1766) cutoff point. Thus Microsoft hasn&#39;t &quot;got themselves into&quot; anything by using BCP 47 tags.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Doug Ewell</strong> on 29 Mar 2011 12:16 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>That said, it escapes me why ISO 3166/MA would choose *any* previously used code element. BC, BK, and BP seem no less mnemonic than BQ for &quot;Bonaire, Saint Eustatius and Saba,&quot; and the MA has already said (repeatedly) that no promises of mnemonic value are made for the alpha-2 code elements anyway.</p>

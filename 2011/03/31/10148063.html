<p>So the question the other day was interesting:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;"><em>I see that the OOB number field only allows English numerals and doesn&rsquo;t allow say for example Arabic numerals. Is there a general rule we follow here or is this true only for the OOB number field. The reason I ask is that we have a feature called the &lsquo;storefront&rsquo; and they have a text box which takes number of seats as input. Now a user in Saudi Arabia might not know the English numerals. How do we expect the end user experience to be like for those users?</em></span></p>
<p>Now if you are a regular reader you may know why I found this interesting.</p>
<p>After all, there is my <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2010/11/12/10088056.html" title="Suddenly, in a bit more time than a blink of an eye, &quot;standards support&quot; becomes &quot;less i18n support&quot;"><strong>Suddenly, in a bit more time than a blink of an eye, "standards support" becomes "less i18n support"</strong></a> blog, where I pointed out how IE decided to start moving out of the digit substitution business.</p>
<p>For the ironic point in the question asked above -- since all of the Arabic keyboards we ship depend on digit substitution to show the "Hindi" digits, the answer to the question is easy: the web page probably won't support the notion of any normal user being able to type those other digits, ever.</p>
<p>So technically it isn't a scenario.</p>
<p>I have a colleague who works in this area who mentioned to me the other day:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="font-size: medium;">Digit substitution is maybe a tolerable hack for displaying UI, but it&rsquo;s definitely bad if you&rsquo;re creating content.</span></em></p>
<p>(And getting worse all the time!)</p>
<p>There you have it. Maybe we're moving away from digit substitution.</p>
<p>It's not like browsers are exactly going out of style, right?</p>
<p>But how come nobody is doing the work to improve support for</p>
<ul>
<li>text entry</li>
<li>text parsing</li>
<li>text formatting</li>
</ul>
<p>to support these non- ASCII digits, if we are truly moving away from digit substitution?</p>
<p>It seems like someone forgot to tag second base here, didn't they?</p>
<p>All I'd like to know is what the future is gonna need to look like. Since people like me may evenb own own a piece of what will contribute to that future, someone needs to be pushing for a plan here -- so that I can do my part to contribute to that future plan...</p>
<p>Perhaps the answer is to do nothing, not give users a good way to type the other types of digits, and then use the lack of documents with the digits as proof that no one is using them. </p>
<p>I'd like to think we're better than that, though....</p>

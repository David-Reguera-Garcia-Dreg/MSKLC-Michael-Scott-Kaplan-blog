<h1>Both Google *and* Bing fail to support accessibility, dammit!</h1>

<p>This blog is about two issues -- one that affects me much more personally than the other.</p>
<p><em><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: I work for Microsoft, the company behind Bing. And I did once interview with Google (the company that finally paid my travel expenses for the interview!).</span></em></p>
<p>I'll start with the one than affects me more, since I have been assured by someone i trust that [at least here in the Blog] it <strong>is</strong> all about me....</p>
<p>Previously, in <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2010/09/11/10060633.html" title="Once upon a time, you could earn my loyalty, for up to 24 hours at a time"><strong>Once upon a time, you could earn my loyalty, for up to 24 hours at a time</strong></a>, I pointed out I had mostly moved to Bing finally. And that the one thing I still used Google for was its integration with bus routes.</p>
<p>Not too long after that, Bing picked up the bus route schedule stuff too, and now Google's one place for we was the built-in app on the Pam Pre that worked better than Bing via the web on that ultra-small form factor (Google on the web would have sucked too, but they did have the app).</p>
<p>So anyway, all was well and good.</p>
<p>Almost.</p>
<p>In actuality, all three <strong>Bus Schedule Integration </strong>solutions (Bing Maps via the web, Google via the web, and Google via the Palm Pre app) sucked in one specific way, a way that the <a href="http://tripplanner.kingcounty.gov/cgi-bin/itin_page.pl?resptype=U">King County Metro Trip Planner</a> didn't suck at all.</p>
<p>With these various integrated solutions, there is no option to request an accessible trip.</p>
<p><a href="http://tripplanner.kingcounty.gov/cgi-bin/itin_page.pl?resptype=U"><img src="http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer-Blogs-Components-WeblogFiles/00-00-00-33-81/5850.metro.jpg" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;This hurts me in two specific ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>The last 545 stop on the city side of the water is the Montlake stop, and it is not accessible (it is like over two flights worth of stairs, and I don't know if my iBot battery can take that at the end of the night, and pre-iBot my multiple sclerosis could require me to choose a more accessible stop!). This makes all three solutions fundamentally useless for at least a third of the trips home I navigate, as this stop is&nbsp;a common focal point for trips to Redmond. In&nbsp;the time required to mentally determine a compatible stop for the myriad of routes to get me to Montlake, I can be hope already by using the <a href="http://tripplanner.kingcounty.gov/cgi-bin/itin_page.pl?resptype=U">King County Metro Trip Planner</a>, which is pretty much what I do;</li>
<li>Other trips sometimes have a few stops that aren't accessible and run into the same problem. On the glass-half-full side it is less often, on the glass-half-empty side, I am screwed when it happens, to varying degrees.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yet either one includes lots of other options, so omitting these other choices (especially the accessible trip option but all three are useful if one has a mobility handicap!) really, really sucks.</p>
<p>Summary: <strong>Both Google and Bing suck in this regard. And they SUCK HUGE.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;Okay, now there is the other problem.</p>
<p>And that problem is that if you ignore features 4,5, and 6 of the <a href="http://tripplanner.kingcounty.gov/cgi-bin/itin_page.pl?resptype=U">King County Metro Trip Planner</a>, both Google and Bing are only as good as the <a href="http://tripplanner.kingcounty.gov/cgi-bin/itin_page.pl?resptype=U">King County Metro Trip Planner</a>. </p>
<p>And no better.</p>
<p>Yet there is the service provided by&nbsp;sites like <a href="http://onebusaway.org/">One Bus Away</a>, which give live tracking info of where the buses actually are (<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/">Raymond</a> mentioned it a while back, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/02/17/9427102.aspx">here</a>).</p>
<p>These Bing/Google apps do nothing other than tell you where they ought to be if they follow the schedule. But in a city that spends a lot of its time running 1-20 minutes late (and occasionally 10 minutes early, as I have learned the hard way!), the data of <strong>what is</strong> rather than one <strong>might be in theory</strong> is pretty much indispensable.</p>
<p>Now <a href="http://onebusaway.org/">One Bus Away</a>&nbsp;is I believe still largely based on <a href="http://mybus.org/">mybus.org</a>, and thus like with the first problem they could work to integrate the data here if they so chose -- either with the source or with One Bus Away.</p>
<p>King County Metro has a <a href="http://metro.kingcounty.gov/oltools/tracker.html">Tracker</a>, too. So there are a lot of options.</p>
<p>Integration&nbsp;can be&nbsp;a complicated problem, but at a minimum a special addition of the live data that could let you know if the suggested route is doomed would be nice (taking it a step further to suggest timely alternatives would be more difficult given limits on what i available, but the time to integrate just the data here would be really nice.</p>
<p>There is at least a mitigation here: I can run both one of the integrated apps/sites and <a href="http://onebusaway.org/">One Bus Away</a>&nbsp;(which even has a <strong>Bus Tracker</strong>app on the Palm Pre!), or in my case all three since I am forced to also use the <a href="http://tripplanner.kingcounty.gov/cgi-bin/itin_page.pl?resptype=U">King County Metro Trip Planner</a>&nbsp;site. But despite the Palm Pre's WebOS being able to multitask, I find the Google app to be pretty flaky about memory usage, which can make running both of them let alone all three of them hard.</p>
<p>Summary:&nbsp;<strong>Yet again, both Bing and Google suck in their bus integration, in this case Google a bit more than Bing.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>So why do both Google and Bing let me down here. I'm not sure, but both of them have a <strong>very high suckage factor</strong>, especially on their refusal to support the built-in information that their source provides on accessibility.</p>
<p>Maybe they both could do a little something here. If they manage to do so and thereby stop sucking, I'll mention it.</p>
<p>And for now I'll use three sites, since&nbsp;no one site has proven able to do the job&nbsp;</p>
<hr/><p><strong>GregM</strong> on 29 Mar 2011 7:39 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>I like your choice of phone. &nbsp;Judging by the memory usage comment, I assume you&#39;re using an original Pre on Sprint. &nbsp;I can count on one hand the number of times I&#39;ve run into the too many cards error on my Pre Plus, so if/when you upgrade to a 2 or 3, that issue should disappear.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 29 Mar 2011 7:44 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Indeed, it is the original Palm Pre. Though really it is only with the Google maps app involved that I hit it (and the browser won&#39;t hit the website -- it forces the app if you go to the site)....</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Richard</strong> on 29 Mar 2011 11:13 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Of course, the *real* suckage is that there are any non-accessible stops in the first place! :D</p>
</div>
<p><strong>BlindUser</strong> on 29 Mar 2011 2:28 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>I am a blind user and use a screen reader and unlike Google, Bing is inaccessible in its Maps, because they use a Silverlight application whose implementation is inaccessible to the screen reader, its Video Search is harder than Google&#39;s because it uses no HTML headings and ARIA landmarks, its Entertainment Search is overloaded and makes my screen reader run so slow that I can&#39;t use it at all plus the page dynamically changes under you, its Web Search is fine but has more things at the top than Google that I have to skip over and its Feedback form is inconsistent and both with its History pages after you give feedback or enable/disable history it does not return you to your previous page but you are forced to press back on your browser 3-4 times. MSN.com is also very inaccessible as it is overloaded, changes all the time, has no logical hierarchy of information that I can easily learn and remember, is full of seemingly spam text maskarating as news or shopping and in general its design interface is not intuitive from the accessibility standpoint. Bing/Live Search and MSN have been like this for some years. Why isn&#39;t anybody listening and fixing things?</p></div>
<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 29 Mar 2011 6:33 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Silverlight itself has support for screen readers (ref <a href="http://www.silverlight.net/learn/quickstarts/accessibility/#ScreenReaderSupport">here</a>, for example) but it looks like the maps aren&#39;t using it in Bing....</p></div>

<h1>Those who don't learn from their mistakes are bound to break the Turkish "I" again</h1>

<p>I've said it before: the Turkic folks have it right.</p>
<p>I mean, if we had these four letters in our alphabet:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-family: Courier New;">I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;U+0049&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I</span> </li>
<li><span style="font-family: Courier New;">i&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;U+0069&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LATIN SMALL LETTER I</span> </li>
<li><span style="font-family: Courier New;">İ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;U+0130&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I WITH DOT ABOVE</span> </li>
<li><span style="font-family: Courier New;">ı&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;U+0131&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LATIN SMALL LETTER DOTLESS I</span></li>
</ol>
<p>then we'd case things the way that they do (dots with dots, dotless with dotless).</p>
<p>We really would.</p>
<p>Now the notion that we have now learned our lesson about the Turkish I and that we could do the right thing by default for Turkish is one that I hear from time to time.</p>
<p>I heard it&nbsp;over&nbsp;10 years ago&nbsp;when I and many others agreed that the behavior could finally be 'fixed" in Windows XP. The major wininet cache bug that came out of the change was a really impressive tip of an iceberg (since tips are not generally expected to have as much influence on their own).</p>
<p>A bunch of people heard it before that when they created a default behavior for .Net that made .Net 1.0 an unusable&nbsp;security nightmare on Turkish and Azeri that took a division wide "everyone review code" break to produce a .Net 1.1 that didn't suck the same way.</p>
<p>Now there haven't been any extreme cases since then, but even these days at least six times a year I have someone come to me and bemoan some particular aspect of the native or managed behavior and how they don't understand why developers couldn't just solve the problem the way <strong>their</strong> customers did.</p>
<p>And then of course they explain their solution, which either doesn't really fix the bug because they misunderstood the problem, or it causes another problem. Or multiple other problems.</p>
<p>And then I realize&nbsp;that I am&nbsp;absolutely nowhere if my goal is truly to have all of this be intutive or at least understandable.</p>
<p>Probably just as well that goal didn't go in my commitments....</p>
<p>On a less serious but much more fun note, I'm heading out to Comicon today, and I will be there for Venice is Sinking tonight. And try to forget about all of this until next week.</p>

<p>What do fonts and keyboards have in common?</p>
<p>Other than the fact that I talk about both of them here from time to time, I mean.</p>
<p>Though after so many thousands of blogs written here, it might be unwise to ignore that fact. :-)</p>
<p>What they have in common is the way that in both cases people decided that their creation really ought to succeed.</p>
<p>No matter what.</p>
<p>Thus you can call </p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">HKL hkl = LoadKeyboardLayoutW(L"CRAP BAG", KLF_ACTIVATE);</span></strong></p>
<p>and your crap bag of a keyboard layout call will succeed.</p>
<p>(As previously discussed in <strong><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/12/10/9189637.html" title="LoadKeyboardLayout is a 00bada55 puppy dog tail wagger of a function">LoadKeyboardLayout is a 00bada55 puppy dog tail wagger of a function</a></strong>)</p>
<p>Similarly, the font mapper has the job of returning a font when you ask for one.</p>
<p>It may do the job very poorly by the metric of "meeting expectations" if your request cannot be matched closely enough. By some metric of closeness.</p>
<p>There are even whole articles devoted to this topic, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/230342">KB article 230342: How To Determine When Font Creation Was Successful</a></li>
<li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms969909.aspx">Windows Font Mapping (by Ron Gery)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Now in addition to the interesting "name" issues, there are the size issues I discussed previously in blogs like <strong><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/09/21/765438.html" title="Font sizes vary more than one might expect">Font sizes vary more than one might expect</a></strong>&nbsp;and <strong><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/02/28/7934894.html" title="Font size scaling -- GDI vs. GDI+">Font size scaling -- GDI vs. GDI+</a></strong>.</p>
<p>It is quite easy to not get exactly what you expected. But this is not a bug -- any more than </p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">HFONT hFont = CreateFontW(..., L"CRAP BAG");</span></strong></p>
<p>returning a valid HFONT is not a bug.....</p>
<p>Of course interestingly, those particular calls to pick up the "CRAP BAG" font and keyboard don't promse any particular compatibility with each other!</p>

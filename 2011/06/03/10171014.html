<h1>Oops! (aka Locking yourself out of Windows)</h1>
<p><em>by Michael S. Kaplan, published on 2011/06/03 14:01 +00:00, original URI: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/michkap/archive/2011/06/03/10171014.aspx</em></p>

<p>Conceptually, it is a bit like locking yourself out of your car (by locking it up with the keys inside).</p>
<p> But it is easy to do it -- change your password and include characters in the password that are not included on the keyboards you have for your logon screen.</p>
<p><em>See <strong><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/01/07/348944.html" title="Updating the keyboard list in the logon dialog">Updating the keyboard list in the logon dialog</a></strong> for more on how to update the keyboard list of the logon screen -- how to get caught short here with a password containing letters nor on any of those keyboards is left as an exercise for the absent-minded!</em> </p>

<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma">This problem is also caused by a scenario that I found common personally when the first internal betas of MSKLC became available, actually.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma">It seems people would create keyboards that did not contain all of the letters in the password they had.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma">And this was back in the XP days where you might already be in session 0,and that keyboard change might be followed by being unable to unlock the computer or login after a reboot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma">This ended up becoming quite an interesting "support" issue for those early MSKLC builds!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma">And now for today's interesting problem for all you readers....</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-family:Tahoma">Think of it as a Microsoft interview question that I would never ask, except maybe if it was for a test position and I really wanted to test the ability to think outside the logon box. :-)</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma">The question: how would you get them back into their machine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma">Scoring will be as follows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family:Tahoma">0 points for a solution that would not work (if it is creative enough I might give some points for it).</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:Tahoma">5 points for the solution that the person at the Microsoft Help Desk suggested.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:Tahoma">10 points for any of the solutions that I or someone came up with that seemed kind of boring or ho-hum.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:Tahoma">15 points for any of the solutions that I or someone came up with that would work but that could be rather labor-intensive.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:Tahoma">25 points for any of the solutions that I or someone came up with that seemed kind of brilliant.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:Tahoma">50 points for any solution that hasn't ever been suggested to or thought of by me for solving this problem.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma">Some time next week I&#39;ll do the roundup with my scoring decisions (which are are arbitrary and final!) and any interesting methods that are missed....</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma">Ready? Set? Go!</span></p>

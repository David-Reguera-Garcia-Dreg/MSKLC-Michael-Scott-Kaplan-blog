<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>This is gonna be a weird one. Not a tehnical one. But a technically weird one, in some sense....</em></span></p>
<p>I'm going to introduce my story I am going to tell with someone else's story. A story from <strong>So long, and Thanks For All The Fish</strong>.</p>
<p>I won't claim that my story will be as funny, or as fun. But it may put you in the right frame of mind to read the story I will tell you....</p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"I'll tell you a story," said Arthur.</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"Good."</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">They found a patch of grass which was relatively free of couples actually lying on top of each other and sat and watched the stunning ducks and the low sunlight rippling on the water which ran beneath the stunning ducks.</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"A story," said Fenchurch, cuddling his arm to her.</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"Which will tell you something of the sort of things that happen to me. It's absolutely true."</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"True Story."</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"You know sometimes people tell you stories that are supposed to be something that happened to their wife's cousin's best friend, but actually probably got made up somewhere along the line.</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"Well, it's like one of those stories, except that it actually happened, and I know it actually happened, because the person it actually happened to was me."</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"Like the raffle ticket.", said Fenchurch.</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">Arthur laughed. "Yes. I had a train to catch," he went on. "I arrived at the station&hellip;"</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"Did I ever tell you," interrupted Fenchurch, "what happened to my parents in a station?"</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"Yes," said Arthur, "you did."</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"Just checking."</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">Arthur glanced at his watch. "I suppose we could think of getting back," he said.</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"Tell me the story," said Fenchurch firmly. "You arrived at the station."</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"I was about twenty minutes early. I'd got the time of the train wrong. I suppose it is at least equally possible," he added after a moment's reflection, "that British Rail had got the time of the train wrong. Hadn't occurred to me before."</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"Get on with it." Fenchurch laughed.</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"So I bought a newspaper, to do the crossword, and went to the buffet to get a cup of coffee."</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"You do the crossword?"</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"Yes."</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"Which one?"</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"</span></em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">The Guardian</span><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;"> usually."</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"I think it tries to be too cute. I prefer </span></em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">The Times</span><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">. Did you solve it?"</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"What?"</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"The crossword in </span></em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">T</span><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">he Guardian</span><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">."</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"I haven't had a chance to look at it yet," said Arthur, "I'm still trying to buy the coffee."</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"All right then. Buy the coffee."</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"I'm buying it. I am also," said Arthur, "buying some biscuits."</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"What sort?"</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"Rich Tea."</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"Good choice."</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"I like them. Laden with all these new possessions, I go and sit at a table. And don't ask me what the table was like because this was some time ago and I can't remember. It was probably round."</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"All right."</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"So, let me give you the layout. Me sitting at the table. On my left, the newspaper. On my right, the cup of coffee. In the middle of the table, the packet of biscuits."</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"I see it perfectly."</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"What you don't see," said Arthur, "because I haven't mentioned him yet, is the guy sitting at the table already. He is sitting there opposite me."</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"What's he like?"</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"Oh, perfectly ordinary. Briefcase. Business suit. He didn't look," said Arthur, "as if he was about to do anything weird."</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"Ah, I know the type. What did he do?"</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"He did this. He leaned across the table, picked up the packet of biscuits, tore it open, took one out, and&hellip;"</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"</span></em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">What</span><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">?"</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"Ate it."</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"What?"</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"He ate it."</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">Fenchurch looked at him in astonishment. "What on Earth did you do?"</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"Well, in the circumstances I did what any red-blooded Englishman would do. I was compelled," said Arthur, "to ignore it."</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"</span></em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">What</span><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">? Why?"</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"Well, it's not the sort of thing you're trained for is it? I searched my soul, and discovered that there was nothing anywhere in my upbringing, experience or even primal instincts to tell me how to react to someone who has quite simply, calmly, sitting right there in front of me, stolen one of my biscuits."</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"Well, you could&hellip;" Fenchurch thought about it. "I must say I'm not sure what I would have done either. So what happened?"</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"I stared furiously at the crossword," said Arthur. "Couldn't do a single clue, took a sip of coffee, it was too hot to drink, so there was nothing for it. I braced myself. I took a biscuit, trying very hard not to notice," he added, "that the packet was already mysteriously open&hellip;"</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"But you're fighting back, taking a tough line."</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"After my fashion, yes. I ate the biscuit. I ate it very deliberately and visibly, so that he would have no doubt as to what it was I was doing. When I eat a biscuit," Arthur said, "it stays eaten."</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"So what did he do?"</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"Took another one. Honestly," insisted Arthur, "this is exactly what happened. He took another biscuit, he ate it. Clear as daylight. Certain as we are sitting on the ground."</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">Fenchurch stirred uncomfortably.</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"And the problem was," said Arthur, "that having not said anything the first time, it was somehow even more difficult to broach the subject the second time around. What do you say? &lsquo;Excuse me&hellip; I couldn't help noticing, er&hellip;' Doesn't work. No, I ignored it with, if anything, even more vigour than previously."</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"My man&hellip;"</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"Stared at the crossword, again, still couldn't budge a bit of it, so showing some of the spirit that Henry V did on St Crispin's Day&hellip;"</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"What?"</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"I went into the breach again. I took," said Arthur, "another biscuit. And for an instant our eyes met."</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"Like this?"</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"Yes, well, no, not quite like that. But they met. Just for an instant. And we both looked away. But I am here to tell you," said Arthur, "that there was a little electricity in the air. There was a little tension building up over the table. At about this time."</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"I can imagine."</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"We went through the whole packet like this. Him, me, him, me&hellip;"</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"The whole packet?"</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"Well it was only eight biscuits but it seemed like a lifetime of biscuits we were getting through at this point. Gladiators could hardly have had a tougher time."</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"Gladiators," said Fenchurch, "would have had to do it in the sun. More physically grueling."</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"There is that. So. When the empty packet was lying dead between us the man at last got up, having done his worst, and left. I heaved a sigh of relief, of course. As it happened, my train was announced a moment or two later, so I finished my coffee, stood up, picked up the newspaper, and underneath the newspaper&hellip;"</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"Yes?"</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"Were </span></em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">my</span><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;"> biscuits."</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"What?" said Fenchurch. "</span></em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">What</span><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">?"</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"True."</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"No!" She gasped and tossed herself back on the grass laughing.</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">She sat up again.</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"You completely nitwit," she hooted, "you almost completely and utterly foolish person."</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">She pushed him backwards, rolled over him, kissed him and rolled off again. He was surprised at how light she was.</span></em></p>
<p>Okay. So now I will tell you my story. It won't be as interesting, I promise you.</p>
<p>Though it is indeed a story about the sort of things that happen to me, and it is completely true. And I know&nbsp;this,&nbsp;because the person it actually happened to was me.</p>
<p>I have a mailslot at work.</p>
<p>Now I get hundreds of emails every day (not including spam), but very little physical snail mail is sent to me at work.</p>
<p>In fact, the occasional times I go to clean out the stuff that builds up over time, it is just a little bit of junk mail. I dump it right into the recycle bin that&nbsp;is conveniently located in the same room.</p>
<p><em>You can likely see why my visits to clean out the mailslot are so rare. </em></p>
<p>The other day is when it was not going to turn out to be an ordinary trip to the mailslot.</p>
<p>Buried with the announcements about conferences I would never go to, products I would never use, and&nbsp;other such junk mail, there was a wedding invitation.</p>
<p><strong>A Wedding Invitation.</strong> </p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>A Wedding Invitation.</strong></span></p>
<p>It was for the daughter of&nbsp;a former colleague of mine.</p>
<p>He and I did do some work together, though we were never terribly close.</p>
<p><em>He recommended&nbsp;I may not&nbsp;be a&nbsp;good fit when I was thinking about&nbsp;joining&nbsp;a team&nbsp;he was on a few years prior.&nbsp;That kind of thing&nbsp;is easy enough for me to look past in work situations, but it doesn't tend to encourage social interactions outside of work, if you know what I mean.</em></p>
<p>Anyway, the wedding was out of state.</p>
<p>I don't ever recall meeting the daughter, and I know I had never met the son-in-law to be.</p>
<p>I had never been to the former colleague's house, and he had never been to mine, which&nbsp;I guess explains why the invitation was sent to me at work.</p>
<p>He didn't know my address!</p>
<p>On the other hand, it explain nothing -- as it all kind of indicates the reasoning for not sending an invitation (when one doesn't know someone).</p>
<p>Probably would have been worth a call at least, so I'd know it was coming.</p>
<p>I had a not entirely comfortable moment where I did a mental back and forth and forth about what to do -- whether to go, whether to decline, whether to send a gift, etc. -- I have definitely been known to show up in unexpected situations before, so a wedding I was invited to would hardly be <em>too </em>weird. Though the chance I might decide to randomly make the trip might be an argument against the invitation, if you ask me -- I can be pretty unconventional. So my mind was working through all the possibilities, in that moment.</p>
<p>Before&nbsp;I noticed that the wedding had already happened, months earlier.</p>
<p><em>You may recall&nbsp;I&nbsp;told you I didn't check my mailslot very often!</em> </p>
<p>I did go down the hall and ask another colleague who used to be on that same team, but it turns out they hadn't been invited. We speculated on the topic for a few moments and, and they suggested some theories about the whole matter.</p>
<p>"<strong>So you don't think it's weird?</strong>" I asked.</p>
<p>"<strong>Oh no, it's weird,</strong>"&nbsp;they responded.</p>
<p>But what to do next?</p>
<p>Miss Manners has probably covered the subject of the strange invitation before, right? Someone has to know what he right response would have been.</p>
<p>Or what it should be now, if anything....</p>
<p>In the end,&nbsp;I couldn't think of a way to respond after not responding in a timely manner.</p>
<p>So I figured I do the next best thing -- I'd write a blog about it!</p>
<p>I'll see what I can do about ending on the same note as the Arthur Dent story. You know, finding a girl to push me backwards, roll over me, kiss me, and roll off again. It'll probably have to wait until the weekend, at least....</p>
<hr/><p><strong>John Cowan</strong> on 16 Jun 2011 9:59 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>You can&#39;t have been much missed. &nbsp;Some people seem to send out 1000 invitations so they can get 400 guests.</p>
<p>Me, I don&#39;t get it. &nbsp;Gale and I invited 32 people, making it clear that the invitations were *not* extensible. &nbsp;One showed up with his partner anyway. &nbsp;Two didn&#39;t show up at all, and we never found out why. &nbsp;One showed up with her four-year-old -- but we hadn&#39;t expected her to make it at all, and when we found out she had actually hitched a ride on a private plane, we were fine with it. &nbsp;Even if the kid did ram his whole hand into the as-yet-uncut birthday cake.</p>

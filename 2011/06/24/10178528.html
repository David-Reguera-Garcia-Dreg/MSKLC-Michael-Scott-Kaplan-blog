<h1>An irresistible force walks into an immovable object (aka the Thai that binds us)</h1>

<p>It dates back to some time between when Windows XP shipped and Windows Server 2003 shipped.</p>
<p>Suddenly, in&nbsp;a wee bit longer than a blink of an eye, it was determined that Microsoft's essentially promiscuous use of both the Unicode PUA (private use area) and unpaired Unicode surrogates were not only bad and/or wrong -- they were in some situations potential security issues.</p>
<p>This was kind of the point of <strong><a title="Keeping out the undesirables?" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/05/31/612544.html">Keeping out the undesirables?</a></strong>&nbsp;and similar blogs.</p>
<p>Now if you ask me, we went a little overboard on this one, which is the theme of <strong><a title="The torrents of U+fffd (aka When security and conformance trump compatibility and reality)" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/09/17/4950277.html">The torrents of U+fffd (aka When security and conformance trump compatibility and reality)</a></strong>&nbsp;and <strong><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/search/searchresults.aspx?q=%22U%2Bfffd%22&amp;sections=3381">other U+fffd blogs in this Blog</a></strong>.But that's neither here nor there, today.</p>
<p>I just wanted to point out that now, all these years later, the work is done. We have bombed the PUA village and we've strafed the unpaired surrogate survivors.</p>
<p>Even when (as pointed out in <strong><a title="Short-sighted text processing #5: PU[A]! That pad THAI is pretty spicy...." href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2011/01/05/10111348.html">Short-sighted text processing #5: PU[A]! That pad THAI is pretty spicy....</a></strong>) we find we have told tell backward compatibility to <strong>Get Bent</strong>.</p>
<p>The PUA is gone from our hearts and our minds and our memories -- never to darken our doorstep again.</p>
<p>Um, except the place we forgot.</p>
<p>The Microsoft implementation of <strong>The Thai Pattachote keyboard layout</strong>.</p>
<p><em>You can see it right <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/bb964651.aspx">here</a>. Or otherwise h</em>ere it is, hidden in plain sight right atop the Enter key for over a decade:</p>
<p><img src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/3666.Pattachote01.jpg" /></p>
<p>This is just Microsoft, mind you.</p>
<p>The various other places where you can see the Thai Pattachote keyboard layout, like <a href="http://help.keymanweb.com/keyboards/keyboard_thai_pattachote.php">here</a> and pretty much most other places, if you ignore a few places like <a href="http://www.branah.com/thaipattachote">here</a>, which seem to be following us to insert a U+f8c7 on that key.</p>
<p>Note that is not one of the PUA characters on the list that once gave us Thai as we wanted it that I mentioned in <strong><a title="Short-sighted text processing #5: PU[A]! That pad THAI is pretty spicy...." href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2011/01/05/10111348.html">Short-sighted text processing #5: PU[A]! That pad THAI is pretty spicy....</a></strong>.This is just a random piece of the PUA whose continued presence is mostly due to this error of ours dating back to at least Windows NT 4.0, if not earlier.</p>
<p>We even have it mapped in <a href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/VENDORS/MICSFT/WindowsBestFit/bestfit874.txt">Code Page 874</a>, albeit underhandedly.</p>
<p>Oops, we have it there in the code page, too!</p>
<p>Now we have an interesting decision to make, one that will test the universal prohibition that has existed about never removing anything from a keyboard layout once it has shipped.</p>
<p>Do we remove U+f8c7 from the Thai Pattachote keyboard layout in future versions?</p>
<p>In this true case of an irresistible force versus an immovable object, it will be interesting to see what we do....</p>
<p><em>The advantage here is that no matter what, we are being consistent with&nbsp; previously established behavior, but the disadvantages is that no matter what, we are betraying as previously established pattern of behavior....</em></p>

<p>Lar Gand&#39;s words? &quot;That would be an example of an irresistable force striking an immovable object.&quot;</p>
<p>I guess even superheroes worlds have to find ways to try to work in the physical universe. :-)</p></div>
<p><strong>Quite so</strong> on 28 Jun 2011 8:35 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>The word is &quot;incompossible&quot;, meaning &quot;cannot exist in the same universe at the same time.&quot; &nbsp;This has awesome possibilities: &nbsp;consider &quot;Sir, we are incompossible&quot; as a challenge to a duel....</p>

<p>It was a bug reported to me by twitter friend Rifat Nabi (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/rifat">@rifat</a>) with a simple caption fom the tweet of "Microsoft Microsoft Word Bug":</p>
<p><img src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/5102.quotes01.jpg" border="1" /></p>
<p>and by twitter friend Tanbin Islam Siyam (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/potasiyam">@potasiyam</a>)&nbsp;in a picture with a bit more detail for those who didn't see what the problem was in the first picture:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/8738.quotes02.jpg" /></p>
<p>And some text explaining it, too (and pointing to another instance):</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">Another bug of MS Office.</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">An user of avro keyboard posted this bug in omicronlab forum (<a href="http://omicronlab.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=2436&amp;hl">http://omicronlab.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=2436&amp;hl</a>).</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">Quotation marks don't change after Dari (দাড়ি - । ), as it should be corrected to right quotation marks. But while typing in English it works.</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">I also tried typing in hindi with on-screen keyboard. Same result as Bangla.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">(Windows xp sp3+Office 2010)</span></p>
<p>The options in Word we are talking about is the one in this form:</p>
<p><img src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/6014.quotes03.jpg" /></p>
<p>and are documented as:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">* <strong>"Straight quotes" with &ldquo;smart quotes&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Replaces straight quotation marks ( " " ) and straight apostrophes ( ' ) with curved, open- and closed-quotation marks ( ) and curved apostrophes ( ).</p>
<p>which really says so little about what the options are....</p>
<p>It is hiding a huge feature, the one described on the Wikipedia article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-English_usage_of_quotation_marks">Non-English usage of quotation marks</a>. </p>
<p>Of course the feature depends a bit on the "language info via keyboard settings" stuff that so many people don't care for (Word does not retroactively change quotes if you tage text with a language after the fact).</p>
<p>Now every developer has had to at one time or another write their own <strong>FInQuotes</strong> function, or debug a flawed or incomplete one.</p>
<p>And this bug is just a simple limitation in mighty Word's work to detect open quotes versus closed quotes -- like maybe it isn't smart enough to see some scripts as text within a language, even as the text was tagged with a language due to being input with a Bangla keyboard....</p>
<p>I have previously talked about this feature in blogs like&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/02/20/1724946.html" title="Dumb quotes... or maybe they are just smart-ass quotes">Dumb quotes... or maybe they are just smart-ass quotes</a></strong>. And that blog is cool because it provides the table with data that Word uses for this feature.</p>
<p>The version of the table I was given clearly doesn't have much for these languages (admittedly that was from 2007; Word 2010 may have a bigger list), but note that there may still be problems in trying to deal with characters unknown to the code Word uses to detect text in quotes....</p>
<p>To me, this is just another reason that I am often unhappy with some Office features (e.g. like I described in <strong><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/03/01/541309.html" title="Address formats are hard, let's go shopping!">Address formats are hard, let's go shopping!</a></strong>)&nbsp;that <strong>are</strong> scenario-based and that <strong>do</strong>&nbsp;delight some customers, but which are ultimately incomplete.</p>
<p>Someone forgot that language support is a scenario-based feature, too. And did the work to finish the feature....</p>

<p>Today's blog will start with a digression.</p>
<p>I got an <strong>HTC Arrive</strong> from Sprint to replace my troubled <strong><span>Palm <span>Pre</span></span></strong> (which was itself a replacement for a broken <strong>LG</strong>). On the whole the <strong>Arrive</strong> is okay, though there are four problems with it:</p>
<ul>
<li>The&nbsp;Sprint store tools&nbsp;that migrated contacts from the <strong><span>Palm <span>Pre</span></span></strong> to the <strong>HTC Arrive</strong> would not handle contacts that li<span>nked together multiple accounts, so that if I added a phone number to a <span>Facebook</span> contact since I knew the number (which is implemented under the covers of both phones as a second contact, linked) the contact was not migrated. Thus i constantly have to turn on the old </span><strong><span>Palm <span>Pre</span></span></strong> to grab phone numbers. <em><span>This is either the fault of the Sprint store person being a moron or the Palm tool being lame, so I cannot properly blame it on either the </span><strong>Arrive</strong> or Microsoft's WP7;</em> </li>
<li><span>The <span>Facebook</span> app on the </span><strong><span>Palm <span>Pre</span></span></strong><span>added <span>Facebook</span> calendar events to the phone's calendar, which is perfect for my "not OCD enough to add social events to Outlook myself but not unwilling for something else to do it without annoying me" mindset. Unfortunately the <span>Facebook</span> app on the </span><strong>HTC Arrive</strong> had no such feature. <em><span>I suppose this could be considered Microsoft's fault since it is their company name on the <span>Facebook</span> app, but I do not know how much was <span>Facebook</span> provided;</span></em> </li>
<li>One of my two favorite Twitter apps on the <strong><span>Palm <span>Pre </span></span></strong><span>(Tweed) had a nice feature that paid attention to what I had seen before and let me know when I had either direct message or @ replies; the Twitter-provided Twitter app has no such feature -- so I have go look myself if I want to see replies to me. Annoying. </span><em><span>Since it is not only <span>Twitter's</span> app but the fact that both <span>Spaz</span> and Tweed are not being ported are because Twitter told 3rd party clients to get bent, this cane be considered <span>Twitter's</span> fault.</span></em> </li>
</ul>
<p><span>This third problem is the one that is relevant to today's blog; everything else is, as I suggested at the very beginning of the blog, a digression.</span></p>
<p><span>It all started when I happened to notice an&nbsp;@ reply to me from @<span>DrPizza</span> (you may know him as </span><a href="http://arstechnica.com/author/peter-bright/">Peter Bright</a>)&nbsp;from over a month ago:</p>
<p><img src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/3480.200b_5F00_01.jpg" /></p>
<p><span>Then when I looked at those links, I saw there were several other @ replies from Peter from several days prior to that:</span></p>
<p><img src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/5734.200b_5F00_02.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/6747.200b_5F00_03.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p><span>Okay, so it looks like I basically blew off Peter Bright. I guess the @IE account did too (I couldn't find a response from them, at least).</span></p>
<p>Sorry about that Peter!</p>
<p>Anyway he also gave some more explicit instructions in case I wasn't sure how to to test the result easily:</p>
<p><img src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/4628.200b_5F00_04.jpg" /></p>
<p><span>Yep, that's easier than what I would have done (built a small HTML page to <span>repro</span> it).</span></p>
<p><span>Okay so if you look at the </span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-width_space">Zero-width space</a><span><span>&nbsp;Wikipedia</span> page:</span></p>
<p><img src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/6835.200b_5F00_05.jpg" /></p>
<p>and follow the steps:</p>
<p><img src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/4278.200b_5F00_06.jpg" /></p>
<p>you will see a result slightly stranger than what Peter was suggesting:</p>
<p><img src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/8765.200b_5F00_07.jpg" /></p>
<p>What the hell is it doing?</p>
<p>Let's sretch the page back out to see what happens:</p>
<p><img src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/1682.200b_5F00_08.jpg" /></p>
<p><span><span>Okay</span>, at least is consistent.</span></p>
<p>I guess it is somehow related to strange behavior with U+200b, aka ZERO WIDTH SPACE.</p>
<p>But it is not as simple as putting a full space in where a ZWSP was sitting -- the "space" is inserted between the character <strong>after</strong> the ZWSP and the character after that.</p>
<p>Internet Explorer lets you select just this space and if you paste it somewhere else you can verify it is a U+200b.</p>
<p><span>This doesn't happen in Notepad, or <span>WordPad</span>, or Word. Or in FireFox for that matter.</span></p>
<p>A pure IE issue, I guess.</p>
<p><span>And I could only <span>repro</span> it with <span>Consolas</span> (no other font I tried had the problem). And IE.</span></p>
<p>Your guess is as good as mine as to whose fault it is, though I'll ping my favorite folks from IE and MS Typography to see if they can explain what's going on here.</p>
<p><span>And from now on, now that I know I'm not being gently told when someone @ replies me without spamming me with additional text messages, I'll check periodically for responses.</span></p>
<p>You know, so I don't blow off people whose columns I enjoy reading next time.... </p>
<hr/><p><strong>Mike Dimmick</strong> on 13 Jun 2011 3:33 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>IE9 renders the zero-width spaces as spaces, but in the correct place - both in IE 9 standards mode and in IE 8 standards mode. The F12 Developer Tools window&#39;s HTML pane still renders correctly.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not particular to Consolas, the same problem happens with Courier New, Lucida Console and Lucida Sans Typewriter.</p>

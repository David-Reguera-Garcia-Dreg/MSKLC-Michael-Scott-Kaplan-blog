<p>Maybe I should explain the tite&nbsp;statement before it ends up having an effect on my upcoming review....</p>
<p>You see, the other day, Dan asked:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">Subject: What are the F4 80 80 80 bytes in a UTF-8 HTML email body for?</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">Hello;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">I&rsquo;m working on an issue involving UTF-8 encoding.&nbsp; The customer is seeing these bits coming back from an Exchange EAS call which contains utf-8 encoded content which contains: F4 80 80 80. This content is in the HTML of an email body which contains simplified Chinese and English characters.&nbsp;&nbsp; The customer is saying that these bits are not valid.&nbsp; Are these some sort of special marker in UTF-8 encoding?</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">Thank you, </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">Dan</span></p>
<p>I saw the message on my phone, but I was at a late lunch (it was 1:34pm on a Wednesday). I figured I could answer it when I got back to my office.</p>
<p>But there really was no need....</p>
<p>Because at 2:08pm, just 34 minutes later, colleague Laurentiu resonded:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">Hello Dan,</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">&lt;F4, 80, 80, 80&gt; is a well-formed UTF-8 sequence that represents the Unicode character U+100000 (five zeros), which is a Unicode supplementary private-use character.&nbsp; Unicode contains three private-use areas: U+E000&ndash;U+F8FF in Plane 0 (Basic Multilingual Plane), and two supplementary planes, Planes 15 and 16 (Supplementary Private Use Area-A and -B).&nbsp; U+100000 is the first character of Plane 16.</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">Although they can contain anything the user defines, supplementary private-use areas are typically used for CJK ideographs that are not encoded in Unicode.&nbsp; So it looks like somebody is using a PUA character, possibly a private CJK ideograph.</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">Regards,</span></em><br /><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">L.</span></em></p>
<p>And there it is -- knowing that there are other people who know the answers to many of the random globalization, localizability, world-readiness, and other issues to help out when many of these questions come up, and who are willing and able to respond is a huge help as more and more people are trying to do the right thing in their projects and products and support cases.</p>
<p>I still do answer many questions. But there are many others who help out as well.</p>
<p>And that is one of the coolest parts of my job -- the fact that so many others are around to help do it! :-)</p>
<p>There are still questions that no one else seems to know the answers to, so I still have some utility. But its nice to know that there are others around with knowledge and interest....</p>

<p><strong>Van</strong> on 6 Jun 2011 7:24 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>I wonder if by &quot;invalid&quot;, the customer means &quot;showing up as a little box (or four)&quot;?</p>

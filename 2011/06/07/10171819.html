<p>The message I received the other day via the Contact link was:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">Dear Mr. Michael S. Kaplan,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">We see Microsoft created Language Interface Packs for near extinct languages&nbsp;like Irish and locales for endangered langages&nbsp;like Sami. We would like Microsoft to consider creating a locale for Ainu, a language of the island of Hokkaidō. Most of us&nbsp;from Hokkaidō only can read and write Japanese due to policies that discriminated for many years, but we see that Meiryo, Meiryo UI, MS UI Gothic,&nbsp; ＭＳ ゴシック, ＭＳ Ｐゴシック, ＭＳ 明朝, and ＭＳ Ｐ明朝 fonts all support extended Katakana used for Ainu. Can Microsoft take the additional steps to support Ainu?</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">I am Ainu. Our language is dying, but this does not have to be.&nbsp;A new life in Windows can save us.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">Thank you for reading this communication and sorry for the poor English.</span></p>
<p>I'll admit I feel a little bit under-equipped to respond to this message - my knowledge of Ainu, and of the Ainu, is not terribly&nbsp;extensive.</p>
<p>Though&nbsp;for the record&nbsp;I have no complaints about the English in the request, I only wish my Japanese could be good enough to have understood a message written in it!</p>
<p>The information in blogs like <strong><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2010/10/30/10083402.html" title="Why one LIP and not another?">Why one LIP and not another?</a></strong>&nbsp;and <strong><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2010/11/25/10095782.html" title="One Uyghur walked into a Blog, and...">One Uyghur walked into a Blog, and...</a></strong>&nbsp;help explain many of the complex factors that are involved in the language and locale lists of Windows. </p>
<p>I will communicate the request on, but of course asking me is not what makes the decision happen.</p>
<p>In the case of Ainu, efforts of the Japanese government, the&nbsp;Microsoft subsidiary in Japan, and the MS Public Sector folks in country&nbsp;would likely be important (just as efforts of the&nbsp;analogous&nbsp;people in Canada&nbsp;were important for the&nbsp;Inuqtitut LIP and the Mohawk locale).</p>
<p>To be honest, I would hate to think of Microsoft, and Windows, being the only hope here. At best we can be a passive tool that can help an active effort to revitalize a language (on the whole it seems like proofing tools do more for that than anything Windows can do when it comes to supporting a language!).</p>
<p>The BCP-47 tag for Ainu in this case would likely be&nbsp;<strong>ain-JP</strong>, and a custom locale could be created for it quite easily. Collation may already work (Kana works in all locales -- and the <a href="http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U31F0.pdf">Katakana Phonetic Extensions</a>&nbsp;are covered with the rest of the Kana.&nbsp;A dedicated keyboard via MSKLC would also help (a full IME wouldn't be needed, just a better Katakana coverage). As the person asking noted, the characters are already in the fonts....</p>
<p>In fact, I would do it myself right here if I had a source from which to get the data like month and day names. I found many references to the work of Emiko Ohnuki-Tierney in regard to the concepts of time among the Ainu and they clearly have both months and days. But neither days nor months were named, and I&nbsp;had no luck finding this information elsewhere in quick web searches -- perhaps if anyone knows of any they could point the info out?</p>
<p>Languages in trouble are deinitely a matter of concern, always. But in cases like this we shouldn't even wait for a locale or a LIP that may or may not arrive -- there is work that can be done today....</p>

<p><strong>John Cowan</strong> on 7 Jun 2011 9:23 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Essentially all Ainu-speakers are native speakers of Japanese who have learned Ainu as a second language, so it seems reasonable to embed Japanese names in the locale when Ainu names are not available.</p>
<p>It&#39;s important that fonts support the combinations of katakana small fu, se, to, and to with the semi-voiced sound mark, as quality Ainu typography depends on these combinations.</p>
<p>Note that there are two orthographies, so some Latin script support is needed: Basic Latin plus the five vowels with either circumflex or macron (they mean the same thing).</p>

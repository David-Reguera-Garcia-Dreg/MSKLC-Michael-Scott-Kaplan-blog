<p>After Klingon was officially rejected from Unicode (as I hinted at previously in <strong><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/12/24/507177.html" title="Fictional could make things less functional">Fictional could make things less functional</a></strong>), we all thought we'd heard the last of it.</p>
<p>Well, not all all of us.</p>
<p>Just those of us with whom i find myself most comfortable hanging around. :-)</p>
<p>Then just yesterday Karl Williamson sent the following to The Unicode List:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">I just found out about the information contained in the article linked </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">to below.&nbsp; I wonder if people knew about this when it was decided to not </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">encode Klingon:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;"><a href="http://www.iol.co.za/news/back-page/klingon-interpreter-needed-for-social-work-1.106317">Klingon interpreter needed for social work</a></span></p>

<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">Portland, Oregon - Position Available: Interpreter, must be fluent in Klingon. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">The language created for the Star Trek television series and movies is one of about 55 needed by the office that treats mental health patients in metropolitan Multnomah County. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"We have to provide information in all the languages our clients speak," said Jerry Jelusich, a procurement specialist for the county's department of human services, which serves about 60 000 mental health clients. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">Although created for works of fiction, Klingon was designed to have a consistent grammar, syntax and vocabulary. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">And now Multnomah County research has found that many people - and not just fans - consider it a complete language. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">"There are some cases where we've had mental health patients where this was all they would speak," said the county's purchasing administrator, Franna Hathaway. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">Officials said that obligates them to respond with a Klingon-English interpreter, putting the language of starship Enterprise officer Worf and other Klingon characters on a par with common languages such as Russian and Vietnamese, and less common tongues including Dari and Tongan. - Sapa-AP </span></p>
<p><em>Note the date, of course!</em> </p>
<p>Luckily Peter Edberg jumped in quickly before it oscillated into one of those long threads:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">That article was probably based on a mistake. See about 2/3 of the way down in</span></em><br /><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;"><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/05/14/national/main553897.shtml">http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/05/14/national/main553897.shtml</a>:</span></em></p>

<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><span style="font-size: small;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">PORTLAND, Oregon - Sorry, no Klingon interpreters needed, after all. The government</span></em></span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">agency that treats mental health patients in the Portland, Oregon, area had listed</span></em></span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">Klingon as one of 55 languages that clients might speak. Now, Multnomah County</span></em></span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">officials are taking back their call for Klingon interpreters. County Chair Diane</span></em></span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">Linn says the inclusion of the "Star Trek" language on the list was a mistake.</span></em></span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">Officials note that no mental patient had ever come in speaking only Klingon. And</span></em></span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">not a dime of public money was spent on Klingon interpretation.</span></em></span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">---</span></em></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">Sorry.</span></em><br /><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">- Peter Edberg (Eugene, Oregon)</span></em></p>
<p>This nicely managed to stop the conversation before it started.</p>
<p>And oh what a conversation it would have been!</p>
<p>Thankfully, there are not enough psychiatric patients claiming to only be able to communicate in Klingon that an interpreter would be required.</p>
<p>And certainly not enough reading and writing in it, using the non-Latin script that not even the <a href="http://www.kli.org/">Klingon Language Institute</a>&nbsp;uses!</p>
<p>I suppose one day I should more fully cover the rejection directly.</p>
<p>And I shall.</p>
<p>Another day....</p>

<p>People seeking mental health services in Portland have nothing on some of the people Unicode has to deal with.</p>

<p><strong>Van</strong> on 6 Jun 2011 1:25 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>We all know that prior to Unicode, the only written messages that could be sent were ASCII art.</p>

<p><strong>Doug Ewell</strong> on 6 Jun 2011 9:06 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>At least Klingon letters are characters. Most of the things William wants to encode aren&#39;t even characters.</p>

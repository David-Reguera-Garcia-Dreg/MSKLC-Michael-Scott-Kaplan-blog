<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>No, this blog is not a political statement about policies of Kim Jong-il or the DPRK or the next ruler. It is technical blog about a keyboard....</em></span></p>
<p>It started not long after&nbsp;the <strong><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/08/27/8898859.html" title="Keyboard Layouts, everywhere!">Keyboard Layouts, everywhere!</a></strong>&nbsp;blog I wrote.</p>
<p>The one&nbsp;that pointed out the revamped site showing all the Windows keyboard layouts, which in&nbsp;this new&nbsp;incarnation would support not only Internet Explorer, but now also FireFox, Opera, Safari, and Chrome.</p>
<p>You can call it</p>
<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/goglobal/bb964651">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/goglobal/bb964651</a></p>
<p>Or you can call it</p>
<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/bb964651.aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/bb964651.aspx</a></p>
<p>Or you can even call it</p>
<p><a href="http://msdn.com/bb964651.aspx">http://msdn.com/bb964651.aspx</a></p>
<p>They all resolve to that same site.</p>
<p>Shortly after that blog, in <strong><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/09/05/8925618.html" title="The key KEY perspective is that 'Perspective is Key'">The key KEY perspective is that 'Perspective is Key'</a></strong>, I discussed an issue in the Japanese and Korean layouts on that site that is an intentional choice, but one that some might consider to be unintuitive or even a bug.</p>
<p>In the process of that, a bigger issue which one could much more&nbsp;defensibly consider a bug was being ignored.</p>
<p>It can be found in the Korean keyboard layout. Not in the base state of either the ENG or KOR modes:</p>
<p><img src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/5621.korshift03.JPG" />&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/4466.korshift01.JPG" /></p>
<p>both of which rermain bug free. Instead if you look at the SHIFT mode on both you'll see some problems:</p>
<p><img src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/6114.korshift04.JPG" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/6661.korshift02.JPG" /></p>
<p>Now there are two problems here.</p>
<p>Did you spot them both?</p>
<p>They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The parentheses are backwards in both modes, and</li>
<li>The KOR mode has a bunch of blank keys on it, while the actual keyboard types the same characters that exist in the BASE state.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can look at this picture for a more obvious&nbsp;highlighting of the problems (the first problem in red, the second in green):</p>
<p><img src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/6646.korshift08.jpg" /></p>
<p>Luckily the&nbsp;soft keyboard built into the IME does it all correctly, though:</p>
<p><img src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/3404.korshift07.jpg" /></p>
<p>Now I guess the idea of only showing the "doubled' Jamo (I talked about the doubled Jamo previously in <strong><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/02/20/1722221.html" title="Ssang Your Life (or alternately: I'd Like To Teach the World To Ssang)">Ssang Your Life (or alternately: I'd Like To Teach the World To Ssang)</a></strong>) was intended as a way to emphasize them via contrast, but honestly it would probably be better to be accurate here....</p>
<p>As for the reversed parentheses, that's simply a straight bug without even a weak justification....</p>
<p>It looks a little like something else that isn't as much of a bug though it is a little bit of one that I'll talk about another day; but THIS is definitely just a bug.</p>
<p>These bugs should definitely be looked into, though -- being&nbsp;correct is so much better for everyone!</p>
<hr/><p><strong>Mihai</strong> on 8 Jun 2011 4:58 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>That web page (with keyboard layouts) used to be handy, sometimes.</p>
<p>But now it is so outdated that I am not sure about usefulness.</p>
<p>For instance there is only Romanian instance (while there are 3 of the them now: Standard, Legacy, and Programmers).</p>
<p>And that instance is ugly (3, if not 4 different fonts) and wrong (showing the cedilla forms for s and t (U+015F and U+0163)). Unless that is the &quot;Legacy&quot; layout, in which case is not wrong, just outdated :-)</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 8 Jun 2011 8:02 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Well it is behind by a few keyboards....probably 100 or so (like 40 new ones since XP SP 2 and the rest small additions). I guess that might be something to fix here, huh? :-)</p>

<p>It should not matter if it is 100 or 1000, I can imagine a solution to deal with that, and working forever (more or less).</p>
<p>One can write a .NET application to generate the keyboard layouts based on the current system. Might need some native calls, and big chunks might be reused from MSKLC.</p>
<p>Then make sure that the server has all the keyboards installed (which it does, I assume nobody deletes the keyboard layout files :-) and you are always up to date.</p>
<p>Alternatively, have the app written in &quot;no matter what language&quot; and generate data files and images to be consumed by the current site.</p>
<p>Probably something that can really use MSKLC as is (with some automation and screen captures).</p>
<p>Probably even less work to implement, does not have the quality requirements of something running on a public server, and easier to get the latest keyboards.</p>
<p>But one would have to run it once in a while and push out new data files.</p>
<p>Work? Yes, but smarter than editing files in Photoshop and editing keyboards</p>
<p>(I see no other explanation for the 4 different fonts in the Romanian keyboard :-)</p>

<p>Rich's question was straightforward enough:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">Hello,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">The product I work on needs to run on .Net 2 but our test harness needs to run on .Net 4.&nbsp; These are hard restrictions and we can&rsquo;t get around them due to dependencies.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">When I run the following code on .Net 2.0 and .Net 4.0, I get different outputs.</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">DateTime now = DateTime.Now;</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">CultureInfo ci = new CultureInfo("it-IT", false);</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">Console.Write(now.ToString("T", ci));</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">The operating systems seem to have different values as well, though the .Net behavior will be the same on either OS.&nbsp;&nbsp; Does anyone know what is correct time format is and where this is defined?</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">Server 2008 SP2:<br /></span><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;"><img src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/0652.italy01.jpg" width="348" height="400" /></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">Server 2008 R2 SP1:<br /><img src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/6180.italy02.jpg" width="351" height="405" /></span></p>
<p>I suppose this question just helps to prove that the question&nbsp;being straightforward isn't much of an indicator for whether the answer will be.</p>
<p>Where should we start?</p>
<ul>
<li>There is absolutely no guarantee whatsoever that data will not change&nbsp;between versions of Windows;</li>
<li>There is absolutely no guarantee whatsoever that data will not be different between Windows and .Net;</li>
<li>Cultures like it-IT were not changed at all in .Net 2.0/3.0/3.5, but were all updated in .Net 4.0 based on changes that had been happening;</li>
<li>The notion of adding a dependency between multiple versions returning the same results is dangerous at best and can often be counted on to fail.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, the only surprising fact is that the scenario ever "worked" -- failure can eventually be pretty much guaranteed....</p>

<h1>Tweels (n) - The squeals tween tweeps make when they tweet</h1>

<p>The title of this blog certainly suggests one theoretical etymology for the word <strong>Tweel</strong>, though it is, by being largely a product of my own random thoughts without any supporting research, unlikely to be true.</p>
<p><strong>Tweels</strong> do have a source, though, Michelin!</p>
<p>You can read about them on Wikipedia, here:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">The Tweel (a portmanteau of tire and wheel) is an experimental tire design developed by the French tire company Michelin. The tire uses no air, and therefore cannot burst or become flat. Instead, the Tweel's hub connects to flexible polyurethane spokes which are used to support an outer rim and assume the shock-absorbing role of a traditional tire's pneumatic properties.</p>
<p>They even have some public domain art:</p>
<p><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/Tweel.JPG"><img border="0" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/Tweel.JPG" width="250" height="175" /></a></p>
<p>I had a colleague at work ask me if I was going to get <strong>tweels</strong> put on my iBot, especially given that the iBot was originally introduced with tweels as its wheels.</p>
<p>He even pointed me to a video from Michelin from a few years back that mentions the iBot and shows one riding on Tweels:</p>
<p><embed height="349" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/ECUhBoDnrKI?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="false" /></p>
<p>This is, I will admit, pretty cool.</p>
<p>After his inquiry, I did ask one of the few remaining folks manning the technical support desk for my iBot at Independence Technology and after looking into a bit he said that although they were initially used, there were complaints about noise from the tire and also heat that it would generate -- both present even at the lower speeds of an iBot relative to a car.</p>
<p>It is unknown if Michelin is still working on this project, but even if they were it is unlikely they would&nbsp; have anything before January 2013 when Independence Technology shuts down, and even if they did it is highly unlikely Independence Technology would offer a new option for tire replacement from the one they have now.</p>
<p>Those who would dare to dream of a tweet&nbsp;about me, the non-tween riding on&nbsp;two Tweels, will likely have to keep dreaming. I do have plans to make some changed to the iBot after the warranty expires (I'll write about those more fully after said expiration), buying tweels from Michelin is not currently one of those changes....</p>

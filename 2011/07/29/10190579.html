<h1>The reach of Apple? Or of the Klingon Empire? Neither was behind this one...</h1>

<p>So over in the Suggestion Box, Steve commented:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">For fun purposes: The "Apple logo" PUA Codepoint 0xF8FF mentioned in&nbsp;<a href="http://unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/VENDORS/APPLE/SYMBOL.TXT">http://unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/VENDORS/APPLE/SYMBOL.TXT</a> maps to a Klingon empire "Glyph" in the Code2000 font ;-))</span></em></p>
<p>Well, thus wasn't really a secret Easter Egg for Apple....</p>
<p>Is it perhaps more of a way of helping Michael Everson's ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2/WG2 N1643 (<a href="http://std.dkuug.dk/JTC1/SC2/WG2/docs/n1643/n1643.htm">Proposal to encode Klingon in Plane 1 of ISO/IEC 10646-2</a>) come alive despite the eventual rejection of the script in Unicode?</p>
<p>You can see all of the characters ufrom the proposal if you look at the font in Character Map:</p>

<p>You can see lots of other stuff too, if you'll see. Seem familiar, any of it?</p>
<p>The encoding here is not a Klingon Easter Egg of some sort; it and the other characters here are all from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ConScript_Unicode_Registry">Conscript unicode Registry</a>....</p>
<p>I guess there are some places even Apple and the Klingon Empire can't reach.</p>
<p>But let's not take any chances.</p>

<p><strong>ErikF</strong> on 1 Aug 2011 8:10 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Wasn&#39;t this the point of the PUA? I doubt that any of the ConScript stuff will ever make it into Unicode (although Deseret was adopted eventually.) The only issue that I can see is that according to <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/05/21/2782610.html">blogs.msdn.com/.../2782610.aspx</a> my epic Klingon novel will be treated as being in an Asian language in Word!</p>
<p>(Actually, there is another issue that you raised in <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/09/26/473738.html">blogs.msdn.com/.../473738.aspx</a> , that being the inability of the rendering engine to determine the classes of the characters, etc. Can font designers work around that yet? That&#39;s the biggest hindrance that I can see in using PUA characters, because the characters won&#39;t look as &quot;nice&quot; as characters in defined blocks.)</p>

<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 1 Aug 2011 8:19 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>For the other issue, a combination of Unicode conformance and lack of serious interest keeps the companies in line, out of the ConScriot business.</p>

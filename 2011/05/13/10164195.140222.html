<p>Yesterday when I blogged <strong><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2011/05/12/10163685.html" title="It will take putting NADS out in front to make a diference">It will take putting NADS out in front to make a difference</a></strong>, there were some unexpected consequences.</p>
 <p>I happened to post a link to the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd317791.aspx">Digit Shapes</a>&nbsp;MSDN topic, and I got back an earful about issues with the topic.</p>
 <p>Like the fact that it perhaps plays fast and loose with terminology.</p>
 <p>Perhaps blaming an MSDN help topic for&nbsp;the problems here is a bit much though -- since the problems pre-date MSDN, Microsoft, computers, and even calculators by quite a piece!</p>
 <p>When we look at the "ASCII digits" <strong>0123456789</strong>&nbsp;we are talking about a digit system that arose in India sometime between 500 B.C.E. and 500 C.E. It went from there to various Arabic mathematicians. Because of that they are usually referred to as <strong>Arabic</strong> or&nbsp;sometimes even W<strong>estern Arabic</strong> or even&nbsp;<strong>Arabic-Indic</strong> or digits.</p>
 <p>There is a choice bit of irony in ever thinking of these as <strong>Arabic-Indic</strong> digits (as some people do, based on where they came from), since meanwhile the folks who spoke Arabic and who were mathematicians were usually using the <strong>Eastern Arabic</strong> digits <span style="font-size: large;">٠١٢٣٤٥٦٧٨٩</span>, often thought of as <strong>Hindi</strong> digits or <strong>Indian</strong> digits, though within Unicode known by their names as the <strong>Arabic-Indic</strong> digits.</p>
 <p>Confused yet? :-)</p>
 <p>Meanwhile through India there were other digit systems used that were none of these ones like the <strong>Devanagari</strong> digits <span style="font-size: large;">०१२३४५६७८९</span>, where you can see some of the shapes of the European digits likely came from.</p>
 <p>So in the Western world&nbsp;we use <strong>Arabic</strong> digits while in the Arab world they use <strong>Hindi</strong>digits while in India (arguably the birthplace of Hinduism) they use the <strong>Devanagari</strong> and other digits. </p>
 <p>The names of many of these various digits&nbsp;obviously tend to be based on their source rather than where they sit now, while the source location kind of moved on elsewhere with their own numbers -- making the names feel almost like anachronisms, of a sort. Well, maybe not anachronisms in the conventional sense but certainly items [mis]named in a way that is akin to an anachronism (a chronological inconsistency) -- maybe a geographical inconsistency?</p>
 <p>Probably it would be easier to simply include the digits the way I do above while putting the various names in quotes so as not to claim any one of them is right since they are all riddled with inconsistencies anyway.</p>
 <p>Now there were other issues pointed out of a more technical nature than technicalities with the names of the digits, but I'll get into those problems another day....</p>

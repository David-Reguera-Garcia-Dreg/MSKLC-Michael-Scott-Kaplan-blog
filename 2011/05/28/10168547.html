<h1>MUI and MFC live together in perfect harmony...</h1>

<p>I'm not really in touch with my old group the way I used to be.</p>
<p>Even though I still work with them from time to time&nbsp;and find myself in meetings with them occasionally, the connection just doesn't occur to people to use.</p>
<p>I mean for example, it was about 3.5 years ago, in blogs like</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/11/27/6540276.html" title="﻿There is no E in MUI, even if you pronounce it MOO-EE">﻿There is no E in MUI, even if you pronounce it MOO-EE</a></strong>, and</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/12/10/6715776.html" title="MUI is like your heartbeat; it's important and useful, whether you know about it or not">MUI is like your heartbeat; it's important and useful, whether you know about it or not</a></strong>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>where Erik Fortune (and I suppose I) promised a sample of how to integrate MUI with MFC, as an example of how to use MFC within another resource technology framework.</p>
<p>It is one of the only "guest post" blogs I have ever published, although once when someone in a group I used to be in accused me of using the Blog to gain extra visibility I offered anyone the ability to do a guest blog if they wanted. No one took me up on the offer.</p>
<p>I'm digressing again....</p>
<p>Anyway, back to those blogs from 3.5 years ago, the ones with the promise.</p>
<p>I kind of lost track of the whole thing, to be honest.</p>
<p>But it turns out they did put the sample up eventually, they just didn't tell me about it....</p>
<p>You can find it right here: <a href="http://archive.msdn.microsoft.com/MUIFallbackMFC">Implementing MUI fallback with MFC</a></p>
<p>Sorry I didn't point to it sooner, I didn't know! We just aren't in contact like we used to be.</p>
<p>Now these are the kind of samples that can make MUI easier to approach by the&nbsp;many people who already have solutions of some type in place. In fact if I have any objection is that they didn't push harder to build it into MFC directly, but that's a much bigger resource issue, obviously....</p>
<p>Anyway, enjoy!</p>

<p>Kind of disappointed to see nothing.</p>
<p>But hey, it is what is is :-)</p>
<p>My take: it is great to have that code out. But making the extra effort to put it in MFC would probably be the best thing ever for MUI.</p>
<p>It is a bit like Unicode: there were tons of articles and code samples showing how to write Unicode applications for Windows.</p>
<p>And guess what: not much traction.</p>
<p>Until the Visual Studio new application wizard started creating Unicode applications by default, not much changed.</p>
<p>Just imagine being able to just drop a new file in the right place and have it work, without even thinking about it. Like on Mac OS ;-)</p>

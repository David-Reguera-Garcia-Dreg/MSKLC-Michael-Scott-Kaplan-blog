<p>Relatively common practices can often be dead wrong.</p>
<p>Take the following code snippet for example (names munged to protect the guilty):</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: Consolas,Lucida Console,Courier,Courier New,Fixed;"><b>BOOL CSillyBackwardsCollection::IsValidAlias(__in LPCWSTR pszAlias)<br />{<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while ((*pszAlias != chNullTerminator) &amp;&amp; (MAX_NAME_LENGTH &gt; index))<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if ( !iswalnum(*pszAlias) &amp;&amp; (*pszAlias != L'_') &amp;&amp; (*pszAlias != L'-') )<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // not&nbsp;a valid identifier<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return FALSE;</b></span></p>
<p>Okay, now it is&nbsp;obvious that there are few cases where every single code point in Unicode shouldn be treated as valid for a name, identifier, or alias.</p>
<p>And it is great that that this code is using Unicode - it has been a long time coming and it is good to see more and more people doing this, by default and automatically.</p>
<p>But iswalnum?</p>
<p><strong>iswalnum</strong>?</p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large;"><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/k84c0490.aspx">iswalnum</a>?</span></p>
<p>Geez.</p>
<p>This Microsoft CRT function is not (in any version whatsoever) following the latest best practices that Unicode suggests in either <a href="http://unicode.org/reports/tr18/">Unicode Technical Standard #18: Unicode Regular Expressions</a>&nbsp;or <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr31/">Unicode Standard Annex #31: Unicode Identifier and Pattern Syntax</a>, which means that there are all kinds of perfectly valid Unicode characters that are needed for many of the languges and scripts covered by Unicode that this code will discard.</p>
<p>See the title of this blog? There are languages and scripts that will be impacted the same way in their letters. Don't forget the lessons of blogs like <strong><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/09/12/463991.html" title="Is Kana 'alphabetic' ? Depends on who you ask....">Is Kana 'alphabetic' ? Depends on who you ask....</a></strong>; there are languages that are completely taken out of the running here!</p>
<p>Now a part of me wants to blame this code snippet.</p>
<p>But just a small part.</p>
<p>Because a much bigger part of me sees that the biggest problem is the need to overhaul the all of the Microsoft Visual C Runtime <strong>CTYPE</strong> (character type) functions to be line with both <a href="http://unicode.org/reports/tr18/">UTS #18</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr31/">UAX #31</a>. </p>
<p>For example, see <a href="http://unicode.org/reports/tr18/#Compatibility_Properties">this</a>&nbsp;table for a much better way to classify Unicode characters. The distance betwen this and what the CRT uses is <strong>huge</strong>!</p>
<p>The CRT needs to grow up and embrace Unicode in all&nbsp;of its uses rather than just using the schemes cobbled together for POSIX compatibility back before Unicode was anywhere significant....</p>
<p><em>Note to&nbsp;folks who own the CRT -- my schedule is up to date if you want to discuss the needs of <a href="http://unicode.org/reports/tr18/">UTS #18</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr31/">UAX #31</a>&nbsp;further! :-)</em></p>

But we still have user stories being pushed on us that include in the acceptance criteria that only &quot;valid&quot; usernames / email addresses / etc. are accepted.</p>
<p>It just doesn&#39;t seem possible to *know* (as a native English speaker) what unicode codepoints outside of the Latin1 set might not - or should not - be valid in usernames or other short strings that we normally don&#39;t expect whitespace, punctuation, or control codes in.</p>

<p>However if you can ignore non-internet email addresses, do what I do:</p>
<p>* there is exactly one at sign</p>
<p>* there are not two consecutive dots on the right side of the at sign</p>

<p>If their mail client can&#39;t send/receive the mail then it probably isn&#39;t their email address anyway. :-)</p>

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Based on a <span><span>Facebook</span></span> insight in the middle of commenting on one of <span><span>Hande's</span></span> statuses from yesterday morning -- an insight I had once before but that prior use was for utility explaining it with a relationship rather than entertainment like it was yesterday and maybe is today....</em></span></p>
<p>It starts with the shapes, the curves. I believe it was Andy "<span><span>Slipstick</span></span>" Libby who first suggested the shapes where one could find elegant fifth order functions - he was including the time variable. So we (the boys, I mean) watch those shapes. We want something here, we just <span><span>hve</span></span> no idea what it is <span>exactly</span>.</p>
<p>In oather words, it is about GEOMETRY.</p>
<p>Then, it really is just a numbers game. I mean, sometimes&nbsp;one has to be turned down by Tammy and Stephanie and Melissa before one gets to meet Arlene and then re-aquaint yourself with Tammy, later on in the numbers game when things&nbsp;start to add up.</p>
<p><span>In&nbsp;other words, it is about the MATH.</span></p>
<p>Along the way one sometimes finds that things really click, that there is a real connection that takes hold and refuses to let go. It's excitement, it's attraction.</p>
<p>In other words, it is about&nbsp;CHEMISTRY.</p>
<p>The next step leads to learning more about&nbsp;each other, about beliefs and history and values. Because if you find you have <span>enough</span> in common then sooner or later it is going to get more private intimate.</p>
<p>In other words, it is about PHYSICS.</p>
<p>{perhaps at this point an importance of "hard" sciences pun -- thanks Dave! -- would be appropriate while of course being simultaneously <span>inappropriate</span>}</p>
<p><span>Next if one wants to be with someone forever (imagine Erin Grey as Wilma <span>Deering</span> asking "Oh Buck Rogers, does that mean we'll be together for always?"), there will be marriage and sometimes there will even be perpetuation of the species -- also known as children.</span></p>
<p>In other words, it is about BIOLOGY.</p>
<p>So if you ever were wondering why people put so much emphasis on the hard sciences and their importance, now you know -- IT'S ALL ABOUT SCIENCE! </p>

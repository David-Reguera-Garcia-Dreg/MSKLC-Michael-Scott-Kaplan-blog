<p><strong>A LITTLE BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON THE NIGERIAN LANGUAGES</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>NUMBER OF SPEAKERS</strong>: </p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Hausa:&nbsp;24 million native speakers, 15 million second- language<br />Igbo:&nbsp;18 million<br />Yoruba:&nbsp;20 million, 2 million second-language</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">PREDOMINANT DISTRIBUTION IN NIGERIA: </p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><img height="365" width="409" src="http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-filesystemfile.ashx/__key/CommunityServer-Blogs-Components-WeblogFiles/00-00-00-33-81/0523.LinguisticGroups.jpg" border="0" /></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>SOME FUN FACTS</strong>: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">Non-native pronunciation of Hausa differs vastly from native pronunciation by way of key omissions of implosive and ejective consonants present in native Hausa dialects. This creates confusion among non-native and native Hausa speakers, because non-native Hausa speakers do not differentiate between the pronunciation of words like daidai (correct) and ɗaiɗai (one-by-one) in non-native Hausa.&nbsp;</div>
</li>
<li>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">Many names in Igbo are actually fusions of older original words and phrases. For example, one Igbo word for vegetable leaves is akw&uuml;kw&ouml; nri, which literally means "leaves for eating" or "vegetables". Green leaves are called akw&uuml;kw&ouml; ndu, because ndu means "life". </div>
</li>
<li>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">In Yoruba there are no differences for the singular and plural. The context decides whether a word denotes singular or plural. </div>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>CLASSIFICATION</strong>: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">Hausa is the most widely spoken of the Chadic languages under which Hausa is classified in the West Chadic subgroup.&nbsp; The Chadic languages are part of the Afro-Asiatic language family.&nbsp;</div>
</li>
<li>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">Igbo and Yoruba are members of the Benue-Congo subfamily of the Niger-Congro language family. The Benue-Congo subfamily includes the widely spoken Bantu languages of Eastern and Southern Africa.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">See classification information for: <a href="http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=hau">Hausa</a>&nbsp; <a href="http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=ibo">Igbo</a>&nbsp; <a href="http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=yor">Yoruba</a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>SCRIPT</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">Hausa is written with a modified Latin script called Bok&ograve;. Three consonants were added to the basic Latin alphabet; a fourth consonant&nbsp; is used in Niger. The Bok&ograve; alphabet was introduced by the British at the beginning of the 20th century and replaced the modified Arabic script that had been used before. This script, called &Agrave;jami, is still occasionally used, especially in religious writing and for poetry.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">Igbo is written in the Latin script, the official orthography is known as Onwu. The Igbo people first used Nsibidi ideograms invented by the neighboring Ekoi people for writing.&nbsp;</div>
</li>
<li>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">Yoruba uses the Latin alphabet, modified by the use of the digraph gb and the letters ẹ, ọ and ș.&nbsp; Three diacritics are used on vowels and syllabic nasal consonants to indicate the tones used in Yoruba: an acute accent (&acute;) for the high tone, a grave accent (`) for the low tone, and an optional macron (&macr;) for the middle tone (which is more often left unmarked).</div>

(or is Ibo the language and Igbo the script, as I might deduce from which links use which?)</p>

<p><strong>Kathleen</strong> on 2 Feb 2011 11:46 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Find it interesting title &quot;for Nigeria&quot; yet language packs for other multi-lingual countries/regions, ie India, &nbsp;keep trickling out independently. Was this a Nigerian government requirement?</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Oluseyi</strong> on 2 Feb 2011 1:23 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>@Jeremy: The Igbo/Ibo thing is a transliteration challenge, due to an imprecise mapping of a consonant that doesn&#39;t exist in English or any other language that uses the Latin alphabet (gb). Simplified spellings use &quot;Ibo,&quot; whereas older spellings that attempt to capture the linguistic nuance use &quot;Igbo.&quot; Both are acceptable.</p>
<p>@Kathleen: Quite possibly. Many things in Nigeria are carefully calibrated to maintain the illusion of parity, so as not to stoke any latent hostilities. For instance, the official statistics on religion state 49% of the population is Christian, 49% is Muslim, and the remaining 2% adhere to various &quot;traditional religions.&quot; It&#39;s a transparently false statistic, in part because many people both profess one of the Abrahamic religions and adhere to traditional rites and rituals (often having family idols in a shrine in the home, for example), and because the visible population disparity should give a clear numerical/proportional advantage to Christianity.</p>
<p>All that said, this is nice to see. Wish I had a Windows 7 box around to play with the Yoruba LIP. Good job!</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 2 Feb 2011 1:37 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>@Kathleen: My understanding of the situation is that there was no requirement from the government but a general request for things to be in sync, so that accidental fortune (e.g. who finishes first) is not mistaken as malicious intent (e.g. &quot;language AAAA is more important than language BBBB&quot;).</p>
<p>Microsoft faces similar pressures with the LIPs of Spain, though we do not do as good of a job with the pressure there. :-)</p></div>
<p><strong>John Cowan</strong> on 3 Feb 2011 9:13 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>&quot;Igbo&quot; is the way it&#39;s spelled in Igbo, but Igbos would rather have anglophones see &quot;Ibo&quot; and pronounce it &quot;Eeebo&quot; than see &quot;Igbo&quot; and pronounce it &quot;Igg-bo&quot;, which is just Igg-norant. &nbsp;Many Igbo speakers use an implosive &quot;b&quot; (IPA [ɓ])anyway rather than the double-articulated consonant.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 3 Feb 2011 9:32 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Not unlike the way Greeks feel about the way we pronounce Gyro! :-)</p>

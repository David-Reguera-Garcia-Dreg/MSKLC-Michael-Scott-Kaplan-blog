<p>It's an old joke, but perhaps a few if you haven't heard it before....</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">An English professor wrote the words:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><span style="font-size: large;">A woman without her man is nothing.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">on the chalkboard and asked his students to punctuate it correctly.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">All of the males in the class wrote:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><span style="font-size: large;">A woman, without her man, is nothing.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">All of the females in the class wrote:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><span style="font-size: large;">A woman: without her, man is nothing.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">One thing is perfectly clear, though:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><span style="font-size: x-large;">Punctuation is powerful.</span></p>
<p>Perhaps it is a bit hasty to pass that NORM_IGNORESYMBOLS flag?</p>
<p>Though on the other hand if I pass NORM_IGNORESYMBOLS | NORM_IGNORECASE&nbsp;it has the benefit of allowing me to tell all of the kids in the class that they are wrong, and flunking them.</p>
<p>Just don't forget that the space is also a symbol.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: xx-large;">awomanwithouthermanisnothing</span></p>
<p>Welcome to Thailand, everyone! We didn't need the spaces anyway....</p>
<p>You get my point. Everyone is always so quick to ignore stuff that may be interesting or important. We could all do with a little bit less of that.</p>
<p>It's one of the reasons the support for collation in Windows is so unsuited for search - because its only choices are to only see with the distinctions or to ignore all of them so completely that a user is almost punished for when they are specifically looking for the distinctions. When what search really needs is both -- to be willing to ignore distinctions of all sorts but to never forget they are there, and to prefer them when you see them....</p>

<p><strong>Brendan Elliott</strong> on 20 Feb 2011 1:44 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>If you do search based on word breaking, then the word breakers tend to remove the punctuation long before you could even think about using NORM_IGNORESYMBOLS... &nbsp;Agreed that the distinctions could be useful for ranking results, although there would likely be some impact on query time and/or index size.</p>

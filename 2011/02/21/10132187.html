<p>So you may have noticed that back in October that I blogged <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2010/10/12/10074534.html" title="Unicode 6.0.0 is [virtually] released!"><strong>Unicode 6.0.0 is [virtually] released!</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Hopefully no one was holding their breath waiting for everything to get finished&nbsp;and written up. Because at the end last week, the full release happened. :-)</p>
<p>From the release notification:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><em>Mountain View, CA, February 17, 2011 - The Unicode&reg; Consortium is pleased to announce the publication of the final text of the core specification for Unicode 6.0. The Unicode 6.0 core specification includes information on scripts newly encoded in Unicode 6.0, as well as many updates and clarifications to other sections of the text. The release of the core specification completes the definitive documentation of the Unicode Standard, Version 6.0</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><em>In Version 6.0, the standard grew by 2,088 characters. Over 1,000 of these characters are symbols used for text exchange on mobile phones. The Unicode Standard now also includes the recently created official symbol for the Indian rupee. After computers and mobile phones update to Version 6.0, the rupee sign will be available for use like the $ or &euro; now.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><em>In addition, this version adds many CJK Unified Ideographs in common use in China, Taiwan, and Japan,as well as characters for African language support, including extensions to the Tifinagh, Ethiopic,and Bamum scripts. Three scripts are supported for the first time: Mandaic, Batak, and Brahmi.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><em>In October of 2010, the other portions of Unicode 6.0 were released: the Unicode Standard Annexes, code charts, and the Unicode Character Database. <br />This allowed vendors to update their implementations of Unicode 6.0 as quickly as possible.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><em>For more information on all of The Unicode Standard, Version 6.0, see </em><a href="http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.0.0/"><em>http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.0.0/</em></a></p>
<p>You can think of this as the "close parenthesis" to end the phrase....</p>

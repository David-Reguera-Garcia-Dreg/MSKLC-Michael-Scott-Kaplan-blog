<p>Over in the Suggestion Box, regular reader <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/yuhong2/ProfileUrlRedirect.ashx">Yuhing Bao</a> asked:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">What do you think about going to you directly via going through PSS?</span></em></p>
<p>He was referring to a conversation going on in the comments of a blog of mine from over 4 years ago titled <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2011/01/31/662550.html" title="Is MSLU still supported?"><strong>Is MSLU still supported?</strong></a>.</p>
<p>I was pointing out how in the specific case of MSLU at that time, if people asked a question of PSS it would make its way to me eventually, and if people asked me directly then it would also make its way to me.</p>
<p>I know that some people are more comfortable with one way, some with the other. They both work, so really I was slightly annoyed when the same request got to me via many different channels but I really did not judge one channel as better than the other.</p>
<p>I mean, I serve at the pleasure of the customer (except perhaps&nbsp;when they annoy me?), so why should I judge them for which way they like to talk unless their way is <strong>every way</strong>? :-)</p>
<hr />
<p>Now this is going back half a decade ago, when the landscape in PSS was pretty different.</p>
<p>These days, when I send notes to specific folks in PSS about writing a KB article on a particular topic, they tell me that someone else does those now. It is no longer PSS writing them based on specific cases where they provided assistance (and KB articles became a way that the help could get to others, whether by another PSS&nbsp;engineer finding it or a customer finding it directly).</p>
<p>And I suddenly realized it had been a while since I had received email from a PSS engineer asking me about a customer question.</p>
<p>Over the past six months I had probably had more interaction with the VP I mentioned in <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/08/29/4633356.html" title="Are you Mr. Kaplan?"><strong>Are you Mr. Kaplan?</strong></a> (and he is now in customer and partner advocacy) than I had with anyone in PSS.</p>
<p>I know product support still exists, thouh now the only trace I see of it is in PSS folk asking questions of some of the distribution lists I'm on.</p>
<p>They get answers and therefore customers still get answers. </p>
<p>So perhaps this change, this shift, this (dare I say it?) re-organization has not impacted Product Support Services in a negative way.</p>
<p>Though I know I am not really contributing a much as I used to.</p>
<p>So while I would have used to have said "ask any way you like!" about MSLU or topics I know about, maybe now I'd say "if you think it is something I know about and you want an answer from me, you should probably ask here, via the Suggestion Box." Because otherwise I may never see the question, and I am probably less likely to be a significant contributor to the response.</p>
<p>if I don't know the answer I'll point you to PSS. And if you ask the question&nbsp;via multiple routes I am less likely to even know about it so perhaps the annoyance factor isn't a factor for me anymore.</p>
<p>So I guess you can just ask whoever and how-many-whoevers you wish to, based on your own personal preferences. This may be the most efficient org structure yet built for customer satisfaction via support.</p>
<p>Well, at least until the next re-org....</p>

After leaving that org, so many things changed. Probably the biggest being that they don&#39;t call themselves PSS anymore - it&#39;s CSS now.</p>

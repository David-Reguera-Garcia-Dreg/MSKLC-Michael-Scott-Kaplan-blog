<p>I was in danger of losing some vacation time.</p>
<p>And therefore, to avoid that fate, I am going to take some time off.</p>
<p>Basically from now until the end of the year.</p>
<p>Now don't worry -- I have some blogs in the hopper.</p>
<p>So I'll appear to be writing, still.</p>
<p>Anticipating&nbsp;a response from management: my biweekly status will be ON VACATION.</p>
<p>I'll turn on my OOO in the morning, and send that invite so my vacation will be on people's schedule.</p>
<p>That invite should not be taken as an invite to join me on my vacation.</p>
<p>I plan to go somewhere that starts with a "T".</p>
<p>It could be Thailand. Or&nbsp;Tokyo.</p>
<p>It could be Tajikistan.Or&nbsp;Turkmenistan. Or even Turkey.</p>
<p>I'll admit Tokch'≈èn seems unlikely at this point.</p>
<p>Maybe somewhere that they speak Tigrinya?</p>
<p>Timbuktu cannot be completely ruled out.</p>
<p>It could be Tulsa.</p>
<p>It could be a visit to see Teri, who I haven't seen for a few years.</p>
<p>Or maybe even a visit to a Taco Del Mar or a Taco Bell. Though these two seem unlikely. I don't anticipate being in the mood for Mexican food.</p>
<p>Try to stay out of Trouble. I plan to avoid that, too....</p>

<p>The T tells that thou thinks that T tilts toward terrific-ness.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

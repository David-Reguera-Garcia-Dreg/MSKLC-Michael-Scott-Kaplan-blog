<p>New ways to support input are really all the rage these days - from IMEs to new IMEs to the soft keyboards of Windows 8 to the Swypes and Swipe Its and Sliders and&nbsp;Touch pals and&nbsp;Shape Writers and so on.</p>
<p>Technically I am not connected to any of these efforts, even as I Continue to crank out new keyboard layouts for Windows (e.g. <strong><a title="What language is that keyboard for?" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2011/11/23/10240896.html">What language is that keyboard for?</a></strong>, <strong><a title="Behind the Cherokee Phonetic layout in Windows 8" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2011/11/09/10235391.html">Behind the Cherokee Phonetic layout in Windows 8</a></strong>,&nbsp;and others).</p>
<p>Though I end up at least indirectly connected o most of them, since no matter how little they resemble hardware keyboards they all tend to sit atop keyboards.</p>
<p>And thus they need to interact with this venerable way to get text entered in by users.</p>
<p>My inbox regularly sees questions pop about some of the new things that don't work properly because of unanticipated design limitations in the support underneath!</p>
<p>In theory such issues could be considered bugs. But since in general the design works on all these platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows NT 3.1</li>
<li>Windows 95</li>
<li>Windows NT 3.5</li>
<li>Windows NT 3.51</li>
<li>Windows 95 OSR2</li>
<li>Windows NT 4.0</li>
<li>Windows 98</li>
<li>Windows 98 SE</li>
<li>Windows Me</li>
<li>Windows 2000</li>
<li>Windows XP</li>
<li>Windows Server 2003</li>
<li>Windows XP SP2</li>
<li>Windows Server 2003 64</li>
<li>Windows XP 64</li>
<li>Vista</li>
<li>Windows Server 2008</li>
<li>Windows 7</li>
<li>Windows Server 2008 R2</li>
</ul>
<p>(and that's not even a complete list!), then I really have no problem looking qt the reported bug that someone's "exciting new world changing input method" runs into, and call it</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000; font-size: small;"><strong>BY DESIGN</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000; font-size: medium;"><strong>BY DESIGN</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000; font-size: large;"><strong>BY DESIGN</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000; font-size: x-large;"><strong>BY DESIGN</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000; font-size: xx-large;"><strong>BY DESIGN</strong></span></p>
<p>without even bothering to feel a little bit embarrassed.</p>
<p>That code has been around for a long time, and a lot of of people depend on its behavior. It <strong>cannot</strong> be changed lightly. Unlike your new code, that no one has ever depended on before.</p>
<p>Frankly, no one has seriously entertained working outside the existing input stack. Which means they've implicitly agreed to work within its rules and limitations.</p>
<p>Perhaps I'll even talk about some of these limitations in the future, if I can sufficiently extract them from their original reports -- I'm not trying to use this Blog as a way to scold these input innovators, except generally like I do in today's blog. :-)</p>

<h1>No one ever doubts me when I tell them SharePoint ate my spec!</h1>

<p>The view from outside of Microsoft is often quite different than the view you get from within.</p>
<p>I was quite recently struck by this fact when I was talking to a designer colleague of mine from the outside who was talking about SharePoint.</p>
<p>It actually started with a question -- a question about collations.</p>
<p>She figured I might know something about them....</p>
<p>Now since SharePoint is hosted by SQL Server, I was able to help her out.</p>
<p><em>For what it's worth&nbsp;she is right about about a lot of the documentation being missing out there, especially about internationalization and world-readiness. I may need to dive in and cover that here at some point!</em></p>
<p>Anyway, she found my initial, visceral reaction to the word "SharePoint" to&nbsp;be amusing.</p>
<p>She showed me some of the amazing things she and her team were doing with it, and I was blown away.</p>
<p>Wow!</p>
<p>Why don't our internal sites ever look like this?</p>
<p>"<em>You don't have expert designers producing good sites. We can be pretty expensive though, and if I were Microsoft I'd probably want the people who produce good looking sites to be working for customers in Premiere Support or Consulting Services, where they can&nbsp;do work that will&nbsp;translate into money.. I&nbsp;mean, what does one really&nbsp;get from creating an internal&nbsp;site</em>?"</p>
<p>She has a point there.</p>
<p>Inside of Microsoft, there are lots of SharePoint sites. Some of them are okay.</p>
<p>Others of them are horrendous scary things where you keep an extra copy before you upload any content.</p>
<p>Teachers would never buy</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: large;">"The dog ate my homework!"</span></p>
<p>if you made the claim. It actually did happen to me once. I even had the half eaten work but I still wasn't believed.</p>
<p>But if you were to tell people on your team</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: large;">"The SharePoint site ate my spec!"</span></p>
<p>or</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: large;">"The document got lost in the SharePoint site upgrade!"</span></p>
<p>or</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: large;">"The file got lost when the SharePoint site was migrated!"</span></p>
<p>then everyone believes you.</p>
<p>Because when each site is thrown together by non-designers -- by random people on the team, it's a mess.</p>
<p>No one ever gets everything off it because too many weird places are there with random docs.</p>
<p>I don't even have the the heart to blame SharePoint.&nbsp;I mean, it's&nbsp;hardly&nbsp;their fault. We're talking about a bunch of amateurs using their product, without any real expertise.</p>
<p>But the people the product is designed for do amazing things with it -- they've been enjoying huge adoption and a lot of growth as a product.</p>
<p>Things look so different on the outside....</p>

</ul>
<p>Now in the past, I've written <strong><a title="The Locales of Windows 7, all divvied up" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2011/05/24/10167604.html">The Locales of Windows 7, all divvied up</a></strong>, which included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Table 1: the locales representing languages into which Windows 7 localizes</li>
<li>Table 2: the locales representing languages for which Windows creates Language Interface Packs, aka LIPs</li>
<li>Table 3: locales whose identifiers are not directly associated with any localizations of Windows, even if a related identifier might make for one representing a suitable localization</li>
</ul>
<p>I've also written the sequel, <strong><a title="The Locales of Windows 7, divvied up further" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2011/07/07/10183904.html">The Locales of Windows 7, divvied up further</a></strong>, which included the slihttky more niche:</p>
<ul>
<li>Table 4: the locales into which Windows Server 2008 R2 is localized</li>
<li>Table 5: the locales into which PowerShell is localized, by Microsoft</li>
<li>Table 6: the locales into which Visual Studio is localized, by Microsoft</li>
</ul>
<p>And&nbsp;in <strong><a title="The evolving Story of Locale Support, part 5 (...until the decision was made to not refuse to add it)" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2011/11/08/10234995.html">The evolving Story of Locale Support, part 5 (...until the decision was made to not refuse to add it)</a></strong>, which listed&nbsp;a bunch of locales added to Windows 8 that at some point might make nice entries to an updated version of <strong>Table 3</strong>.</p>
<p>I didn't comment about how many of them&nbsp;might be added to a nice updated version of <strong>Table 2</strong>, because that list is still confidential info. Though if history is a guide then some of the new languqages and some of te exiting ones might fit there.</p>
<p>Also,&nbsp;in <strong><a title="The evolving Story of Locale Support, part 2 (raising the roof on keyboards)" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2011/11/02/10232468.html">The evolving Story of Locale Support, part 2 (raising the roof on keyboards)</a></strong>, I Listed a bunch of new keyboards added to Windows 8, some of which have no LCIDs, as I pointed out in that very blog (I described some of&nbsp;my implementation concerns on this matter in <strong><a title="The evolving Story of Locale Support, part 11: What language is that keyboard for?" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2011/11/23/10240896.html">The evolving Story of Locale Support, part 11: What language is that keyboard for?</a></strong>).</p>
<p>But there is yet another list -- a missing list.</p>
<p>You see, <strong>Table 3</strong> should have, rather than being called</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Table 3: locales whose identifiers are not directly associated with any localizations of Windows, even if a related identifier might make for one representing a suitable localization</p>
<p>should have instead been more accurately called</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Table 3: locales <strong>supported by Windows 7</strong> whose identifiers are not directly associated with any localizations of Windows, even if a related identifier might make for one representing a suitable localization</p>
<p>Because just yesterday the question was asked:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;"><em><span face="Calibri" size="3">I am wondering if en-HK is a supported culture in Windows 7? </span><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/goglobal/bb964664"><span style="color: #0000ff;" face="Calibri" size="3" color="#0000ff">From this document</span></a><span size="3"><span face="Calibri">, it says it&rsquo;s supported in Windows XP &amp; <br />Server 2003, but yet I get a CultureNotFoundException trying to instantiate the culture with &ldquo;en-HK&rdquo; or it&rsquo;s LCID 15369.</span></span></em></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;"><em><span size="3"><span face="Calibri">Any suggestions? If not, please forward to a more appropriate alias, thanks.</span></span></em></span></p>
<p>One of the people&nbsp;(Alexander)&nbsp;got that mail forwarded it to me, and he (Alexander) is on the small list of people I have Outlook set to let the mail get to me even though I'm on vacation (as I mentioned in <strong><a title="I plan to go somewhere that starts with a &quot;T&quot;." href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2011/12/07/10244934.html">I plan to go somewhere that starts with a "T"</a></strong>).</p>
<p>And it is an interesting question, so I thought I'd take it up now!</p>
<p>The problems with that <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/goglobal/bb964664">Locale IDs Assigned by Microsoft</a>&nbsp;web page are numerous, and I'll get into that some other day.</p>
<p>But for now I'll give a first crack at yet another table:</p>

<p>&nbsp;Note that <strong>en-HK</strong> is one of the many locales on this list.</p>
<p>Some also recognize Urdu - India,which I discussed in <strong><a title="Where's the other Urdu?" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2010/07/18/10039492.html">Where's the other Urdu?</a></strong>, a blog where I also talked about the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/goglobal/bb964664">Locale IDs Assigned by Microsoft</a>&nbsp;page and some of its problems.</p>
<p>I'd love to comment about some of the reasons why a locale would end up here on this page, reserved, but in many cases the reasons would be mere suppositions on my part.</p>
<p>I mean I know about my fruitless campaign for an Urdu - India that was champoioned by and ulimately tied to a Microsoft VP who left under unhappy at the lack of direction of many efforts he championed in the unused potential of Microsoft India&nbsp;-- technologies that ultimately were marginalized and now have no owners (an issue I also was unable to influence in the endd since no one had the resources to take&nbsp;the work&nbsp;on). But that's heroic tale of throwing an elbow that didn't connect, a little too much inside baseball, and something that ultimatelty blew my stack on sports metaphors that only some o my readers will get.</p>
<p>Alternately,&nbsp;I know&nbsp;about&nbsp;the campaign of harassment by a professor that led to the <strong>Yiddish locale</strong> being added to this list,&nbsp;and I could revel my readers with tales like that. But although it came to me from a reputable source, it is still hearsay -- and I'd like to keep blogs admissible. :-)</p>
<p>Kind of hints at future <strong>Table 8</strong>: Locale lists that are broken in one or more ways. :-)</p>
<p>But for now, that <strong>Table 7</strong> list should do. And I got a question of a customer (albeit an internal customer) answered, which id good since i still do serve at the pleasure of the customer....</p>

<p><strong>cheong00</strong> on 21 Dec 2011 5:50 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>IMO, it seems the only difference between zh-HK and en-HK would be DateTime format difference (I currently cannot think of the others. Even in zh-HK, people has been set the currency format to HK$#,##0.00 ). Is there a point for implementing a seperate English based locale for Hong Kong?</p>
<p>There may be, just weak. So I guess this is why it haven&#39;t been implemented as of Windows 8.</p>

<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 21 Dec 2011 6:25 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>I suspect the lack of a proven need for the locale is the main reason it was not added, actually.</p>

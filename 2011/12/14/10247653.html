<p style="padding-left: 30px;">So it started the other day.</p>
<p>On the Unicode List.</p>
<p>Andreas Priliop asked:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">Arabic letter U+0682 shows two dots above. It has the cryptic remark "not used in modern Pashto". But was it ever used?</span></em><br /><br /><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">The new 2011 edition of German standard DIN 31635&nbsp; "Romanization of the Arabic Alphabet"&nbsp; <a href="http://www.beuth.de/en/standard/din-31635/140593750" target="_blank">http://www.beuth.de/en/standard/din-31635/140593750</a>&nbsp;shows the real archaic Pashto letter on page 22.</span></em><br /><br /><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">It has one dot above and one dot below, corresponding to Pashto U+0696 and U+069A. </span></em><br /><br /><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">This is also the form shown in "Lehrbuch des Pashto (Afghanisch)" von Manfred Lorenz.</span></em><br /><br /><br /><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">/* The current form for [dz] is U+0681. */</span></em></p>
<p>What he didn't realize was this was not the first version of an annotation for this letter.</p>
<p>We then had some people weigh in, like Ken Whistler:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">To understand where the "cryptic" remark came from, you need to know more about the history of the character in the standard.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">U+0682 was encoded in Unicode 1.0. I don't have the material in hand right at the moment to track down its original source, but for these kinds of extensions to Arabic dating back to Unicode 1.0, it most likely in some poorly resolved handwritten or photocopied source labelled "Pashto" but without much analysis.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">However researching the exact details for that turns out, in Unicode 1.0 the character was published with a note "Pashto".</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">On February 13, 2003, Roozbeh Pournader sent a note around with a number of comments of Arabic character extensions and annotations. Among those notes was the statement:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">C6. For 0682: The comment is wrong. This is not used in modern Pashto&nbsp;(just rechecked with my Pashto dictionaries). I am back from Kabul&nbsp;doing a study of computer requirements of Pashto and didn't see this&nbsp;anywhere. I guess we should send a public email and ask if anybody&nbsp;knows what this is. [Just an alert. Don't do anything for now.]</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">Then on March 19, 2003, Roozbeh followed up with another note:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><span style="color: #800000; font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;" color="#800000">&nbsp;&gt; 3. Comment for 0682: Remove 'Pashto'. This is not used in</span><br /><span style="color: #800000; font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;" color="#800000"> &gt; modern Pashto.</span><br /><span style="color: #800000; font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;" color="#800000"> &gt; Never. And not in loanwords. (May possibly be old Pashto.)</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;"><span style="color: #800000;" color="#800000"></span>Based on that note, and with no further clarification provided by anyone on the issue, I and the other editors modified the annotation in the Unicode *4.0* names list, so that it read "not used in modern Pashto".</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">It has remained that way in the names list since that date.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">If Andreas (or anyone else) has better information, that can certainly be submitted, and the editors can then work to further clarify any annotation for the character.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">My own suspicion is that the original form from Unicode 1.0 may have been a hard-to-interpret glyph alternative for 0681. Note another note on the unicode email list from 2001, from Vladimir Ivanov. This note doesn't address 0682 specifically, but does raise questions about the exact nature and shape&nbsp;of the diacritic above the hah for dze in Pashto usage:</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">==============================================================</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fri, 8 Jun 2001 07:27:11 +0400</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">My Pashto informants call it "dI paxto alifbe", saying it has 10 extra =</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">letters.</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">Letter "dze" is represented in Unicode by U+0681 "Arabic letter heh with =</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">hamza above",</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">though the sign above heh is not exactly hamza. It is a zigzag-like sign =</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">of the same height as hamza, but they are well distinguished. My =</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">informants could not recall any special name for it.</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">If you use "heh with hamza above", people usually accept it as a =</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">substitute, saying that "computer is not able to build a real Pashto =</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">letter" (?!).</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">I could not find such a letter in Unicode. I would be glad to hear some =</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">comments on&nbsp; it.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">Sicerely,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">Vladimir Ivanov</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">==============================================================</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;some others weighed in, in small ways.</p>
<p>They all meant well, but with no new info to impart.</p>
<p>Finally, Ron weighed in with what looked like the answer:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">I think I have an answer to a possible source of U+0682:</span></em><br /><br /><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">Grammar of the Pasto or Language of the Afghans, Compared with the&nbsp;Iranian and North-Indian Idioms. By Dr. Ernest Trumpp. London and&nbsp; Tuebingen, 1873. (Available from Google Books)</span></em><br /><br /><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">Page 1 (Page 24 of the PDF download from Google Books):</span></em><br /><br /><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">"Only one consonant has been left indistinct, the media [U+0685] d (=&nbsp; dz), which is not distinguished from its tenuis [U+0685] t (= ts) by&nbsp; separate diacritical marks. We have endeavoured to supply this want by&nbsp; placing two dots above [U+062D], viz. [U+0682], as for a foreigner at&nbsp; </span></em><br /><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">any rate the non-distinction of the two sounds must prove very&nbsp; troublesome."</span></em><br /><br /><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">Indeed, some other 19th century grammars refer to Pashto [ts] and [dz]&nbsp;as distinct letters but typeset them identically with three dots above&nbsp;(that is, like U+0685). Here are two such examples:</span></em><br /><br /><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">A Grammar of the Pukkhto or Pukshto Language on a New and Improved&nbsp;System, by Henry Walter Bellew, London 1867 (see alphabet table on&nbsp;page 3, that is page 20 of the PDF download from Google Books).</span></em><br /><br /><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">A Grammar of the Pukhto, Pushto, or Language of the Afghans, by&nbsp;Lieutenant H. G. Raverty, Calcutta 1855 (see alphabet table on pages&nbsp;3-4, that is pages 77-78 of the PDF download from Google Books).</span></em><br /><br /><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">So it appears that the character "Hah with two dots vertical above"&nbsp;was a 19th-century attempt to distinguish Pashto [ts] and [dz] for&nbsp;didactic purposes. The convention of writing [dz] using Hah with hamza&nbsp;above (U+0681) appears to have emerged later. There are still some&nbsp;unanswered questions.</span></em><br /><br /><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">- Why did a character from a 19th-century book get coded in Unicode?&nbsp;Did it ever receive wider use beyond Trumpp's book?</span></em><br /><br /><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">- Is the present hamza convention a development of the two vertical&nbsp;dots proposal, or are they unrelated? About a year ago I worked with&nbsp;several Afghan expatriates living in Southern California, and in&nbsp;handwriting they would typically join two diacritical dots as a&nbsp;squiggle rather than a line (which is more common in Arabic). One&nbsp;could see how two vertical dots might develop into a vertical squiggle&nbsp;and later into a hamza, especially given the note by Vladimir Ivanov&nbsp;cited below. But this is only a conjecture at this point.</span></em><br /><br /><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">Anyway, I hope to have contributed a few pieces towards solving the puzzle :-)</span></em><br /><br /><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">-Ron.</span></em></p>
<p>Nw under ordinary circumstances, this would probably not have ben encoded without a ot more effort.</p>
<p>But in those early days, a lot of stuff slipped in.</p>
<p>Including what may have been an early, experimental linguistic innovation never ultimqately picked up in the language that this letter may indeed have been.</p>
<p>Now in most fonts that cover Arabic:</p>
<p><a href="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/8360.0682.jpg"><img style="max-width: 550px;" border="0" alt="" src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/8360.0682.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>And as we say, "every character has a story."</p>
<p>Some just need deeper digging than others!</p>

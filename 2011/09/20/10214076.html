<p>Perhaps you read <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/tags/multiple+sclerosis/default.aspx">somewhere</a>&nbsp;that I have Multiple Sclerosis.</p>
<p>It's true.</p>
<p>I have had people ask me about my prognosis, with my MS.</p>
<p>And for some people, my <strong><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2009/11/27/9929280.html">prognosis can even be a soup question</a></strong>.</p>
<p>But the one thing I had was some perspective.</p>
<p>The kind or perspective that being in the "last phase of Multiple Sclerosis, <strong>progressive</strong> MS, the one that even the pharmaceutical companies have largely given better up on, since the market for lucrative ways to sell long term hypoethtical&nbsp;hope for $1000 a month is covered by insurance....</p>
<p>But the one thing that MS has taught me even when the fat lady is singing that this show can find a whole new to start up.</p>
<p>In&nbsp;the beginning of last week I went to see my neurolgist&nbsp;so she renew my prescriptions (they have&nbsp;to see you every once in a while!), but this time&nbsp;I had news:&nbsp;I was showing some new symptoms! Like something acute, you know!</p>
<p>Some thing that hasn't happened for years.</p>
<p>She recommended a 3-day course of methylprednisolone&nbsp;(a steroid), kind of a mainstay of assisting in relapsing piece of relapsing/remitting multiple sclerosis....</p>
<p>But I was less convinced, since&nbsp;in the last 20 years, methylpred seemed to be less useful over time....</p>
<p>And then on Friday, I was at a party. A wine tasting party.</p>
<p>The name of the party was <strong>La Figa</strong>.</p>
<p><em>I swear I didn't know what that mean in French slang until later....</em></p>
<p>Somewhere between halfway in between half of the second glass (a nice chardonnay)&nbsp;and half of the second (a Syrah I had been admiring), I was stuttering.</p>
<p>Well, not really stuttering.</p>
<p>I mean, you know when Porky Pig</p>
<p><iframe height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/gBzJGckMYO4" frameborder="0" width="420" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>tries to say "gug-guh-guh- that's all folks", where he works around his inability to say "Goodnight folks" by saying "That's all folks!", right?</p>
<p>Yes a stutter. But in my case it was some type of aphasia, much more of an expressive aphasia than Porky's presumed&nbsp;dysarthria.</p>
<p>I knew what I wanted to say, but before I actually said it I could feel the wrong word coming out, and rather than saying the wrong thing I found some other thing to say. A thing that sometimes made less sense of the context.</p>
<p>A slightly more&nbsp;cerebral version of what Porky was doing, which is ironic since his solution made the same intended point with while I would often fail to make the original point entirely.</p>
<p>As the evening progressed and I&nbsp;mentally workout out in my Manter &amp;&nbsp;Gatz&nbsp;what was happening -- not dysarhria, and not a true Wernick's (receptive) aphasia though with similar impact but not&nbsp;a&nbsp;Brocca's (expressive)&nbsp;aphasis,&nbsp;either.</p>
<p>I eventally I ended up in the emergecy room, as although a stroke or TIAs were unlikely, I was being foolish to not make sure.</p>
<p>And in the end, no&nbsp;bleed or TIA, but the most active MRI in terms of enhancing MS lesions in almost a decade!</p>
<p>And now suddenly all the drugs denied to progressive MS are back on the table -- Copaxone and Tysabrri and the rest.</p>
<p>It's a whole new ballgame, people!</p>

<p>Maybe I am not hip on the whole disease, but am I getting that the wine + steroid = stuttering &amp; increased brain activity?</p>

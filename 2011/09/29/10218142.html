<p>Stephen asks:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">Hi,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">We have been trying to use Welsh and found that the NLS table (<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/goglobal/bb896001.aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/goglobal/bb896001.aspx</a>) maps Welsh to codepage 1252.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">This has confused me because Welsh can contain Ux0174 (and others) that are not in 1252. (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/handson/user/welsh.mspx">http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/handson/user/welsh.mspx</a>)</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">Is there going to be any changes to this mapping to create a Welsh codepage, or an equivalent of Celtic?</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">Thanks</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">Stephen</span></p>
<p>Unfortunately, we really are out of the code page creation business. It was never terribly lucrative.</p>
<p>And almost every language fails the test here now....</p>
<p>So Welsh has lots of distinguished company.</p>
<p>But use Unicode to support them all!</p>

<p><strong>John Cowan</strong> on 29 Sep 2011 11:02 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>In fact &quot;welsh&quot; and &quot;welch&quot; are interchangeable here: a &quot;welsher&quot; is someone (either the bookie or the customer) who fails to pay what they owe on a bet. &nbsp;In extended usage it can refer to any business transaction rather than just a bet. &nbsp;So you welshed on the codepage promise.</p>
<p>The exact origin of the verb is not known. &nbsp;Needless to say, the Welsh take it as just another slur perpetrated by the English: &quot;Taffy was a Welshman / Taffy was a thief&quot; and all that.</p>
<p>(The Royal Welch Fusiliers were until 2006 an infantry regiment of the British Army, so named because their ceremonial commander is the Prince of Wales. &nbsp;The archaic spelling dates back to the founding of the regiment in 1689, and has nothing to do with welshing/welching.)</p>

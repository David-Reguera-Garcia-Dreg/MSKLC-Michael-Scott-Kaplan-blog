<h1>Some filler, and a health update....</h1>

<p>My MS has been getting worse recently.</p>
<p>Just in the last few weeks, I mean.</p>
<p>I think it may be related to the heat, though this is the mildest Seattle summer in years, so it can't just be that.</p>
<p>My finger dexterity is way off, and my balance is even worse than usual. Even around the house.</p>
<p>And I'm having more handrails added in the bathroom (the landlord is pretty flexible about this, it keeps them from needing to move me to an ADA unit or retrofit the one I'm in).</p>
<p>Also, I know that when typing I officially have more typos than correctly typed letters, which has two direct impacts:</p>
<ul>
<li>it (ironically) improves my accuracy, since if most of what I type is wrong I end up watching it more carefully, and</li>
<li>it tremendously slows down typing speed, which has me looking at Dragon again for longer pieces, after being able to set it aside for a while.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully it is temporary, but I wouldn't ever make book on that, since it doesn't always work out that way.</p>
<p>If you know what I mean.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm actually working hard on blogs for tomorrow and the day after, covering some holes in our Hong Kong support.</p>
<p>So you can think of today as some filler, and a health update....</p>

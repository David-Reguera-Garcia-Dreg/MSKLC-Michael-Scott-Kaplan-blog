<h1>You can't always blame the IME....</h1>

<p>Over in the Suggestion Box, Matthew Oakley asked:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">Hi. I am using Ms Access as a front end to a mysql database for a web testing system. As far as I can tell, everything is set to use utf-8. However, when I type the korean character which is unicode c548 (using IME), it ends up stored in the database as ec95. When I type the same character in the webpage, it is stored in the same database as bec8. I have no idea what is going on! English is stored perfectly, ime seems to be creating a nightmare. Could you make a topic explaining what IME does in depth?</span></em></p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>The character in question, U+c548, is also known as HANGUL SYLLABLE IEUNG A NIEUN.</p>
<p>This one:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: xx-large;">안</span></p>
<p>Now the bytes in UTF-8 for this character would be:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: xx-large;">EC 95 88</span></p>
<p>Notice the first two bytes.</p>
<p>They look a lot like the two bytes Matthew said were ending up in the database.</p>
<p>I don't know aabout you, but I'm wth Leroy Jethro Gibbs -- I don't believe in coincidences!</p>
<p>Now&nbsp;the IME works just fine (you can get the letter in question by typing&nbsp; D K S or IEUNG A NIEUN that is interpreted as ᄋ ᅡ ᆫ , which gets assembled the right way on any version of Access).</p>
<p><em>I just tried it here.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But something else is at work here, something that is corrupting the text....</p>
<p>Maybe something along the lines of custom processing code?</p>
<p>Or the data layer? Access is not a paragon of UTF-8 support.</p>
<p>It isn't the IME....</p>

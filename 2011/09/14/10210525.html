<p style="padding-left: 90px;">Hi Michael,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;">I just read your post about font substitution, which is why I know you're likely to have the answer to my question!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;">I am running Windows XP (English), but I work for a Japanese company so I get a lot of emails in Japanese.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;">The problem is that "ＭＳ Ｐゴシック" (MS P Gothic) is set as the default font for Outlook on everyone's PC, even if they are non-Japanese and even if they are running the English version of the OS. This appears to be the policy of my company's Help Desk.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;">Since I can't change their policy, and I certainly can't go around secretly to everyone's machine and change their default font, I started looking at Font Substitution as a possible way to silently replace their horrible MS P Gothic font with a nicer one. (Note that I'm only trying to replace the Latin character set, which looks horrible. The Japanese character set in MS P Gothic looks just fine.)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;">Is there any way to do this? I tried adding a font substitution entry in the registry as follows, but it didn't work.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;">[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\FontSubstitutes]<br />"ＭＳ Ｐゴシック,0"="Tahoma"</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;">What would you suggest?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;">Many thanks in advance for your help!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;">Cheers,<br />Will.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no good answer here for such a global change, beyond really encouraging people to move to <strong>Meiryo</strong> or <strong>Meiryo UI</strong> (which is difficult if they're using XP).</p>
<p>There is a real lack of a global system to subvert the meaning of the fonts used when you view email, other than perhaps the settings in Outlook.</p>
<p><em>Note that these settings can be in different parts of the Outlook user interface in different versions, so you may need to search a bit to figure out where the settings are in your version....</em></p>
<p>Basically, there are two big changes:</p>
<p>First, make sure you view all email as plain text:</p>
<p><img src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/3583.outlook01.jpg" /></p>
<p>This will largely take the particular font out of the equation entirely.</p>
<p>Then, to be sure you get the font you want, make sure to explicitly set the font for plain text mails:</p>
<p><img src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/2148.outlook02.jpg" /></p>
<p>This should spare you a lot of the Latin text that uses a font you don't want.</p>
<p>Now of course when you replay to email the cat may be out of the bag, and people will see you've dumped their formatting. I only mention this so you won't be blindsided by it later.... :-)</p>

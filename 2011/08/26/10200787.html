<p>It's possible to go a long way when you don't even exist.</p>
<p>Look how it worked out for the <strong><a title="Every character has a story #15: CAPITAL SHARP S (not encoded)" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/09/25/473632.html">Capital</a></strong><strong>&nbsp;<a title="Every character has a story #26: CAPITAL SHARP S (might be encoded?)" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/05/03/2398227.html">Sharp</a></strong><strong>&nbsp;<a title="Every character has a story #28: U+1e9e (CAPITAL SHARP S)" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/08/24/4536979.html">S</a></strong>? :-)</p>
<p>Some of them get baked into ISO 8859 and Unicode much earlier though.</p>
<p>Like</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: x-large;">Ţ</span> (U+0162,&nbsp;aka&nbsp;LATIN CAPITAL LETTER T WITH CEDILLA)</li>
<li><span style="font-size: x-large;">ţ&nbsp;</span> (U+0163, aka&nbsp;LATIN SMALL LETTER T WITH CEDILLA)</li>
</ul>
<p>for example.</p>
<p>Yes, there was a proposal for it to be used in French once upon a time, as per <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedilla#A_proposal_for_the_use_of_the_cedilla_with_the_letter_T_in_French">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>In 1868, Ambroise Firmin-Didot suggested in his book Observations sur l'orthographe, ou ortografie, fran&ccedil;aise (Observations on French Spelling) that French phonetics could be better regularized by adding a cedilla beneath the letter "t" in some words. For example, it is well-known that in the suffix -tion this letter is usually not pronounced as (or close to) <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/t/</span> in either French or English. It has to be distinctly learned that in words such as French diplomatie (but not diplomatique) and English action it is pronounced <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/s/</span> and <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/ʃ/</span>, respectively (but not in active in either language). A similar effect occurs with other prefixes or within words also in French and English, such as partial where t is pronounced <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/s/</span> and <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/ʃ/</span> respectively. Firmin-Didot surmised that a new character could be added to French orthography. A similar letter, the t-comma, does exist in Romanian, but it has a comma accent, not a cedilla one.</em></p>
<p>But since it never happened, it doesn't count so much.</p>
<p>Let's face it, this one was added for the sake of Romanian.</p>
<p>And we know how that worked out.</p>

<p>Oh well, it will work out some day....</p>

<p><strong>Kemp</strong> on 26 Aug 2011 10:59 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>So, wait. I don&#39;t think I realised the extent of the fail here before. Latin t with cedilla isn&#39;t used anywhere? It was only added (wrongly) in place of Latin t with comma below? I really don&#39;t understand these decision processes...</p>

<p><strong>rjcox</strong> on 27 Aug 2011 2:18 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>@Kemp the implication here that Latin t with comma below is not used led me to look it up in &quot;The Elements of Typographic Style&quot;. Bringhurst says that the undercomma (as he names this diacritic) is actually an artifact of mechanical typewriters, having no proper cedilla a comma was over-typed (in Appendix B).</p>
<p>This would make sense as the use of two spaces after a period, and underscores for emphasis. But unlike those but seems to have become the typographic preference.</p>
<p>Of course this could be an authorial opinion expressed as fact (Bringhurst certainly isn&#39;t short on expressing preference as correctness elsewhere).</p>
<p>However he does state that both T and S undercomma are used in Romanian, and T undercomma also used in Livonian.</p>
<p>And T with cedilla isn&#39;t listed as a used combination.</p>

<p><strong>John Cowan</strong> on 27 Aug 2011 9:57 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Blunders do come to be preferred sometimes. &nbsp;Consider the word &quot;syllabus&quot;, whose OED etymology is sheer comedy:</p>
<p>From modern Latin syllabus, usually referred to an alleged Greek &sigma;ύ&lambda;&lambda;&alpha;&beta;&omicron;&sigmaf;. Syllabus appears to be founded on a corrupt reading syllabos in some early printed editions &mdash; the Medicean MS. has sillabos &mdash; of Cicero Epp. ad Atticum iv. iv, where the reading indicated as correct by comparison with the MS. readings in iv. v. and viii. is sittybas or Greek &sigma;&iota;&tau;&tau;ύ&beta;&alpha;&sigmaf;, accusative plural of sittyba, &sigma;&iota;&tau;&tau;ύ&beta;&alpha; &#39;parchment label&#39; or &#39;title-slip on a book&#39;. (Compare Tyrrell and Purser Correspondence of Cicero nos. 107, 108, 112, Comm. and Adnot. Crit.) Syllabos was gr&aelig;cized by later editors as &sigma;&upsilon;&lambda;&lambda;ά&beta;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigmaf;, from which a spurious &sigma;ύ&lambda;&lambda;&alpha;&beta;&omicron;&sigmaf; was deduced and treated as a derivative of &sigma;&upsilon;&lambda;&lambda;&alpha;&mu;&beta;ά&nu;&epsilon;&iota;&nu; to put together, collect (compare syllable n.)]</p>
<p>Kemp: &nbsp;Not so much a decision process as a lack of recognition of the distinction. &nbsp;It was a rule when 8859-1 through -4 were designed that if the same character appeared in more than one encoding, it always appeared at the same code point. &nbsp;S-comma (for Romanian) and s-cedilla (for Turkish) were merged in ISO 8859-2 and 8859-3 respectively, because it was not realized that they were different, and the Romanian t-comma appeared in the standard as a spurious t-cedilla. &nbsp;For Turkish use, 8859-3 has now been replaced by 8859-9, which does not follow this rule (it is a variant of 8859-1 with Icelandic-specific characters replaced with Turkish ones).</p>
<p>(Sorry about the typos business: that belonged on a different post, but I can&#39;t figure out which.)</p></div>

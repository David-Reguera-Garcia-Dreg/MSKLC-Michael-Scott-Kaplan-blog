<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">Michael,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">I'm splashing around in the character and glyph separation cesspool I have a question pertaining to initial, medial, final, and isolated forms.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">While different code points were encoded as presentation forms for Arabic and Hebrew back in 3.0 for backward compatibility and simplicity (respectively), vowels in a language such as Devenagari, were not supposed to be encoded. Instead the character choice and display was to be left to the renderer.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">However it appears that each form of any particular Devenagari vowel now has an assigned codepoint. Was a decision made between Unicode 3 and 5 to encode all possible presentation forms? Have I&nbsp; stumbled across another "exception to the rule" (which now appears to be the rule rather than the exception)? Is there any language which I can use to demonstrate that a single codepoint may have multiple glyphs which the renderer has to pull from a font?</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">Thanks,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">REC</span></p>
<p>I'll be honest; I'm at a loss here on what on earth he could be referring to.</p>
<p>Unicode didn't change its encoding mode for the various Indic scripts in general, or Devanagari in particular....</p>
<p>Anyone know what he's talking about?</p>

<p>So, I&#39;m at a loss here too.</p>

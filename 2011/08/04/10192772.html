<h1>Without fonts?</h1>

<p>The question I received was:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">hey, thanks for being there.</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">i saw the list of included fonts posted previously. what I, and I think a lot of people are wondering, is how many of those fonts are necessary and how many can be deleted to make room for graphic design specific fonts.</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">&nbsp;the large number of foreign language fonts are of no use to me and I would be very happy to remove them if it was not going to crash the system.</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">thanks for your help</span></em></p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>This would be one of those traditional, good news/bad news kind of stories, I suppose....</p>
<p>Good in the sense that of the hundreds of megabytes of fonts, you can probably pretty much live without most of them.</p>
<p>But bad in the sense that due to system file protection it will be very hard to do, and if you do accomplish it you will be in one of those really unhappy states where you are constantly reminded of everything missing, and where you can run into servicing problems.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it really wouldn't be worth the trouble....</p>

Now I don&#39;t bother: what&#39;s 100MB of fonts on a 1TB drive? If I were a graphic designer, I would definitely keep these fonts in case I had a client who needed other languages on their product!</p>

<p>After <strong><a title="The only way to be impressed by Microsoft is to ignore calendars" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2011/08/01/10191481.html">The only way to be impressed by Microsoft is to ignore calendars</a></strong> and <strong><a title="The &quot;Thai Buddhist&quot; calendar isn&#39;t" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2011/08/02/10191919.html">The "Thai Buddhist" calendar isn't</a></strong>, not to mention the myriad of blogs they point to, it becomes obvious that I'm not a fan of calendar support on Windows.</p>
<p>It's incomplete.</p>
<p>It's buggy.</p>
<p>It's architecturally unsound.</p>
<p>Yet one of the most common questions I get about calendars is:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px"><strong>Why are you limited in what calendars you can select by the current user locale?</strong></p>
<p>Even over in Office people ask me about this one.</p>
<p>After all, they support the notion of letting you pick whatever calendar you want, even if doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>"<strong>Why can't we?</strong>" they ask.</p>
<p>For me, the answer is in the question.</p>
<p>And it has a lot to do with what I think are some philosophical differences between Windows and Office when it comes to International support.</p>
<p>I mean, they need to solve a problem, a hard problem. Like (for example) holiday support. Or address formats.</p>
<p>They build something buggy and incomplete, rife with issues. And they ask us to take it on -- "<strong>with their data as a starting point, since that should make it easier!</strong>"</p>
<p>Only it doesn't -- because there are complicated issues underneath that make it harder to get things to work right.</p>
<p>Issues that they ignore....</p>
<p>And really that's not our style -- we'd rather do it right!</p>
<p>I mean, what's the point in doing it wrong, anyway?</p>
<p>We don't <strong>do</strong> that sort of thing!</p>
<p><span style="font-size:medium"><strong>Well, except for calendars, that is....</strong></span></p>

<p>It happens on a fairly regular basis.</p>
<p>I'll be heading back to my office after grabbing some food really quick.</p>
<p>Maybe it will be a "cheesy chuck" burger from 26, the only cafeteria that properly makes this poorly named but tasty dish.</p>
<p>Or maybe the "Thai spicy" panang curry with chicken/spicy crispy chicken the 9 Typhoon statin provides whenever they see me.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'll be in the kitchen on the way back with my lunch, and&nbsp;people will see me&nbsp;grab 4 cokes.</p>

<p>Yes, <strong>FOUR&nbsp;CANS of Coca-Cola</strong>.</p>
<p>They will look at me funny.</p>
<p>Sometimes they'll say something.</p>
<p>Or even ask about them....</p>
<p>Either way, I'll just shrug and smile, and roll on.</p>
<p>But I'll tell you the truth -- this is to combat the problem I have with remembering to go to the kitchen.</p>
<p>In fact, on the average I forget to pick up the soda half the time.</p>
<p>I'll drink two cans, and put the other two in the fridge.</p>
<p>Then I'll drain that cache on those days when I forget to grab them.</p>
<p>So really it's only ever two at a time!</p>

Is this still true, or is simply easier to get your stash of caffeine from the cafeteria? Also, never having been to Microsoft ever, what&#39;s the food like in general? &#39;Cause that burger looks pretty good! :-)</p>

<p>The burger is delicious!</p>

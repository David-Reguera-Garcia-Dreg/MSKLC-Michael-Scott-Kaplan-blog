<h1>It isn't like bringing Democracy to Cuba, but still...</h1>

<p>In the end, it reminded me of a South Park episode from years ago:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>Sheila</strong>: Alright, fine Kyle, you can go to the Raging Pussies concert if you clean out the garage, shovel the driveway and bring democracy to Cuba.<br /><strong>Kyle</strong>: What's Cuba?<br /><strong>Gerald</strong>: A communist country run by a dictator named Fidel Castro.<br /><strong>Kyle</strong>: And do I have to shovel the whole driveway or just the side the car's on?<br /><strong>Sheila</strong>: The whole thing.<br /><strong>Kyle</strong>: Ah jeez.</p>
<p>It started as a push to get a new requirement added to the Quality Gates, so that failing the test would block the checkin</p>
<p>Meeting the folks who would have to do the work here, some pushback was expected given where we were in the cycle.</p>
<p>But they were going to set the bar pretty high.</p>
<p>They pointed out that without signoff from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/devaan/">Jon Devaan</a> and "the directors" (a senior collection of distinguished engineers, dev directors, and a VP)&nbsp;, it was really too late to get it done.</p>
<p>So I pondered my next move.</p>
<p><a id="Cuba-JPG" class="image" href="http://images.wikia.com/southpark/images/e/e3/Cuba.JPG" data-image-name="Cuba.JPG" itxtbad="1" itxtnodeid="179"><img alt="Cuba.JPG" src="http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20090310184613/southpark/images/thumb/e/e3/Cuba.JPG/250px-Cuba.JPG" width="250" height="181" itxtbad="1" /></a>&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><em><strong>Kyle</strong>: And do I have to shovel the whole driveway or just the side the car's on?</em></span></p>
<p>It wasn't exactly bringing democracy to Cuba, but then the goal was also not as frivolous a a concert, either.</p>
<p>And we're talking about some really smart people, after all....</p>
<p>One of whom oversees the folks in charge of the quality gates, and another the&nbsp;underlying technology in question.</p>
<p>This turned out to be my first solo Exec review (Jan and Dave both had conflicts - I could have delayed, but no sense putting off a trip to the dentist!).</p>
<p>Anyway, the review went really well, and the meeting with the directors went really well too.</p>
<p>In fact, the change made it in earlier this month.</p>
<p>Mainly, I suspect, because some people figured an impossible task was better than a <strong>no</strong>. :-)</p>
<p>Well that and the case was compelling.</p>
<p><em>And Jan/Dave/Chuck were all <strong>very</strong> helpful!</em></p>
<p>Next step: bring Democracy to Cuba!</p>

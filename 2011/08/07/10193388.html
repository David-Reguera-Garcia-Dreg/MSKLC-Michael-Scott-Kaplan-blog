<h1>You can't go home again, MS edition</h1>

<p>It was Thomas Wolfe who first wrote&nbsp;(via fictional author George Webber) that <strong>You can't go home again</strong>.</p>
<p>I don't think I really ever believed that before.</p>
<p>Of course I wasn't going home, but that was largely by choice - I have largely&nbsp;moved on, at this point.</p>
<p>Also,&nbsp;moving from cane to scooter combined&nbsp;with being way too busy at work kept me from my 20th reunion. People could see it all on Facebook anyway, I figured.</p>
<p>But for my grandmother's 95th birthday? I figured I could make an exception....</p>
<p>Fate, it would seem, would have other plans.</p>
<p>Mostly stuck in the&nbsp;iBot now,</p>

<p>I thought about the house as I remembered it and figured everything would be okay.</p>
<p>But after not being in that house for nearly 2&frac12; decades, it seemed like I had forgotten some of the salient details....</p>
<p>Like the fact that one of the steps in front of the house is too steep for 4-wheel mode.</p>
<p>Or none of the steps have railing near them to allow&nbsp;the&nbsp;stair climbing mode.</p>
<p>And I don't trust the stairs down to the recently refinished basement.</p>
<p>Plus the carpeted stairs up to the second floor, I didn't want to necessarily want to trust to the ~440 pound weight that is me.</p>
<p>Perhaps most devastatingly, the thin bathroom door on the first floor, partially obstructed by a bookshelf, was impassable to the iBot.</p>
<p>The net effect?</p>
<p>With extreme measures involving plywood ramps that make the front door largely impassable to otherw, I could just&nbsp;barely&nbsp;get into the house that I grew up in.</p>
<p><em>Provided I left before I had to go to the bathroom....</em></p>
<p>Obviously if I went back, things would likely be better. Though the burned child fears the fire, so there will likely be competing forces dealing with this.</p>
<p>Because when you have MS, sometimes Thomas Wolfe had a point. And you really can't go home again....</p>
<p><em>Not if you need to use the bathroom, at least....</em></p>

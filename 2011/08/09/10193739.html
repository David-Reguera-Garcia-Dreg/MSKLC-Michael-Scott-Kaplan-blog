<p>Remember when I blogged <strong><a title="About the Y1C problem, which really isn't too much of a problem (except maybe in North Korea)..." href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2011/02/26/10134403.html">About the Y1C problem, which really isn't too much of a problem (except maybe in North Korea)...</a></strong>&nbsp;at the beginning of this year?</p>
<p>Darn, I was hoping you had forgotten about that one.</p>
<p>I take it then that you remember this guy too?</p>

<p>As it turns out, I may have understated the problem, slightly.</p>
<p>You see, there actually is perhaps&nbsp;kind of a <strong>Y1C</strong> problem after all....</p>
<p>The good news is that the&nbsp;problem is just in the user interface.</p>
<p>The bad news, however, is that the problem is in the user interface.</p>
<p>More good news: the long standing "date window" UI still exists, even for this calendar.</p>
<p>Roughly offset by related bad news: the default date window for this calendar starts with <strong>00</strong> and ends with <strong>99</strong>.</p>
<p>But there is some good news! The short date format itself has three '<strong>y</strong>' letters in it.</p>
<p>Alas, there is also bad news here: the short date format can be customized.</p>
<p>Maybe someone should do a Y2K-style fixup on this UI, though this issue is more likely to embolden the "switch to Gregorian" folks than inspire user interface changes....</p>

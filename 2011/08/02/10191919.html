<h1>The "Thai Buddhist" calendar isn't</h1>

<p>So yesterday in <strong><a title="The only way to be impressed by Microsoft is to ignore calendars" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2011/08/01/10191481.html">The only way to be impressed by Microsoft is to ignore calendars</a></strong>, I pointed out some real limitations in the calendaring support on Windows.</p>
<p>And there are some serious flaws there.</p>
<p>Now as a part of that, I talked about the wide amount of variation between the different types of calendars.</p>
<p>I talked about the years with 354 days in them.</p>
<p>And the years with 355 days in them.</p>
<p>And also the years with 384 days in them.</p>
<p>And of course, the years with 385 days in them.</p>
<p>But in all of that discussion, I never pointed out the number of days in the Microsoft implementation of the "Thai Buddhist" calendar.</p>
<p><em>And no one called me on it, either. Lucky me....</em></p>
<p>Well, I'll tell you.</p>
<p>It's 365.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Yes, 365.</span></p>
<p>Apparently, while Windows was wise enough to call this calendar <strong>CAL_THAI</strong> while it was thinking about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thai_solar_calendar">Thai Solar calendar</a>&nbsp;(used since the end of the 1800s for most civil matters), the .Net Framework has been calling this the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/tfz5fecb.aspx">ThaiBuddhistCalendar class</a> since it began its life in the early days of this century. Despite the fact that it has pretty much no connection whatsoever to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_calendar">Buddhist Calendar</a>&nbsp;that makes up the Thai Lunar (aka Thai Buddhist) calendar used throughout various parts of Southast Asia.</p>
<p>I guess no one really noticed that one before....</p>
<p>Though perhaps it would make a nice KB article now!</p>
<p>And perhaps some fixes in .Net in the future?</p>
<p>I suppose it's just a name. But sort of an embarrassing one. How'd we miss that one?</p>
<p><em>I'll bet they were wishing they had some constants they could deprecate and replace with the right ones, huh? Win32 has its advantages!</em>&nbsp;:-)</p>

Programmers have been far too lazy in assuming that their software will only run on Earth. Also, everyone assumes that time only runs forwards. At this rate, Raymond&#39;s time machine will have to run on some other operating system that works with non-linear time! :-P</p>

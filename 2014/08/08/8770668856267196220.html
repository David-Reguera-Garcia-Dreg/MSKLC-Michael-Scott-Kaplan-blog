<p><p>It started the other day when a colleague noticed that I was mentioned in the Internet:</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@eteraz/the-death-of-the-urdu-script-9ce935435d90">https://medium.com/@eteraz/the-death-of-the-urdu-script-9ce935435d90</a></p><p>&nbsp;This was the guy I met last year at the Internationalization and Unicode conference who loved the new Urdu Typesetting font.</p><p>I ended up showing him how to use the new font even on downlevel platforms  by using the same font subset feature that I previously showed with the Nyala font in the "Rhymes with Amharic" series on the Blog.</p><p>It suddenly came to me that there were quite a few of these items that no one ever bothered to document anywhere. Even if some people are too short sighted to recognize it, the fact is that the work was needed, and the work was done. </p><p>And I'm glad it's out there, and that it can stay out there for people to follow and enjoy.... </p></p>

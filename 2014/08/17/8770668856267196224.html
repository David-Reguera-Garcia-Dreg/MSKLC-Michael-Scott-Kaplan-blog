<h1>My drink @ Windows on the World with Liz more than a decade ago...</h1>

<p>The year was 2001.</p>
<p>It happened at The Blue Bar inside Windows On the World, high up atop the North Tower of the World Trade Center.</p>
<p>Now it wasn't just before 9/11, because I was in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia for Tamil Internet 2001 at the end of August. The trip's most intriguing issue was that I spent more time in the air than on the ground because Windows XP was going to ship and no one wanted me to take a vacation then. I was a vendor at the time but I was worried of being fired off my contract for being on the wrong side of the world for a month.</p>
<p>In the end, it was just as well since I ended up being trapped in Los Angeles on 9/11 after a breakup that happened on the weekend before. It was weird enough having to consider a car rental from Los Angeles to Seattle; if I had been trapped in Malaysia I might really have been fired off my contract for being away that long.</p>
<p>Anyway, I was in New York earlier in 2001 for a consulting gig, and since my Perfectly Normal Liz happened to be there too, we decided to have an only moderately overpriced drink to get the best view in the world.</p>
<p>I can't remember what we were talking about, and I guess in the scheme of things it really doesn't matter. I certainly wasn't in any danger or anything, but it's hard to think about semi-casually visiting a place that isn't there anymore.</p>
<p>Now that I think about it, Liz isn't there either, which makes this blog depressing and sad on four levels:</p>
<p>• I didn't visit the building akin to the World Trade Center in Malaysia when I had the chance;</p>
<p>• I had just broken up with someone who I thought at the time was a pretty serious girlfriend;</p>
<p>• It reminds me of Liz and yet another of those times that I failed to notice her interest;</p>
<p>• Of course the actual reason to be unhappy, the terrible events of September 11, 2001.</p>
<p>There was a point to the actual blog here, but I can't remember what it was now. I think I'll post it anyway, since I do remember Liz was wearing a pretty hot dress and I teased her about having a date after. One can never get enough reminders about me being oblivious here....</p>

<h1>Sorting it all Out , reborn and reconstituted!</h1>

<p><p>My Blog was recently reconstituted by friend, colleague, and fan of the original Sorting it all Out Jan Kučera as a hosted WordPress Blog at http://siao2.com/ for worldwide access.</p><p>Pretty much all of the blog posts made the move as did the bulk of the comments. In fact, only a few things might be missing here:</p><p>• Some of the pictures may not be there;</p><p>• A few of the samples may be gone;</p><p>• Linking to the original Blog obviously won't work, unfortunately.</p><p>Nevertheless, having full access to nearly a decade of posts has reminded me how much I love ❤ Sorting it all Out. It is a great technical resource with posts that literally do not exist anywhere else. And it covers personal issues, relationships, iBOT situations, multiple sclerosis issues, and more.</p><p>Perhaps most interestingly, the reconstituted Blog had been getting a few hits (maybe forty a day), but on the strength of one tweet on Twitter yesterday, there were over 600. How did that happen? </p></p>

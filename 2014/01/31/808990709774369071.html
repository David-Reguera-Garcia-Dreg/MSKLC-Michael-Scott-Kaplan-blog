It is time for something more positive! <br /><br />At the last Internationalization and Unicode Conference, I had the opportunity to meet with and talk to the person who was so impressed by the Nastaliq font we added to Windows 8 named Urdu Typesetting.<br /><br />It was a great meeting, not only for the chance to meet and talk but to help him solve the problem he had trying to legally use the font in documents and in Apps while running in or on earlier  versions of Windows.<br /><br />The way? In two words, FONT EMBEDDING.<br /><br />I solved the problem years ago with the Nyala font added to Vista for Amharic for friend and colleague Scott Hanselman.<br /><br />He blogged about it here:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/CustomCulturesWinFormsFontEmbeddingCodeWithEthiopianAmharicForVistaAndXP.aspx">http://www.hanselman.com/blog/CustomCulturesWinFormsFontEmbeddingCodeWithEthiopianAmharicForVistaAndXP.aspx</a><br /><br />And in that blog, he pointed to the four blogs of mine on font embedding that explain how to use font embedding properly and thusly solve the problem.<br /><br />Now, to solve the current problem (getting to those four blogs while the Blog itself is down), I must point to one more resource.<br /><br />The Internet Archive, found at http;//archive.org (just in case you haven't heard of it!).<br /><br />It returns unhelpful looking but worth their weight in gold URLs like these ones:<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100115173710/http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/archive/2007/04/14/2128198.aspx">https://web.archive.org/web/20100115173710/http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/archive/2007/04/14/2128198.aspx</a><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100115173720/http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/archive/2007/04/14/2134278.aspx">https://web.archive.org/web/20100115173720/http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/archive/2007/04/14/2134278.aspx</a><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100115173715/http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/archive/2007/04/14/2133650.aspx">https://web.archive.org/web/20100115173715/http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/archive/2007/04/14/2133650.aspx</a><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/201https://web.archive.org/web/20100115173710/http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/archive/2007/04/14/2128198.aspx115173710/http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/archive/2007/04/14/2128198.aspx">https://web.archive.org/web/201https://web.archive.org/web/20100115173710/http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/archive/2007/04/14/2128198.aspx115173710/http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/archive/2007/04/14/2128198.aspx</a><br /><br />And the problem then solves itself!<br /><br />Now that first blog (and some of the others) point to many other arguably famous blogs that answer other questions and solve other problems that can all be retrieved the same way.<br /><br />Thusly, my (currently defunct and unavailable) Blog + The Internet Archive = the solution to everything I have blogged about since the beginning of my Blogging career, with minimal effort and fuss! ;-)<br /><br />Now that is the kind of math I can get behind!

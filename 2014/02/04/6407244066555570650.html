Time for something a little off the topic of anything remotely related to Microsoft.<br /><br />Let's talk about some other people's products and applications that I use. ;-) <br /><br />Just for example, I have had a <strong>Kindle</strong> since it first came out. 1.0, even. I used to read books - both ones I had read before but not in some time, and new books.<br /><br />Now I never upgraded after that first one because for a long time I never saw it adding any features I needed. I'm not truly a typography wonk, so new versions weren't providing anything that I needed.<br /><br /><br />Until they put a free <strong>Kindle App</strong> on Windows Phone, and then I never used my <strong>Kindle</strong>  again.<br /><br />I didn't need to; I now had any book I wanted in the device I most like to use!<br /><br />Nothing could get between me and my <strong>Kindle</strong> <strong>App</strong>.<br /><br />Nothing except for...<br /><br />There is this little company named <strong>Audible</strong>.<br /><br />They read the book for you and more to the point to you, like other technologies such as <strong>Recorded Books</strong> and others   that let you have the book read to you.<br /><br />Because I don't know about you but as long as I can bookmark any  the book I like I really don't need the book itself.<br /><br />That's why I find "deals" about using <strong>Audible</strong> for your  <strong>Kindle</strong> titles like <a href="http://www.geek.com/news/kindle-owners-can-now-download-audible-audio-books-directly-over-wifi-1333249/" target="_blank">Kindle owners can now download Audible audio books directly over WiFi</a> to be freaking hilarious<br /><br />Because if not for the fact that I <em>may</em> have bought the<br /><br />&nbsp;Audible title from Amazon, I might never give Amazon another cent for a book!<br /><br />Now not everyone reads books the same way as I do, so YMMV, but I doubt that I'm the only person who will not be reading books the way I used to read them.<br /><br />Unless Amazon buys Audible or something &nbsp;they may find themselves unable to have control of how books are bought for many people.<br /><br />I mean, it is great that the title might have been bought on Amazon, but it might not have been. And clearly this other company is now in control of discounts and  deals and such.<br /><br />One day, people will come to their senses and not buy two copies of every book, so the fact that Audible uses Amazon by default means that they didn't want to have to rebuild a storefront themselves when Amazon has one. So why not be an Amazon store? ;-)<br /><br />The real advantage that Audible has is that often person reading the book is a celebrity or expert and that having them read it adds extra value that often translates&nbsp;into higher value.<br /><br />Which often translates <br />&nbsp;higher prices. Some of which is likely due to the cost of compensating the celebrity or expert, but there is likely a lot of wiggle room there....<br /><br />Now I  just have to get "Love Monkey" by  Kyle Smith and "How to Embalm Your  Sister and Other Useful Skills" written by Darius the Dark into Audible's collection (both&nbsp;are  in&nbsp;Kindle's!).  Anyone have friends over at Audible? ;-)<br /><br />I guess it isn't really a problem if people are happy to have their books read to them. That is good since it now covers how *I* use Audible. And I have learned a lot. I'll tell you about it in a later blog....<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

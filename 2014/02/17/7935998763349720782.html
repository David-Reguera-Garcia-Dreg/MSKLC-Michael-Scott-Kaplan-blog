<br /><br />It has been made officially clear to me that the Blog I worked on from the end of 2004 until just recently is for all intents and purposes *dead*.<br /><br />In my view that is unfortunate, because by starting just a few years after I started working for Microsoft fulltime, it is a chronicle of Internationalization and World Readiness know how that spans the bulk of my i18N career at Microsoft, at least!<br /><br />As I have shown in another blog <br />here, most of it is still reachable, so although some of the readymade samples are gone, most of the Blog's actual content is still available in a way that cannot be taken away.<br /><br />Long live the amazingly wonderful website called The Internet Archive @ http://archive.org !!<br /><br />Now a part of me wants to find my favorite blogs and liberate them to this new Blog. Perhaps it would be exciting to re-inflate the Blog this way. I would enjoy it, and scrolling through nine years of blogs would be exciting, don't you think? ;-)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

Your blog could sometimes answer things that weren&#39;t answered anywhere else due to the niche topic. Hope you do get a chance (and find the time) to re-post most of it elsewhere, as google doesn&#39;t appear to index archive.org or maybe filters it out...<br /><br />Lesson for others: don&#39;t trust your company with hosting your blog, I guess. Thanks, Microsoft. You&#39;ve wiped a whole bunch of rather rare knowledge off the Internet. Was it really necessary? I know it wasn&#39;t.</div>

Those are rare (once in 3 years?) but critical for many.<br />For exampe, MSKLC related questions like this one (I tried to help a person but it looks like only you can tell the final &#39;truth&#39;):<br /><br />MSKLC makes 4 hardware-related files - for i386, wow64, amd64 and ia64<br />But Windows RT works only on ARM-powered devices such as the new Surface tablet. So keyboard layouts made with the help of MSKLC cannot beused under RT, right?<br /><br />The guy asked me that question in this discussion: http://answers.microsoft.com/thread/6f1faf47-2b13-422a-9faa-30d7d2afa75f<br />where his question (followed by me trying to help him) is on Page 4:<br />http://answers.microsoft.com//message/327dba6f-ae83-4797-a383-17a846516389?threadId=6f1faf47-2b13-422a-9faa-30d7d2afa75f<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Paul<br /><br />ARM-powered devices such as the new Surface tablet. <br /><br />http://answers.microsoft.com/thread/6f1faf47-2b13-422a-9faa-30d7d2afa75f</div>

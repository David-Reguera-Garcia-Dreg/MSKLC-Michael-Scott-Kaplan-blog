<p>Have you ever watched Kill Bill, vol. 2?</p>
<p>There is one very cool scene lasting a very brief time where the late David Carradine tells Uma Thurman what makes Superman unique among superheroes, one that will effect every person a little differently. If you have seen the movie you'll already know what category you're in and if not you can watch one of the dozens of copies of the scene on YouTube like the ones below by just searching on YouTube for the keywords:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Kill Bill volume 2 superman quote</strong></p>
• some people will impatiently not get it;</p>
<p>• most will think that it is kinda a cool way to look at things that is maybe slightly mind blowing;</p>
<p>• a few will lie and claim that they always realized it, just like a few people claim to have realized the fatal plot flaw in The Wizard of Oz movie or Raiders of the Lost Ark or the plot twist at the end of The Sixth Sense;</p>
<p>• another group of people will point out that Mon-El aka Lar Gand of Daxam and other superheroes have the same somewhat unique quality as Superman, perhaps even correcting me on some bizarre small technical point.</p>
<p>Group number one are the ordinary people, group number two are the pretty cool people, group number three might be the uber cool people but are probably the lying jerks, and group number four are the geeks, dorks, and nerds that populate Comicons worldwide!</p>
<p>As a bonus I will point out a flaw in the captioning support in YouTube/Google if you turn on captions for any video other than the first one (where I intentionally embedded the correct English language captions not to show a solution but to help give context to the challenge.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

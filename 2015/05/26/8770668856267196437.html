<p>It was way back in the beginning of 2008 that I blogged about how <a href="../../../2008/01/06/7001564.html" target="_blank">My name is Dragutsky, Michael Dragutsky</a> and it was probably almost a year before that I pretty much wrote about this, my possible family connection to the actor and comedian Gabe Kaplan that I was always told existed <em>until</em> I planned to write about it in that blog post, at which point a disclaimer was recommended.</p>
<p>I bemoaned the fact that I had misled a young graduate student named Rita, even though it was done unintentionally. I even dedicated that blog post to her.</p>
<p>A few years later, she emailed me!</p>
<p>She admitted that it was while essentially Google stalking me, basically checking my story.</p>
<p>Still feeling guilty, I apologized once again. But she forgave me my trespasses, and pointed out that they weren't really trespasses anyway since she was a consenting adult (we both were), and it was a great story at least. I then described my failure to verify the accuracy of the story with Gabe Kaplan, who is now perhaps best known as a celebrity poker player.</p>
<p>Though she reminded me that I *had* sent her flowers the next day, which kind of belies the whole 'one night stand' thing a little. And she pointed out how easy of a time she had finding me with a simple Google search with the keywords KAPLAN DRAGUTSKY.</p>
<p>She also pointed out that she obviously knew much more about me than I knew of her, since she had the whole Blog to use as a source. Oops!</p>
<p>After chatting a bit further, we ended the conversation on friendly terms. Although she made it clear that she knew how to get a hold of me if she needed someone to fix her computer! ;-)</p>

<p>So here I am, watching movies on television at home. A Sunday night James Bond festival, maybe you remember the one that I was inspired by....</p>
<p>The 19th James Bond flick, starring Pierce Brosnan as our hero MI6 agent 007 and Michelle Yeoh as Colonel Wai Lin of the Chinese Army has one particular scene of interest and amusement to keyboard enthusiasts and maybe even some keyboard aficionados.</p>
<p>The mighty secret agent was bested by simple keyboard hardware with which he was unfamiliar!</p>
<p>Now I remember when this movie first came out people I knew were asking whether this was actually a real keyboard.</p>
<p>My answer was simple. I have no idea because I don't know Chinese!</p>

<p>But someone who knows more about Chinese keyboard layouts and Chinese keyboard hardware might take a t the picture and/or the video clip and then provide a more informed opinion....</p>

<p>Anyone want to weigh in?</p>
<p>My official opinion? I do not think that this would be an actual Chinese keyboard, though my IME'based knowledge may be distracting me...I also say that it fails on the accessibility front, and I can't hazard a guess on the font this red keyboard is using!</p>

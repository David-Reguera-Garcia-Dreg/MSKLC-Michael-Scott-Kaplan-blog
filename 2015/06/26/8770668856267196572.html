<p>I thought that I would take it back to topic now, if it's okay with all of you.</p>
<p>Well, more on topic than you might think, at least.</p>
<p>Are you deaf? If you are you may not need this as much. You've already learned more than I can provide.</p>
<p>Have you ever tried to emulate it before? To walk a mile in their shoes, as it were.
It may be worth your while to try....</p>
<p>Now I don't want to minimize the complexities of their things with which they have to deal. But hinting at it can't hurt.</p>
<p>Step 1) Turn captions on for your television.</p>
<p>Step 2) Hit the mute button or turn the volume all the way down.</p>
<p>Step 3) Watch some movies that have some songs in them, and some TV shows with catchy theme songs like Charmed or Smallville or ones with random music during the show like House or Ally McBeal or anything where you can see how well they interlace the captioning with the music and also with the whole show but mainly concentrating on the music.</p>
<p>Do you remember back when MTV had music videos? When the five original VJs (video jockeys) were there?</p>

<p>Martha Quinn? Mark Goodman? Nina Blackwood? Alan Hunter? JJ Jackson?</p>
<p>They, through The Buggles, taught us all how Video Killed the Radio Star, until MTV &amp; VH1 kinda killed off way too much of the videoÂ  itself.</p>
<p>Music videos would be the best way to see how well they interlace things, but you might have to watch a weekly top 40 countdown to see them at this point.</p>
<p>You can also watch some shows like The Daily Show or The Nightly Show or talk shows or the news and see how much variation there is between the "quality" of the integration of the captions and how much you have to either have multiple independent thought tracks or the ability to ignore some aspects of the show in order to pay enough attention to other parts.</p>
<p>In some consulting gigs, I have been able to convince the people planning and/or directing and/or producing music videos to consider how truly awful their art will look if they don't consider these issues. And multiply me by the many people who fly to Los Angeles these days to take jobs like this.</p>

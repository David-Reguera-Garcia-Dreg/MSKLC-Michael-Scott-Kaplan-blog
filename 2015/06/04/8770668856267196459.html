<h1>Updating MSKLC (part 0) for the sake of _____</h1>

<p>There seems to be a theme in many of the communications that manage to reach me these days while I am out on disability, struggling to get better. Well, all the communications that aren't from the agency trying to get back 75% of three days pay and 60% of three others days pay.</p>
<p>It is people asking about MSKLC aka Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator update information.</p>
<p>To be honest, I'm not sure why, since every time I've made the case to Microsoft why either a particular reason or a large sheaf of reasons might suggest that it might be advantageous to do an update that even the best of reasons that might have initially accepted are eventually rejected and/or postponed.</p>
<p>At this point, I'm not sure what is going on with the MSKLC project and whether an update is expected soon, or at all. But I still happen to care about the project and would ultimately like to see some version of my vision of MSKLC expressed in some future update.</p>
<p>The purpose of this series is to answer each of the questions that have been posed to me as best as I can manage, to fill in that blank without any knowledge whatsoever on what Microsoft's plans are here, until:</p>
<p>• I run out of questions and finally manage to communicate that unfulfilled vision, or</p>
<p>• I am explicitly asked by someone from Microsoft to STFU and/or cease and desist from answering these questions, or</p>
<p>• Microsoft releases an actual MSKLC update or at least announces one that they would prefer to shape the tone and content of this series, or</p>
<p>• the black helicopters take me out.</p>
<p>The benefits to me are a form of catharsis to distract me while I'm recovering while allowing for a few on topic posts that some people will find to be interesting. Some of the parts will cover other related areas of interest from accessibility to typography to Unicode and so on.</p>
<p>The benefits to you are whatever keeps you reading my Blog already! &#x1f609;</p>

<h1>It's Accessible, The Natural ly, except on the Sundance channel?</h1>

<p>The Natural is one of the all time great baseball movies, and it's especially fun to watch this Robert Redford movie on the Sundance channel. And the captions distracted me again...</p>
<p>In a key scene between Roy Hobbs and the judge at the end of their first meeting, Robert Redford turns the light on when leaving the room.</p>
<p>The angry judge shields his eyes and yells "You come back here and turn off that infernal light!".</p>

<p>Now I have checked as many different versions as I was able to, from BlueRay to DVD to VHS, and they all look the same for this one particular scene, though there were other differences in other spots. There are also transcripts of the movie that easily find the scene by searching for word "infernal", and it's found every time.</p>
<p>And then, ironically on several levels since it was on the Sundance channel and it one of Robert Redford's iconic roles and it was Robert Redford himself whose character elicited the statement, the scene caption that was there was not "infernal" but "inferno".</p>
<p>Oops?!? ;-)</p>
<p>Well, I hardly think that it was done with any kind of intent to deceive, but obviously some kind of process took place here. I doubt the director Barry Levinson would be pleased to have the script not be followed.</p>
<p>It may be pedantic and obsessive compulsive and overly detail oriented for me to have noticed it and even more so for me to be blogging about it the very next day, but I suppose that is just all a side effect of my asperger syndrome/autism spectrum disorder, if you know what I mean!</p>

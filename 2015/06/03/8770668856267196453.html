<p>In the mostly forgettable 2001 movie <strong>Driven</strong>, there is one particularly cool scene with Kip Pardue and Estella Warren.</p>
<p>I saw the movie on video a few years later with a woman I was dating named Lisa, who insisted quite vigorously that Estella's trick of corkscrewing up from the bottom of the pool with legs vertically was not a stunt.</p>

<p>She is actually the second Lisa I've known in the context of swimming; the first Lisa was someone I knew the summer before my freshman year of high school. After spending too much of the summer swimming and thinking that we were kinda dating, I learned on my first day of high school that we weren't really dating at all, or at least not in any way that the girl older than me would ever admit in front of her friends.</p>
<p>In any case, Lisa number two was actually dating me briefly and although not an Olympic level swimmer she was able to prove that Estella Warren was probably not faking this and that if anything the people filming it could have done a better job.</p>
<p>Although it might have distracted from the actual story, in the case of <strong>Driven</strong> this might not have been such a bad thing....</p>

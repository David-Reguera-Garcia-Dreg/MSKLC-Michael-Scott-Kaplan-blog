<h1>Where on earth are the bees going?</h1>

<p>The most recent Real Time with Bill Maher included a conversation with Ed Begley, Jr. about several different topics, including CCD (Colony Collapse Disorder), the problem that science generally considers to be the reason that so many beehives are dying.</p>
<p>CCD is interesting because even though naming a problem is not going to solve it, naming it can tend to at least focus the conversation if nothing else. The cable TV channel Pivot has been rerunning the documentary <strong>Vanishing of the Bees</strong> that has several unique advantages</p>
<p>• it is one of the first somewhat recent documentary that suggests the pesticide family of neonicotinoids are the cause (which they are still saying today);</p>
<p>• although there have been several more recent documentaries on the topic, this one leaves enough wild theories on the table that it can appeal to a broader range of people;</p>
<p>• I assume that it is cheaper than the more recent documentary specials, which is a perfect way to fill up time for a channel whose primary claim to fame these days is reruns of shows like Buffy and Veronica Mars under the banner of female empowerment.</p>
<p>Are these many documentaries right about why all the worker bees of so many hives are simply disappearing and leaving behind a queen and some babies? Who knows, really?</p>
<p>Personally, I think our main chance for finding a solution is having competing corporate interests fight it out to try to solve the problem. Though since that will just lead to more high fructose corn syrup aka corn sugar, it's a pretty lousy solution.</p>
<p>Maybe the bees are tired of supporting our worldwide dicking around with our problems and they're tired of carrying us. Although I tend to doubt self awareness in bees, there is a part of me that would like to think that maybe the bees are trying to teach us something.</p>
<p>Now all we have to do is learn it.</p>

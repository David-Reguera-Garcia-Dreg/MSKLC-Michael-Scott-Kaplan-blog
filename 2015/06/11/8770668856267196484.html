<h1>Updating MSKLC (part 3) for the sake of emoticons and [implied] racism?</h1>

<p>Unicode has made a few questionable decisions over the years.</p>
<p>Although most of them can be ignored so we can all move on, one of them is so bad that we're practically speaking in the middle of a race war now!</p>
<p>And that somewhere isÂ between emoji and emoticons.</p>
<p>So anytime I see a link talking about emoticon interoperability that finds a blog post on my Blog talking about the problem entitled <strong>emoticon interoperability can be a nightmare. Or hilarious. Whichever.</strong> I know I was wrong. It is ALWAYS a freaking nightmare.</p>
<p>Whenever anyone has seen a news story about multiracial emoticons or a reference to The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore talking about the same thing and they wonder how MSKLC will be affected, I ask then plead then tell them to walk away as quickly as possible. Or maybe even run.</p>
<p>Because in the end we can dislike letters, we can despise scripts, we can disagree with implementations, and we can dissent from language choices.</p>
<p>But it was only by putting faces into the mix that people decided to make it about <strong>hate</strong>.</p>
<p>In my humble opinion, that is the kind of thing that makes us less accessible, less World-Ready, more a font of ignorance than anything else.</p>
<p>And in my not so humble opinion MSKLC should never stoop to that level. MSKLC is better than that.</p>

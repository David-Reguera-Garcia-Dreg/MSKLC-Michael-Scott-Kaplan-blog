<h1>In the movie Caddyshack, is it Cooter or Kuder?</h1>

<p>You might remember the movie Caddyshack from the time of my youth and the youth of many others from that decade known as the 80's.</p>
<p>It simultaneously taught everyone how I was making money as a youngster and was a rich source of stories later on in life. I was proud to be a part of the cult following that it inspired.</p>
<p>There was one particular scene early on in the movie seen in the screenshot below:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.siao2.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/cooter.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="240" /></p>
<p>The scene, a conversation on the golf course between caddy Danny Noonan (Michael O'Keefe) and rich eccentric Ty Webb.(Chevy Chase) goes roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Danny: Did you have to take that Kuder Preference Test when you were a senior?</p>
<p>Ty: Oh yeah, I took it. They said I should be a fire watcher. What are you supposed to be?</p>
<p>Danny: An underachiever.</p>
<p>Now the test in question (which in my high school was administered to the junior class, was actually the Kuder Preference Test, not Cooter (which is more likely from informal Google searches really either talking about the movie itself or a particular species of turtle).</p>
<p>I remember calling and asking the Kuger folks who administer many different types of tests about it years later, with the answer given as:</p>
<p>• yes, it is a satirical allusion to a test of ours, but</p>
<p>• the test itself would never give either of those responses io anyone taking it, so</p>
<p>• in the end, it was better to leave it alone and not try to force any kind of change.</p>
<p>In its own way, captions might even improve the situation because it makes the fact that it is satire more obvious. But either way, it's funny. And every script or transcript or captions file or movie copy on cable spelled it the same way.</p>
<p>,Or maybe someone really likes turtles? ;-)</p>

<p>It was way back in April of 2011 that I first blogged about chained dead keys and how you could alter a .KLC file to make them work in <strong><a href="../../../2011/04/16/10154700.html" target="_blank">Chain chain chain, chain of dead keys</a></strong>.</p>
<p>And then later that same year in November of 2011 that I described how I created an awesome layout the hard way in <strong><a href="../../../2011/11/09/10235391.html" target="_blank">Behind the Phonetic Cherokee layout in Windows 8</a></strong>, using information such as graphics like this:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.siao2.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/cherokeephonetic.jpg" alt="" width="275" height="357" /></p>
<p>They were amazed about the potential but not as enthusiastic about being able to convince everyone to be able to upgrade to Windows 8 to be able to even try it out. They frankly asked if they could get a downloadable package that included it, or at least a.KLC file that they could load to build the package themselves.</p>
<p>I said that I would try.</p>
<p>Then with the non-adoption by so many to Windows 8 and then later to Windows 8.1, the question became more urgent.</p>
<p>But that approval never came.</p>
<p>Now that April 2011 blog post makes it clear how hard it would be to ask others to download the source file and then build such a package, but there was no swaying the PTB (Powers That Be) at Microsoft to do it for them.</p>
<p>It was like Vista all over again, what with cool international support on a less compelling platform.</p>
<p>Even if it was me doing the actual work (from my point of view, it was less work than the full update I was pining for, after all!).</p>
<p>Even now, they have not given the approval. An approval that I would be willing to do my best to work on even while out on disability.</p>
<p>It's really supposed to be about delighting the customer, after all. So on behalf of myself, I'd like to apologize to Roy, Joseph, Jeff, Tracy, everyone in EBCI, and everyone in Cherokee Nation....</p>

Something I am tinkering with, since the layout needs lowercase characters now.</div>

<p>I remember my second last aka penultimate Comic-Con, the Seattle area Emerald City Comic-Con in March of 2010, and I get wistful.</p>
<p>Not wistful about the fact that Leonard Nimoy was there, although he was obviously quite popular to folks. He is not here anymore.</p>
<p>And not wistful about the attention that I was attracting with my iBOT 4000, and how much fun it was to creatively answer questions about it. Obviously, it's not here anymore either.</p>
<p>Next to where folks lined up to get autographs from Nimoy, was the person that I wanted to see. The one before Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Veronica Mars. My first image of a strong female character.</p>
<p>Colonel Wilma Deering, played by Erin Gray. I wasn't looking for her autograph; I just wanted to thank her for being a good strong female character who could order around and outshoot pretty much all of the other characters, male and female.
<p style="text-align: left;">I don't think that she really remembers:me, the geek who looked cool sitting atop $26,100 of Microsoft's money in a wheelchair like the iBOT. But I will always remember her, whether in an episode of the show like The Crystals:</p>

Or a picture someone took of her at that ECCC:</p>

<p>Or in a stock photo of her in her flight suit:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.siao2.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/eringray.jpg" alt="" width="303" height="400" /></p>
<p>I probably won't be back at a comic-con now that I am sans iBOT. But I will never forget that penultimate visit to ECCC....</p>

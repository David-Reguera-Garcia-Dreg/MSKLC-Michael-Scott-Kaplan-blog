<p>It reminds me of my former <a href="../../../2008/03/13/8170697.html" target="_blank">Another face to irony</a> blog, inspired by friend Heather Hamilton....</p>
<p>There are three kinds of irony in the literary sense (replace 'I' below with 'the hero' since the literary hero on this Blog is literally I, by which I mean me:</p>
<p>• Dramatic irony: when everyone knows something that I do not;</p>
<p>• Situational irony: when something happens but I was expecting the opposite to occur;</p>
<p>• Verbal irony: when I am saying one (of two) things but in actuality meaning the other.</p>
<p>Now that is all well and good, but there are now four flavors as well -- the Irony Wines, at<a href="http://www.ironywine.com/" target="_blank"> http://ironywine.com/</a> :</p>

<p>Kind of makes me miss my wine drinking days. Strange that they should be expanding now.</p>
<p>Almost ironic, now that I think about it!</p>

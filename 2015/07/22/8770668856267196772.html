<h1>How soon is... WTF?</h1>

<p>Following the bold inspiration of blog posts like <strong><a href="../../../2007/10/03/5260996.html" target="_blank">How soon was then?</a></strong>Â and <strong><a href="../../../2005/04/18/409125.html" target="_blank">How soon is now?</a></strong>, both of which are meant to allude to the song by The Smiths and covered by Love Spit Love titled How Soon Is Now? which is itself inspired by <strong>George Eliot</strong> (alias of <strong>Mary Ann Evans</strong>) and a small piece of her seminal work Middlemarch, I was particularly unhappy about the way that the song itself was butchered beyond recognition by the television series Charmed (especially as seen on reruns on the basic cable network TNT).</p>

<p>Well over the past few weeks, TNT has topped their previous song shaming at least 33% of time by replacing the lines</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I am the son</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">and the heir</span></p>
<p>with the lines</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I am the sun</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">and the air</span></p>
<p>and I was dumbfounded about how to react exactly.</p>
<p>For example, it was in the 7:00am rerun yesterday, but not the 6:00am or 8:00am.</p>
<p>WTF? By which I mean What The F**k ? By which I mean THE FUCK?</p>
<p>But then I stopped and wondered whether the TNT rerun had managed to (accidentally?) backformation its way into topical relevance for the supernatural show's theme song.</p>
<p>I doubt that it has ever been intentional, but as changes go it is kinda really cool as a form of redemption for the [formerly?] butchered theme song for the show's beginning title credits.</p>
<p>Maybe I am the only one with captions on who even noticed how it has been selectively happening....;-)</p>

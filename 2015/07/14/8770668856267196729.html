<p>If you search this Blog with the keywords <strong><a href="http://www.siao2.com/?s=keyboards+hardware+vs+software" target="_blank">keyboards hardware vs software</a></strong> to see the many differences between these two things that are supposed to be kinda the same but the recent blog post about the Chinese keyboard</p>

<p>puts it all into perspective for me. Several have suggested that the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cangjie_input_method" target="_blank">Cangjie input method</a></strong> is what it seems to resemble most closely.</p>
<p>It is easy to see how far Windows has moved away from this dedicated hardware model with its IMEs in the Text Services Framework that I doubt that the Cangjie TSF Text Input Profile could ever hope to connect to seamlessly.</p>
<p>How far has Windows and Microsoft moved away from this input model exactly? Pretty far, I would imagine!</p>

<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.siao2.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/dreamworld5.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" />It's always fun to watch Nathan Fillion aka Captain Malcolm Reynolds of Firefly's Serenity aka writer Richard Castle, seen 3-4 times a day in reruns on TNT. In a great example of forensic typography for the masses reminiscent of blog posts like <strong><a href="../../../2007/08/22/4519235.html" target="_blank">İ şéè đêäđ ķéÿš</a></strong>. The second episode of the sixth season titled Dreamworld has our author hero proving himself superior to his Feds counterparts by revealing the content of redacted documents by taking advantage of letter width differences in various words as a kind of typographic signature in a proportional font like Times Roman.</p>

<p>Fun? Yes. Validating? Maybe. It's just nice to see things that I have been blogging about for years kinda shown to everyone....</p>

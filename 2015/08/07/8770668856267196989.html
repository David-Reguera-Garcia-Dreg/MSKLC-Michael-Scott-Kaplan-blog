<p>Friend and colleague from my Unicode days Doug Ewell wrote to me via email:
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Michael,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Below is the latest salvo in an ongoing battle on the Unicode public list.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Does any version of Windows, from 3.1 to 10, support keyboard drivers
with ligatures of more than four UTF-16 code points?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">If so, where is this documented?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Thanks,</p>

Now to be perfectly honest, I would have told almost anyone elseÂ to justÂ Â get bent, assuming I bothered to respond at all and this is what the lawyers would object since the question is so very asked and answeredÂ . But I have known Doug for a long time, and I know he is one of the good guys, fighting the good fight.</p>
<p>So I decided to answer it in a blog post, the very next day. Here goes..</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.siao2.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/hhk.jpg" alt="The Happy Hacking Keyboard makes for a great metaphor..." width="500" height="196" /></p>
<p>Short answer NO. Rude answer HELL NO. ExplanationsÂ <a href="../../../2006/03/24/559169.html" target="_blank">here</a>, which references <a href="../../../2005/04/07/406060.html" target="_blank">here</a>. <strong>More insight into whyÂ follows...</strong>.</p>
<p>A long time ago, a developer colleagueÂ I know and respectÂ who is incidentally still at MicrosoftÂ wrote a header file that defined what a ligature was. He defined it as an sequence of 2-4 arbitrary UTF-16 code points. However, he realized that it was not strictly speaking how a ligature would be defined by a linguist. So he added a // CONSIDER to the code, suggesting the NLS team might need a function that could provide a more appropriate definition.</p>
<p>As it turns out, there was no such function or plans to add one, because it would have been a terrible idea, since neither languages nor keyboards really work that way. Thus, we are spared an even more arbitrary limitation than the one than Doug is talking about here.</p>
<p>But this suggests that perhaps the ceiling could be raised in a future version of Windows.</p>
<p>To this I have a few suggestions as to why this will never ever happen in basic keyboard layouts:</p>
<p>â€¢ there are no more future versions of Windows;</p>
<p>â€¢ even if there were, such a keyboard layout would not be compatible with any prior version of Windows;</p>
<p>â€¢ allowing such a new thing would require significant changes to user32.dll and the console, and likely lead to many regressions throughout Windows, Office, and other companies that depend on the current behavior;</p>
<p>â€¢ Microsoft may have a tendency to be kinda dumb sometimes, but it isn't stupid.</p>
<p>I am therefore reasonably certain that the limitation is not ever going to change, and people should just give up on it happening in regular keyboard layouts.</p>
<p>People who want input methods capable of handling more than four UTF-16 code points really need to look into IMEs (Input Method Editors) which are all now run through TSF (the Text Services Framework), a completely different system of input that allows such things, admittedly at the price of a lot of complexity.</p>
<p>I will now wait a few hours and then send Doug email in case he isn't following the SiaO2 Blog these days.... ;-)</p>

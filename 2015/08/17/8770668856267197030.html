<p>Reader Muzer asked via the Suggestion Box:
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">The formatting seems off on <strong><a href="../../../2005/10/17/481600.html" target="_blank">Comparing Unicode file names the right way</a></strong> and the old one (compare <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130528052217/http://blogs.msdn.com/b/michkap/archive/2005/10/17/481600.aspx" target="_blank"><strong>here</strong></a>)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Not sure how much you can do about this, but thought I’d attempt to report it in a vaguely reasonable place.</p>
Fun to see my old Cerebus the Aardvark Blog mascot again!</p>

<p>Well, looking at the one blog post on SiaO2.com and the original blog post on the Internet Archive, Muzer has a good point. The new site doesn't really handle the width of the post very well.</p>
<p>It kinda sucks that what looks good in one Blog might not look as good as in the other, especially if an individual blog post has specific requirements such as this one (where the requirement in this particular case can be interpreted as WIDE LOAD!), I wouldn't want to penalize a blog post from 2005 as being too fat....</p>
<p>That would almost seem like bullying. In this case, it's not anyone's fault in particular, not even Microsoft's. But they could have kept the old Blog up and decided when it was no longer part of  the plan or whatever.</p>
<p>At least The Internet Archive is around so you can see it way my former managers over the intervening years intended it... ;-)</p>
<p>No use crying over spilled milk. Maybe I will add that same  link to the new blog post too -- to point out how to see it properly, to  make it more accessible. Not all readers are as dedicated as he was!</p>

Sorry, I've just been rereading your blog from the beginning since I discovered it had been put back online here!

Your lists were formatted as tables, as they are here, but for whatever reason (I don't understand newfangled CSS/web stuff) the blog's formatting is overriding your specifications of font colour/table padding/etc. - compare with web.archive.org/web/20130721145705/http://blogs.msdn.com/b/michkap/archive/2004/12/08/278170.aspx</div>

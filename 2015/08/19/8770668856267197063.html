<p>Watching the whole Ashley Madison data hacking scandal is an open invitation to have everyone drown in a swamp of moral ambiguity.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.siao2.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ashleymadison.jpg" alt="" width="273" height="185" /></p>
<p>Now I am seriously not judging here. I have had lapses over the years. But I mean who do you root for in a battle between these kinds are sides?</p>
<p>• the website promising discrete infidelity who gets a registered trademark for their catchy slogan as if they ever had a chance at winning in a civil suit for anyone misusing their catchphrase? or</p>
<p>• the lowlife bottom feeders who prove me wrong and try to take advantage of Ashley Madison business model? or</p>
<p>• the hackers who "liberated" the names of the cheating clients from the site who started publishing them when the site owners wouldn't cave to blackmail? or</p>
<p>• the Twitter trend that makes the passing away of the actor who played TV's Batgirl consigned to ALSO DEAD status? or</p>
<p>• the data miners who look for awful patterns like the number of.mil or .gov email addresses or politicians or celebrities? or</p>
<p>• the identity thieves who have found a sociopathically  novel way to "launder" identity theft through something as truly unclean as institutional infidelity?</p>
<p>I could try to go on but I threw up in my mouth a little typing this list. I shudder at any jury that would have to decide who is most guilty in a situation where almost everyone is in the wrong and nobody is going to come out unscathed. Just touching it is like catching a bit of plague.</p>
<p>How could we sink any lower than the crimes against dignity that this will cause? :/</p>
<p>I am usually quite the cynical bastard but THIS is causing the stack to overflow.</p>
<p>I'd like to go wash my hands now -- my phone from which I am authoring this blog post autofilled Madison after I typed Ashley....</p>

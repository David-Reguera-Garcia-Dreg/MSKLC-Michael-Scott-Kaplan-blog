<h1>You ever think about 'the sleep number bed' from the point of view of an engineer?</h1>

<p>In my heart, I am an engineer.</p>
<p>This affects the way that I look at the entire world, and everything in it.</p>
<p>To be perfectly honest, that doesn't always help me as much as I might like.</p>
<p>I'll give you an example -- you've all heard of the sleep number bed? One simple number to describe the best way to help you sleep. And the bed that can let each member of a couple have their own sleep number setting.</p>
<p>Seems like a great idea, right?</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.siao2.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/snbking.jpg" alt="" width="289" height="174" /></p>
<p>But then that inner engineer starts asking questions.</p>
<p>I mean, not every single bed activity has the same bed firmness requirements. Cuddling, spooning, being left alone, napping, each can have different needs.</p>
<p>Once you add sex to the mix, all bets are off, of course.</p>
<p>I mean, the middle of the bed seems like a terrible place for the act, if the numbers are really different.</p>
<p>Not to mention the fact that whether the decision about which side of the bed to use might depend on who is on top and who is on the bottom, or whether the usual preferred position or dare I say positions comes into play.</p>
<p>Ignore the curse of the longtime serial monogamist such as myself, who would have to crisk the repercussions of broaching this topic of conversation each time.</p>
<p>Sites like http://sleeplikethedead.com/ in general and pages like http://www.sleeplikethedead.com/mattress-sex.html in particular give some insights into a few of these issues, but they really just scratch the surface. In the end, no engineer can be happy with all the shoddy engineering going on here....</p>

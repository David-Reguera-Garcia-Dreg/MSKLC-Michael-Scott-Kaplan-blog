<p>Regular reader, friend, colleague, long time fan of my original Blog, and savior/host of my new reconstituted Blog Jan Kučera was recently able to fix almost every single reported and unreported problem in</p>

<p><strong><a href="../../../2008/11/19/9116067.html" target="_blank">Apocalypse Font (aka Guess they must have picked the wrong eight characters.)</a></strong></p>
<p>turned out be easier than w thought, due to two simple problems being beyond most what was going on:</p>
<p>• the complications of .PNG files in WordPress that many others have found and fixed previously, and</p>
<p>• getting Unicode character support into the underlying MySQL database behind the Blog.</p>
<p>There are a few minor lingering problems like image files hosted in places that no longer exist, but those should be taken care of over the next few weeks as well.</p>
<p>In the meantime, enjoy so much more of the resurrection of the reconstituted Blog!</p>
<p>(and of course *thanks Jan* for making it all possible!!!)</p>

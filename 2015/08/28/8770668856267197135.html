<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">filed under Collation/Casing because if Google can co-opt my passion about  collation with their <strong>Alphabet</strong> re-org, then clearly their passion is the one I've had since before they were born....</span></p>
<p>Years ago it was my PNL (Liz) who asked me:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Who did the work at the beginning of The Rocky Horror Picture Show and provided the lips and voice?</p>
It takes me back to the old days before the Internet or Google made it so much easier to get the answers to questions like that.</p>
<p>The lips for the movie were provided by Patricia Quinn (she played the role of Magenta later in the flick), but she is lip syncing (no pun intended!) the voice provided by Richard O'Brien (the guy who later plays Riff Raff, Magenta's brother).</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.siao2.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/lips.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="883" /></p>
<p>(reference to the blog post <a href="../../../2005/10/14/481095.html" target="_blank">Let there be LIPs</a> implied)</p>
<p>Now I was emotionally prepared for  this issue when SciFi grandmaster Robert A. Heinlein's Double Star taught me how real actors could handle any voice or sound required (which also incidentally explained to me Hugh Laurie's 'American' accent in House MD).</p>
<p>Which is also how I learned that l could never really be an actor myself, by the way....</p>
<p>These days, every Blog in the world has a list of things that you never knew about the Rocky Horror Picture Show that includes random tidbits like these, which can be found by any random Google search. I was much more impressive all those years ago when I did it the old fashioned way.</p>
<p>When I may have known less, but didn't feel like it was being handed to me for free....</p>
<p>Do you know what I mean? ;-)</p>

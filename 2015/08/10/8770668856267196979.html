<h1>What the heck is going on with Microsoft's MSDN GoGlobal site?</h1>

<p>I was just asked a ruder version of this very question the other day on the suggest a topic page. <strong>The Go Global Development Center</strong> is still there as of this morning at 7 am pacific time.</p>
<p>To be perfectly honest, I have no clue whatsoever.</p>
<p>The quick link to the site is still</p>
<p><strong>http://msdn.com/GoGlobal/</strong></p>
<p>since the site first went live and it works just fine. To this day, it is how I find the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/goglobal/bb964651" target="_blank">keyboard layouts page</a>. Although the newest blog post goes as far back three years ago. The site was born on the promise of exciting World-Readiness content and languished on the failure to provide it. Had it been an actual baby, "Failure To Thrive" charges might have been reasonable to pursue.</p>
<p>Other MSDN Development Centers like <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/" target="_blank">the Visual Studio Developer Center</a> that GoGlobal links to have Windows 10 integration advice.</p>
<p>The link to the Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator is there and it is listed as a Top Download, although searching from that site on terms like MSKLC Windows 8 leads to nothing but speculation about whether it works from customers. And the same kind of search on MSKLC Windows 10 goes nowhere at all. The Microsoft Locale Builder seems to be conspicuously absent as well.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><a style="color: #ff6600;" href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/download/details.aspx?id=41158" target="_blank">Locale Builder 2.0 </a>was released officially in 2013 and only supports Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2,, and apparently= only supports creating locales for those two versions and seldom mentioned Windows RT 8.1. This gem is not mentioned on the site as a download of any kind. I will just  say backup WTF? parenthetically and leave it there. Although curious, I didn't install the thing, because to be frank it scares the hell out of me. Shawn blogged about <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/shawnste/archive/2013/11/18/locale-builder-v2-0-for-windows-8-1-server-2012-r2-released.aspx" target="_blank">here </a>back in November 2013 but that blob was not picked  up by GoGloal.</span></p>
<p>The link on the top of the Additional Resources on the side has Keyboard Layouts but they have not been updated since Windows 7, even though lotsa keyboards have.</p>
<p>EAI (Email Address Internationalization) isn't even on the page anywhere. And the top of the Featured Resources in the middle of the page is a Channel 9 video about Windows Forms Localization and Localizability. Former Softie Kieran Snyder's Extended Linguistic Services site has its link intact.</p>
<p>One senses the Internet equivalent of cobwebs on the page. :(</p>
<p>At least the link to the Microsoft Typography site is still there....</p>

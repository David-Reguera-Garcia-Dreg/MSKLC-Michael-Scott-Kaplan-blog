<h1>Ā was unexpected at this time (MS-DOS Mobile edition)</h1>

<p>So the folks working on the Nokia Lumia decided to have some fun on April First and they released a video about their exciting new release: MS-DOS Mobile Edition....</p>
<p>Great April Fools Day prank!</p>
<p>It didn't take long for people to realize that it didn't do very much, but people nevertheless had fun describing all of the kinda hidden tricks.</p>
<p>As far as I could tell, nobody described the coolest feature, one that reminded me of a bug from years ago....</p>
<p>Mark Zbikowski and the old lexer/parser bug that I blogged about years ago:</p>
<p><a title="Ā was unexpected at this time." href="../../../2006/01/30/519760.html" target="_blank">Ā was unexpected at this time</a>.</p>
<p>Or you can go to the Internet Archive to see the art:</p>
<p><a title="Ā was unexpected at this time." href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121004022241/http://blogs.msdn.com/b/michkap/archive/2006/01/30/519760.aspx" target="_blank">Ā was unexpected at this time.</a></p>
<p>The feature was something I found when seeing if the old bug fixed by Zibo stayed fixed. I simply added a keyboard layout that had LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH MACRON (Ā) aka U+0100 on it (I used Latvian!), and just typed</p>
<p>echo Ā</p>
<p>into MS-DOS Mobile Edition, and I found two things:</p>
<p>1) the bug did not repro, either in the original form or the lame way that other Windows Phone consoles did where it displayed Ā but would not echo it back.</p>
<p>2) after testing with a dozen different keyboard layouts including Thai, Lao, and Bengali, I found that any Unicode character could be typed, displayed, and echo'd properly!</p>
<p>Pretty cool hidden Easter egg from my colleagues over at Nokia. Now if they would just release the source so developers could do it too!</p>

<h1>Why the 'Blogs I Read' list no longer exists on SiaO2.com</h1>

<p>So the other day, someone got a hold of me and asked me a question:</p>
<p>"Why does your new, reconstituted Blog no longer have a list of Blogs you read?"</p>
<p>Good question.</p>
<p>Interestingly, it took her a while to figure out how to get in touch with me, but apparently all it really required was a little persistence. The way she described the job made me feel a little like George Peppard of The A-Team (gratuitous Wikimedia pic added for no good reason whatsoever)</p>

<p>You must remember the inspiring intro:
<blockquote>In 1972, a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court for a crime they didn't commit. These men promptly escaped from a maximum security stockade to the Los Angeles underground. Today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune. If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them, maybe you can hire the A-Team.</p>
<p>â€”John Ashley's opening narration</blockquote>
Okay, enough of that....</p>
<p>There are three reasons that the list of Blogs I read is gone; one is the universe's fault, one is Facebook's, and the other is Microsoft's.</p>
<p>1) The universe can be blamed for my current health situation, which at this point has me on long term disability. I simply don't have the kind of time I used to have.</p>
<p>2) Facebook can be blamed for whatever petty issues they have with my (previously blogged about) unLIKEing campaign caused them to (unintentionally?) break simple functionality like their own smartlists that has proven to be kinda distracting.</p>
<p>3) Microsoft can be blamed for (unintentionally?) corrupting my Microsoft ID by the way they took my original Blog down so fully that I can't even *read* a blogs.msdn.com Blog unless I do it anonymously.</p>
<p>I doubt that I could ever imagine the fault being put on the former manager who had the original Blog taken down, the person from HR supporting the decision, or the vendor who did the takedown, because I really doubt that any of them are vicious enough or ignorant enough to do it intentionally. They simply see no upside to fixing the problem, as far as I can tell.</p>
<p>Who can blame them? This may make me look bitter and petty, but it makes them look like bullies who pick on sick people. And even a cynical M.O.T. atheist can enjoy having the moral high ground!</p>

<p>I was thinking about Walter Dandy once again.</p>
<p>Just like I do once a year on this day.</p>
<p>April 6th, I mean.</p>
<p>The first time I blogged about him was on April 6th, 2006.</p>
<p>The blog post was Dandy of Johns Hopkins:</p>

<p>ThereÂ is absolutely no way to explain why I regret that I never had the chance to pursue neurological surgery as a career, beyond the "watching as close as I possibly could" way that an EEG/EP tech might manage.</p>
<p>It just wasn't in the cards.</p>
<p>But I'll never be able to forget Walter Dandy the famous neurosurgeon who inspired me to strive so very long ago.</p>
<p><i>for Sherry Apple my long lost friend and favorite neurosurgeon...</i></p>

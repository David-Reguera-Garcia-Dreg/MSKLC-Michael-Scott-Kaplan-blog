<h1>Microsoft can really be a bully, sometimes</h1>

<p>It is seldom due to any kind of malicious intent on the part of anyone there, mind you. In fact, most of the bullying can be divided into two simple categories, each of which has recently been shown by recent example here.</p>
<p>The first category is simple incompetence, such as shown in the following blog post:</p>
<p><a title="Being slapped by thee hand that feeds you at Microsoft" href="../../03/13/8770668856267196332.html" target="_blank">Being slapped by the hand that feeds you [or at least 60% of you] at Microsoft </a></p>
<p>As that one indicates, simple lack of interest in being good people leads to bullying an employee out on disability followed by a willingness to bribe the employee in question to convince them to drop the issue.</p>
<p>The second category is outrageous stupidity, as shown in the following blog post:</p>
<p><a title="Fractions may be your friend, but they can trip up Microsoft!" href="../../../2014/11/04/8770668856267196244.html" target="_blank">Fractions may be your friend, but they can trip up Microsoft!</a></p>
<p>Believe it or not, Microsoft Corp has now taken it upon themselves to send the amount of the three day overpayment that is ENTIRELY the fault of their very own payroll system to a collection agency, so that while I am out on disability trying to recover they can recoup the cost of their own mistake.</p>
<p>Technically both categories count as either professional or personal incompetence, but this second category is so batshit stupid on *their* part that I really think that they should cut their losses and stop embarrassing themselves.</p>
<p>If you know what I mean.</p>
<p>It makes me miss the days when Google was so embarrassed about not reimbursing me for some of my interviewing expenses that they pretty much wrote a blank check without even asking me to resubmit my receipts.</p>
<p>I guess Google is doing better than Microsoft these days.</p>

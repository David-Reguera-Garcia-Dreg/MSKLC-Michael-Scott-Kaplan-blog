<h1>Broadcasting closed captions with a passive vocabulary</h1>

<p><em>Loving the linguistically ambiguous title, by the way...</em></p>
<p>I was watching <strong>The Devil Wears Prada</strong> yesterday on HBO East.</p>
<p>And then I was so shocked that I watched it again on HBO West.</p>
<p>In between I watched several legitimate and less than legitimate copies to make sure that I wasn't going crazy, looking for this and other differences. For example, some versions included dong lyrics and some did not.</p>
<p>Now I guess at some level I realized that even the legal studio copies had more one version of .SRT files. How else to add commentary from various actors and directors and such.</p>
<p>However, I wasn't expecting an example of passive vocabulary, due to one or more of the following causes:</p>
<p>• different versions of SUBRIP (the most common technology behind .SRT files);</p>
<p>• more sophisticated programs doing the job;</p>
<p>• better manual editing of the .SRT files to avoid embarrassing errors in the movie's areas of expertise (in this case, fashion and fashion figures).</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, that is what I found.</p>
<p>Here follows a brief excerpt of the movie's .SRT file with the HBO error manually inserted:
<blockquote>630
00:43:46,832 --&gt; 00:43:50,002
Call James Holt's office. Tell them
I wanna move the preview up.</p>
<p>631
00:43:50,169 --&gt; 00:43:54,089
Today at 12:30. Tell everybody else.
Be ready to leave in half an hour.</p>
<p>632
00:43:54,757 --&gt; 00:43:56,842
But we're not expected
until Tuesday.</p>
<p>633
00:43:57,051 --&gt; 00:43:59,386
- Did she say why?
- Yes. She explained...</p>
<p>634
00:43:59,553 --&gt; 00:44:03,224
...every detail of her decision-making.
Then we brushed each other's hair...</p>
<p>635
00:44:03,390 --&gt; 00:44:06,393
...and gabbed about American Idol.
- I see your point.</p>
<p>636
00:44:06,560 --&gt; 00:44:09,146
- What's a preview, anyway?
- Good morning, Miranda.</p>
<p>637
00:44:09,355 --&gt; 00:44:13,526
Miranda insists on seeing the designer's
collections before they show them.</p>
<p>638
00:44:13,734 --&gt; 00:44:15,361
- Great to see you again.
- Hello.</p>
<p>639
00:44:15,694 --&gt; 00:44:18,447
- And she tells them what she thinks?
- In her way.</p>
<p>640
00:44:18,656 --&gt; 00:44:22,034
This season really began for me
with a meditation...</p>
<p>641
00:44:22,243 --&gt; 00:44:24,787
...on the intersection
between East and West.</p>
<p>642
00:44:24,995 --&gt; 00:44:28,374
There's a scale. One nod is good.
Two nods, very good.</p>
<p>643
00:44:28,958 --&gt; 00:44:32,628
There's only been one actual smile on
record, and that was Tom Vordin 2001.</blockquote>
Can you spot the error? It jumped right out at me as I was casually watching the movie....</p>
<p>Now I am pretty sure that HBO is not the guilty party but for the sake of the film's artistic integrity it would better if it were HBO's fault.</p>

<h1>Only Microsoft could snatch defeat out of the jaws of victory that way....</h1>

<p>Years ago, Peter Weller and Sam Elliott starred in a film named <strong>Shakedown</strong> (also known as <strong>Blue Jean Cop</strong>, based on a plot point on a way to describe a particular type of corrupt police officer).</p>
<p>In a key scene, Antonio Fargas (playing drug kingpin Nicky Carr) is very annoyed when aspiring corrupt police officer Larry Joshua (playing Detective Rydel) interrupts an illegal drag race before it even starts, with the dismissive comment: "Rydel, you could f**k up a wet dream!"</p>
<p>Now I could act all superior and point to my blog post from 2006 entitled Intended Implicatures    (<a href="../../../2006/09/24/768343.html">http://www.siao2.com/2006/09/24/768343.aspx</a>) that was pointing out that as far back as Microsoft Access in 1992 and in versions of Microsoft Windows as far back as Vista with its WGA (Windows Genuine Advantage) program, that Microsoft has been on the wrong side of a serious philosophical <strong>guilty until proven innocent</strong> issue, and just say I told you so. I could even point out the specific Product Unit Managers, General Managers, and even Vice Presidents whom I specifically met with and always had them agree with me while admitting that others had been making the same point previously.</p>
<p>It makes the whole thing pointed out in Microsoft's obsession with piracy threatens to create a Windows 10 licensing mess    (<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/will-microsoft-piracy-obsession-create-a-windows-10-licensing-mess/">http://www.zdnet.com/article/will-microsoft-piracy-obsession-create-a-windows-10-licensing-mess/</a>) kind of anticlimactic, even ignoring the fact that ZDNet has a scosh more people than either version of my Blog.</p>
<p>Only Microsoft could snatch defeat out of the jaws of victory that way, if you know what I mean....</p>

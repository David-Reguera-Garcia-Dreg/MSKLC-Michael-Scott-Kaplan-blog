<h1>Never mind that other trigeminal neuralgia post....</h1>

<p>I know I promised another blog about Trigeminal Neuralgia, contrasting the two experiences split by two decades, but I've had a change of heart about writing it.</p>
<p>For the most part, it would be little more than a simple contrast of the march of technology of the anesthetic used (Brevital vs. Propofol) and the personnel (the now retired Dr. Charles E. Poletti and the now deceased then resident Dr. Sherry Apple vs. the UWMC neurosurgeon I found here) to perform the Sweet/Wespic percutaneous radiofrequency rhizotomy.</p>
<p>Since both differences are beyond my control, it seems pointless to go into the differences, really.</p>
<p>The only remaining point to possibly discuss would be the periodic oscillation between whether or not the neurosurgery is recommended, but that is mainly an issue of whether the outpatient procedure is in fashion, a fact that I simply chose to ignore since I knew that I needed it.</p>
<p>Beyond that, if anyone wants to remember the amazing neurosurgeon Sherry Apple, MD, I suppose that they could maybe do so here.</p>
<p><em>I miss you, Sherry!</em></p>

<p>As I first mentioned back in blog posts like <a href="../../../2014/03/02/390439114827275780.html" target="_blank">Audibleâ€™s badge model is fascinating to me....</a>Â the whole Audible badge model has always fascinated me..</p>
<p>Well, it is safe to say that I am over it now.</p>
<p>After seeing how Amazon and Audible don't bother to keep track of the Badges or Achievements between platforms or devices or even between some upgrades/updates on a single device, it's clear that there is no sincere corporate interest in maintaining the charade even if it really wouldn't cost them very much to do so in the long run.</p>
<p>And so, in the spirit of huge companies that can simultaneously seem to care and fail to give a crap, here follows my rant....</p>
<p>Contrast with how much they care about keeping track of actual purchases of books ðŸ“š and it's obvious that they don't mind making the illusion of Badges and Achievements a distant priority.</p>
<p>Not that I have any plans to stop reading any time soon, mind you, which may be why Amazon wouldn't actually care in the long run.</p>
<p>However, with my multiple sclerosis induced simple partial seizures causing occasional time loss and confusion, the feature of allowing Audible to "Sleep" unless periodically awakened becomes an interesting way to keep from losing track of what I am reading while I am actually reading it, if you know what I mean.</p>
<p>It helps me keep my Time Loss issue under control, in fact.</p>
<p>How kind of them! ;-) (sarcasm kindaÂ implied....)</p>

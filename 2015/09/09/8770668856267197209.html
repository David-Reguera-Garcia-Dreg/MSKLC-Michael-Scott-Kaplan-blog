<h1>More sustainable translation in movies, like in 'Sushi - The Global Catch'</h1>

<p>It starts with a movie with an agenda, something common on Pivot.TV.</p>
<p>Sushi - The Global Catch</p>
<p>Now I am or at least used to be much more about the Saki than the sushi or sashimi.</p>
<p>You can think of it as an exercise in forensic localization, trying to determine the intended source and target languages.</p>
<p>It is easy in cases like this:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.siao2.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Sushi-the-Global-Catch.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="240" /></p>
<p>But it is much more complicated in other cases.</p>
<p>It seriously contrasts embedded subtitles like in Japanese and Polish versus captions like in Australian English, Californian English, Canadian English, and Texan English.</p>
<p>The easiest way to see the difference is to look at the Japanese people speaking English for JAL vs. Japanese people speaking English otherwise.</p>
<p>Clearly they are contrasting what they think are mutually intelligible language speakers.</p>
<p>Now speaking personally, I find having them both turned on to be pretty distracting, but I think many people might find it easy to understand, especially if it is what they are used to seeing.</p>
<p>The movie will be on Pivot.TV once again tonight for those who may be interested....</p>

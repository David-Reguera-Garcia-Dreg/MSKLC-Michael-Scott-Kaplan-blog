<p>My relationship with Michelle Sinclair, formerly known as adult star Belladonna, was an interesting one. It really consisted of her finding interesting poses for pictures that we would take interesting, titillating portraits of. I admit that the pictures were all pretty much her creative ideas, although I found them to be a lot of fun. And each one topped the previous one for how wild it was.</p>

<p>The final pose she wanted to make was essentially a 69 where I was sitting in my iBOT 4000 upright and she was going to be upside down facing me. I didn't let her do that particular pose because I was worried about her getting kicked out of the Adult Entertainment Expo for that particular pose so I suggested a tamer one instead....</p>

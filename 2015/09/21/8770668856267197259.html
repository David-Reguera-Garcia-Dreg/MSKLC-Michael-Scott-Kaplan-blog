<p>Have you ever been in a motor vehicle accident where you realized what was going to happen when it was too late to do anything about it except watch the situation unfold messily in front of you?</p>
<p>If your answer to this question is YES, them you know a lot about this last year for me....</p>
<p>I have been out on disability since the end of March 2014, but some time after I was out on disability I was made part of a RIF (Reduction In Force) for Microsoft. Unfortunately for both of us, a lot of the internal tools dealing with stock vesting rules, payroll, health insurance, life insurance, vacation time, and domestic partner data are not properly equipped for dealing with this [apparently?] uncommon scenario that I suppose was never properly tested.</p>
<p>Perhaps they should have given me an extra bonus for testing a scenario they didn't have proper coverage of? ;-)</p>
<p>Anyhow, three weeks before the official separation associated with the RIF, I get email informing me that my next stock vesting will happen in six weeks. Hmmm....</p>
<p>One silver lining in all of this is they actually paid off all of my stock, both about to be vested and completely unvested. But that was something that actually surprised them.</p>
<p>The other good thing that happened is that the problem with my Microsoft ID that they broke when they turned off my old Blog on blogs.msdn.com that also made all Blogs on that site inaccessible to me reversed itself after the formal separation, bur since that was supposed to not be happening anyway, I guess that was another happy accident too.</p>
<p>Unfortunately my Windows 10 upgrade eligibility was lost that day as well, but I have been assured that it couldn't possibly be happening, so it must not be, actually. Even though it is.</p>
<p>Similarly, that separation day had yet another consequence, not unlike the Windows 10 instant nonuprgadability. On that same day, my Microsoft Office 15 installation spontaneously found itself having subscription problems. I have been assured by Microsoft support that there is no way that this is possible, or that if it is happening that it is not intentional, and that if it is intentional then it not technically licensed anyway.</p>
<p>At this point I gave up on getting any answers from Microsoft support. The contortions of the non explanation of an explanation kinda proved themselves their own sort of logic. Microsoft style logic, but I guess I can spend a couple of licenses to revalidate what my formal separation has [apparently?]Â invalidated.</p>
<p>Oh well. And le sigh....</p>

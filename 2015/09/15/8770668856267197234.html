<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Feel free as with the blog post <a href="../14/8770668856267197219.html" target="_blank">yesterday </a>to ignore all or part of this blog post which is entirely off topic by any reasonable standard....</em></span></p>
<p>Fast forward a few years, and I was now working as president of Trigeminal Software and aa a contract developer for Microsoft. The year was 1999 and I was making a great living doing Y2K reviews/repairs for companies other than Microsoft and many of the Microsoft contracts that I blogged about <a href="../../08/26/8770668856267197111.html" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="../../08/27/8770668856267197121.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Then I decided that having a grown up job really ought to go along with grown up things like a corporate logo and a slightly more impressive website than the one that I had up that was authored in Notepad.</p>
<p>I hired a designer to do both and she did an excellent job that I was quite pleased with and I asked her if she wanted to be my webmaster and take formal named credit for the work and such.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I should mention at this point that we hadn't even met in person.</span></p>
<p>She stopped me, admitted that she had previously worked as an adult film star, and expressed concerned that her past might affect my company's reputation or Microsoft's.</p>
<p>She obviously didn't understand how the geek subculture worked.  ;-)</p>
<p>But we compromised by having her take the job as my <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Webmistress</strong> </span>and she even created a small avatar for the site while she held the job:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.siao2.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/thewebmistress.jpg" alt="" width="50" height="81" /></p>
<p>She also gave me the cool binary geek background image:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.siao2.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/11010100.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="36" /></p>
<p>or the version of the logo with the pronunciation (confusion about <strong>that</strong> has always been a problem for non medical clients, <em>including</em> Microsoft):</p>
<p><del><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.siao2.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/trigem-logo2.jpg" alt="" width="281" height="71" /></del></p>
<p>Eventually we met and shortly afterwards started dating/having a kinda romantic relationship. Once again I was exposed to an entirely different viewpoint of the world that I found utterly fascinating, and I also learned how unrealistic sex actually is in an adult film -- not just for people outside the industry (which I already knew myself from my own experience!)  but for people inside it as well.</p>
<p>I recently blogged about this relationship <a href="../../08/31/8770668856267197149.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>A small number of people at Microsoft knew about it and about the autographed movie poster hanging on the wall in my office there. I don't think most people even realized it.... ;-)</p>
<p>I am not including the poster here because her name and likeness is nobody else's business!</p>
<p>Additionally, a speaking gig in Amsterdam for SDGN (Software Development Group Netherlands) where a few of my colleagues wanted to search for a copy of one of her movies, which I adamantly refused to watch on principle even if we did find it (thankfully, we didn't).</p>
<p>Eventually, we parted ways and for a short while I wouldn't need to travel to southern California quite so regularly, though I got past that eventually (a topic for another blog post on another day!).</p>

<p><strong>What are the languages of India?</strong> is a rather loaded question. </p>
<p>Not in the <strong>Have you stopped beating your wife yet?</strong> sense. But perhaps to some the two questions&nbsp;have a similar order of magnitude.</p>
<p>In&nbsp;the constitution of India, it is clear that the official languages of the country are Hindi (in the Devanagari script)&nbsp;and English&nbsp;(in the Latin script).&nbsp;</p>
<p>But&nbsp;a part of the constitution allows the recognition of official languages in individual states, and since the states had their borders largely decided based on language it seemed best to leave it to the states to work to define the official languages within the states.</p>
<p>With that said, there is a list of languages that have a special significance, whose latest incarnation is described <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_languages_of_India#The_languages_of_the_Eighth_Schedule_to_the_Constitution">here</a>&nbsp;in Wikipedia:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">The Eighth Schedule to the Indian Constitution contains a list of 22 scheduled languages. At the&nbsp;time the constitution was enacted, inclusion in this list meant that the language was entitled to representation on the Official Languages Commission, and that the language would be one of the bases that would be drawn upon to enrich Hindi, the official language of the Union. The list has since, however, acquired further significance. The Government of India is now under an obligation to take measures for the development of these languages, such that "they grow rapidly in richness and become effective means of communicating modern knowledge." In addition, a candidate appearing in an examination conducted for public service at a higher level is entitled to use any of these languages as the medium in which he answers the paper.</span></p>
<p>There are obviously benefits to being on this rather exclusive&nbsp;list -- this number <strong>22</strong>&nbsp;is out of either nearly 500 or over 1500 languages in India&nbsp;(depending on whose count you accept).</p>
<p>The list (table modified from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_India#Official_languages">here</a>) in order of population is:</p>

<p>&nbsp;Now I threw that third column in to point out that not every decision made in regard to Windows has a pure population reason behind it. I could have used other list items like version of Windows where support was added if I wanted to show even more interesting and/or strange trends, but&nbsp;I figure this one is enough for present purposes.</p>
<p>Now of all of these languages the only one that cannot be displayed at all using the built in fonts in Windows 7 is Santali, which is written with the Ol Chiki script. But I was told that literacy rates among speakers is low, so perhaps that 6.5 million number shouldn't be thought of purely in terms of "theoretical potential customers". Though of course other numbers would change on this list as well, with that metric. :-)</p>
<p>Microsoft Windows and Office don't seem all that well aimed at the "silent majority" (~93%) in India who don't speak English, but we'll leave that interesting issue for another day....</p>
<p>There are only&nbsp;a few&nbsp;real anomalies on this list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kashmiri, whose font support is available for both the Arabic script&nbsp;and the Devanagari script, would really have to wait for built-in&nbsp;locale support until after the political situation is resolved in a less tense way;</li>
<li>Sanskrit having a locale is obviously also a very political thing, in the other direction;</li>
<li>Sindhi mostly uses the Devanagari script in India and has had those extra needed characters added both to Unicode and in Microsoft fonts, a small point of embarrassment for me personally (and for Microsoft) since the inclusion of the characters in Unicode when the relevant version of ISO/IEC 10646 had not yet added them making them out of sync for a version was done on the basis of Microsoft requesting them (through the people in the UTC meeting at the time, which included me) for the sake of support in the next version of Windows and Office (though the locale was never officially added -- either in the Devanagari script for India or the Arabic script for Pakistan);</li>
</ul>
<p>And the most unusual of the anomalies on this list? It can be seen&nbsp;in <strong>Urdu</strong>, which as I mentioned in <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2010/06/30/10032695.html" title="Giving the people Urdu, we are!"><strong>Giving the people Urdu, we are!</strong></a> can really be thought of as&nbsp;the same underlying language as&nbsp;Hindi, with both of them grown in different directions.</p>
<p>Directions that have helped to fuel the differences between india and Pakistanfor lo these many years, in fact.</p>
<p>Yet in Windows, where an <strong>Urdu - Pakistan</strong> locale exists, no <strong>Urdu - India</strong> one is to found!</p>
<p>Though space has been reserved for it, as charts in both <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/goglobal/bb964664.aspx">Locale IDs Assigned by Microsoft</a> and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd318693.aspx">Language Identifier Constants and Strings</a>&nbsp;indicate (technically the same could be said for <strong>Manipuri - India</strong> and <strong>Nepal - India</strong> and <strong>Sindhi - India</strong>, now that I look at the lists!). I'm not sure whether that counts as transparency or some people publishing the wrong lists!</p>
<p>I was asked by five different people while I was in India&nbsp;about what is holding up an <strong>Urdu - India</strong>&nbsp;, but to be honest I have no earthly clue.&nbsp;I was told&nbsp;that the folks in the subsidiary have asked for it, but I was unable to verify that bit of information at the time this blog was written.</p>
<p>The bulk of the data in the locale would be identical to <strong>Urdu - Pakistan</strong>, but there are incredibly good reasons to really want <strong>Urdu - India</strong> to be separate and not ask people to use "the wrong one".</p>
<p>So, ignoring everything else but the customer requirement for a moment, I am going to use the method described in <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/05/18/601531.html" title="Where are the other Tamils?"><strong>Where are the other Tamils?</strong></a> and create a custom locale for <strong>ur-IN</strong>. :-)</p>
<p>Here is the code:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>using System;<br />using System.Globalization;<br /><br /></strong></span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>namespace CustomLocales {<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; class CustomLocales {<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [STAThread]<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; static void Main() {<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CultureInfo ci = new CultureInfo("ur-PK", false);<br /></strong></span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RegionInfo ri = new RegionInfo("en-IN");<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder carib = new CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder("ur-IN", CultureAndRegionModifiers.None);<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; carib.LoadDataFromCultureInfo(ci);<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; carib.LoadDataFromRegionInfo(ri);<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; carib.CultureEnglishName = "Urdu (India)";<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; carib.CultureNativeName = "اُردو (بھارت)"; // Ignore the way it looks, the string is right! :-)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; carib.CurrencyEnglishName = ri.CurrencyEnglishName;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; carib.CurrencyNativeName = "روپیہ";<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; carib.RegionNativeName = "بھارت";<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; carib.NumberFormat.CurrencySymbol = "Rs.";<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; carib.ThreeLetterWindowsLanguageName = "URI"; // Instead of URD as ur-PK has<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; carib.IetfLanguageTag = carib.CultureName;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; carib.Save("ur-IN.ldml");<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; carib.Register();<br /></strong></span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br />}</strong></span></p>
<p>In the course of putting all that together, someone pointd out an interesting issue in the Urdu (Pakistan) locale. It's native currency name in Windows 7 is</p>
<p><span style="font-size: xx-large;">روپيه</span></p>
<p>which includes U+064a, ARABIC LETTER YEH. This seems like a bug since U+06cc, ARABIC LETTER FARSI YEH almost certainly seems like it would be prefered by Urdu-speaking people in either country.</p>
<p>But in any case the following slightly different string was recommended to me:</p>
<p><span style="font-size: xx-large;">روپیہ</span></p>
<p>so I chose that one in the case of the above code; if you disagree then of course you can change the string, as well as the ThreeLetterWindowsLanguageName I used....</p>
<p>If I am right about the built-in&nbsp;ur-PK data, someone should put in a bug to get that fixed in some future version of Windows,&nbsp;by the way. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Any former NLS testers reading this? :-)</span></strong></p>
<p>If it exists then it is a subtle bug, since as I mentioned in <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/02/14/531572.html" title="Every character has a story #18: U+06cc and U+064a (ARABIC LETTER FARSI YEH and ARABIC LETTER YEH)"><strong>Every character has a story #18: U+06cc and U+064a (ARABIC LETTER FARSI YEH and ARABIC LETTER YEH)</strong></a>, in the initial and medial forms the two letters look identical (and this is obviously the medial form since it is the penultimate chacracter in the string).</p>
<p>Anyway,&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Tahoma;">just take the code, save it to a file as ur-IN.cs, and then compile it from the command line with the following line of code:</span></p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="margin-right: 0px;">
<p><span style="font-family: Consolas,Courier New;"><strong>csc /r:sysglobl.dll ur-IN.cs</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">And once you do that, the landscape in Regional and Language Options will change a little bit:</span></p>
<p><img src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/urduindia01.jpg" border="0" /></p>
<p>And there we go! :-)</p>
<p>Now ideally one would be able to use the reserved LCID value mentioned in those other articles, but that is not an option in this case. </p>
<p>But no solution is perfect....</p>
<p>Sometimes it really still is about <strong>opening it all up</strong> and <strong>getting out of the way</strong>, as best as we can....</p>

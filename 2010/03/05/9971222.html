<P>My friend Doug reminded me of an old SNL skit that seemed kind of topical for the month, which I thought I would share:</P>

<P><FONT face="times new roman,times">Last week we made the comment that March comes in like a lion and goes out like a lamb. Now here to reply is our chief meteorologist, John Belushi, with a seasonal report.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT face="times new roman,times">Thank you Chevy. <BR>Well, another winter is almost over and March true to form has come in like a lion, and hopefully will go out like a lamb. <BR>At least that’s how March works here in the United States.<BR></FONT><FONT face="times new roman,times">But did you know that March behaves differently in other countries? <BR>In Norway, for example, March comes in like a polar bear and goes out like a walrus. <BR>Or, take the case of Honduras where March comes in like a lamb and goes out like a salt marsh harvest mouse.<BR></FONT><FONT face="times new roman,times">Let’s compare this to the Maldive Islands where March comes in like a wildebeest and goes out like an ant. A tiny, little ant about this big. </FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times">Unlike the Malay Peninsula where March comes in like a worm-eating fernbird and goes out like a worm-eating fernbird. In fact, their whole year is like a worm-eating fernbird. <BR></FONT><FONT face="times new roman,times">Or consider the Republic of South Africa where March comes in like a lion and goes out like a different lion. Like one has a mane, and one doesn’t have a mane. <BR>Or in certain parts of South America where March swims in like a sea otter, and then it slithers out like a giant anaconda. </FONT><FONT face="times new roman,times">There you can buy land real cheap, you know. <BR>And there’s a country where March hops in like a kangaroo, and stays a kangaroo for a while, and then it becomes a slightly smaller kangaroo. Then, then, then for a couple of days it’s sort of a cross between a, a frilled lizard and a common house cat.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT face="times new roman,times">Wait wait wait wait. Then it changes back into a smaller kangaroo, and then it goes out like a, like a wild dingo. Now, now, and it’s not Australia! Now, now, you’d think it would be Australia, but it’s not!</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times">Now look, pal! I know a country where March comes in like an emu and goes out like a tapir. And they don’t even know what it means! All right? <BR>Now listen, there are nine different countries, where March comes in like a frog, and goes out like a golden retriever. But that- that’s not the weird part! No, no, the weird part is, is the frog. The frog- The weird part is-</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Thanks Doug, that was an awesome one. </P>
<P>I wonder if it's on video anywhere?</P>
<P>Anyway, it's kind of international, huh? :-)</P>
<P>I don't know about you, but it makes you wonder about what they call The Swedish Chef in Sweden:</P>

<P>It also points out the many companies (including Oopera Sufftvere-a, Guugle-a, Meebu, und Gooeeld Vers) who provide it as a locale, and explains that Trulltech, the developers of Qt, uses "incheffereezeshun" (i15n) to "sput meestekes in zee interneshuneleezeshun" (i19n).</P></div>

<h1>Farsi? Persian? You'll be getting some LIP about it either way</h1>

<P>Hey, guess what?</P>
<P>Microsoft released the Persian (Farsi) Language Interface Pack for Windows 7!</P>
<P>Now this LIP must be installed over English; <STRONG>it is only released in the 32-bit flavor</STRONG>.</P>
<P>You can get it right <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=a1a48de1-e264-48d6-8439-ab7139c9c14d&amp;displaylang=fa" mce_href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=a1a48de1-e264-48d6-8439-ab7139c9c14d&amp;displaylang=fa">here</A>!</P>
<P>I was about the put in some of the language info I have been doing (it came with the internal announcement), info that was included as part of the original release notes....</P>
<P>But then I noticed something.</P>
<P>The info is the same as that I previously posted in the earlier announcement of an earlier version of Windows and its Farsi LIP (in <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/05/16/599204.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/05/16/599204.html"><STRONG>Persian? Or Farsi?</STRONG></A>).</P>
<P>And you don't need me to repeat myself that way when I can just provide you the link....</P>
<P>Either way, the whole Windows 7 release here is exciting, and I hope you enjoy it. :-)</P>
<P>Some time soon I'll talk about the whole 32-bit/64-bit thing, I promise....</P>

</div>
<p><strong>Ctyzanni</strong> on 7 Mar 2010 6:21 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>1) Why is the MS download page only available in &quot;Farsi&quot;? (fa) System administrators who do not read the language may need to download and install it for others.</p>
<p>2) Why is there no 64-bit version? I suppose that is for another upcoming post.</p></div>

<P><FONT color=#ff0000><STRONG>&lt;"workaround" truncated&gt;</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P>That is not a workaround that adds the Farsi LIP to your 64-bit Windows 7, sorry. Let's keep it on-topic, please!</P></div>

<p>No, it is a workaround to add more than 4GB support to 32-bit Windows Vista/7 so you still can run the LIP.</p>

<p>LIPs themselves probably don't require much memory, I am talking about the case where you are running the 32-bit only LIP on a system with more than 4GB of memory.</p>

<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 10 Mar 2010 1:09 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Beyond that, the hack is a very bad idea and is a huge security risk. I would never ever recommend people try it, for any language version.</p>

<p>No idea what you are asking for here.</p>

<p><strong>stillife</strong> on 16 Aug 2010 4:47 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>I&#39;ve been using (and loving) the LIPs since Windows XP. They are really useful for getting people who haven&#39;t mastered English yet to still be connected to the world (like my grandmother). So kudos to Microsoft. Now, there is one problem and that is Microsoft&#39;s refusal to ship a native PDF reader app with Windows (I understand there may be antitrust issues here, but still). That leaves users to have to go for third-party tools like Adobe or Foxit. The problem is that Adobe doesn&#39;t seem to care too much about Farsi users and doesn&#39;t offer any language assistance to Farsi speakers. Foxit doesn&#39;t have any support either (although I&#39;m in the process of creating a translation). The only useable alternative is SummatraPDF. Now I&#39;ve been helping the developer of SummatraPDF with the translation into Farsi (which was started and substantially completed by another user). However, we are having a bit of problem trying to figure out how we can get the program to follow the LTR settings of the underlying Windows. A lot of applications seem to have no problem with this and switch the window controls and menus around once the LIP is installed. We are trying to do the same thing with SummatraPDF. I realize this might not be your area, but I was hoping you would be able to at least point us in the right direction. This way we can at least provide an alternative PDF reader for Farsi speakers until (fingers-crossed) Microsoft comes out with a PDF application for Windows (and includes the language files in the LIP).</p>
<p>Again thanks for your efforts.</p>
<p>Bests,</p>
<p>Still</p>

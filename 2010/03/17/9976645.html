<P>Over in the Suggestion Box, <A href="http://lrc.cornell.edu/asian/faculty/bios/rusk" mce_href="http://lrc.cornell.edu/asian/faculty/bios/rusk">Bruce Rusk</A> asked:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times"><EM>Michael,</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times"><EM>Here's the deal: I'm loving the new IMEs installed with the East Asian language packs for Office 2007 (running under XP Pro). They are a significant improvement over past offerings.</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times"><EM>The Chinese (Traditional) New Phonetic IME in particular is wonderful for me because it includes the whole CJK range, including Extensions A and B (well, presumably those characters within that range for which the Unicode database has Mandarin readings, at least using phonetic input).</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times"><EM>There is a significant issue in how the IME displays characters for selection. After including CJK Extensions A &amp; B (in the properties dialog, under General -&gt; Character set), the whole range is available to input -- I think. See, what happens, so far as I can tell, is this: the IME candidate window shows basic CJK characters in black, Extension A characters in green, and Extension B characters in red. But on my system at least, the green characters show up only as those nasty character-not-found boxes. The Extension B ones appear quite nicely (so there's a bunch of black characters and a bunch of red ones, with the green boxes in the middle).</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times"><EM>I've checked and do have fonts that support both ranges, but a different set for each and none that covers both fully. I've also noticed that, while the older version of MingLiu supplied with XP does not have the Extension A characters, the newer version that comes with Vista does--could that be what the IME is looking for?</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times"><EM>Any ideas about what might be going on?</EM></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Might almost remind you of <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2010/01/21/9951284.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2010/01/21/9951284.html"><STRONG>Can't I pick the candidate list font if I don't speak fluent square box?</STRONG></A> if you squint just right at it, huh? :-)</P>
<P>But this is a very different issue.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, there is no documented/supported (and no undocumented/unsupported) way I know of to change the font that the IMEs would use, and there is no way I know of to get the advanced GDI font linking and Uniscribe font fallback support to make enhancements in Extension A and Extension B (respectively) work better. </P>
<P>So on XP, there is no way to get this working right.</P>
<P>Though if you are running Vista, Server 2008, Windows 7, or Server 2008 R2, everything should work well here. But that upgrade is something of a required step, sorry! :-(</P>

And I did not test it to see if it really works for the IME.</p></div>

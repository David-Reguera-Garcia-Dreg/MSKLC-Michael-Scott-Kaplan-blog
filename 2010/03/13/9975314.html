<P>Okay, I have been promising to&nbsp;blog about the whole thing about 64-bit versus 32-bit builds of Language Interface Packs for a while now.</P>
<P>I figured that means I should actually write a blog about it.</P>
<P>This is that blog. Welcome!</P>
<P>Now this is hardly a new issue. I first ranted about back in August of 2008 in <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/08/02/8805014.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/08/02/8805014.html"><STRONG>A serious lack of overlap with 64</STRONG></A>.</P>
<P>That was (at least on a non-Olympic tangent!)&nbsp;about the fact that no Vista LIPs were being released for 64-bit.</P>
<P>And how I felt that was a mistake.</P>
<P>Now apparently several of the people in the subsidiaries and elsewhere who are the champions, sponsors, or passionately interested parties have made the argument that <STRONG>these principles do not apply to the target market of specific Language Interface Packs</STRONG>.</P>
<P>The current thinking on this issue (subject to change, this&nbsp;blog&nbsp;is not&nbsp;an official&nbsp;statement of intent)&nbsp;applies to thirteen (13) of the Windows 7 LIP languages:</P>

<P>A few of these have not yet been released but they are on their way once they have been completed signed off (they are already on that public roadmap site).</P>
<P>The ones that have been released, I put the links to, above (and I will continue to update this as new ones are released).</P>
<P>And a few that have been released (like Hindi) do not have the 64-bit links yet - those are currently only on the OEM site and the downloads should be available soon.</P>
<P>Now this is not a technical issue, it is purely a market-driven one: whether someone has proven that there is enough of a potential for available 64-bit hardware boxes running windows 7 to make use of&nbsp;a LIP, and at present these are the magic thirteen on the list.</P>
<P>I am going to have to build my own language interface packs on a machine to get some of the key languages that I will want to check out myself (like Amharic when it is available), and hope that the list is expanded based on that proven market need/relevance that will have to drive the decision on a case-by-case basis.</P>
<P>I'll keep you posted on the story of this particular set of long tails of Windows 7 if it (or perhaps if it) develops further....</P>

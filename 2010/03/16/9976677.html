<P>So the other day&nbsp;Matt Glazer&nbsp;asked me via the Contact link:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times">Hi,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm an engineering student studying abroad in China, and came across some problems when I downloaded a technical dictionary program that was written in Chinese. I found that if I changed my system locale, the text would encode properly and I could actually use it (as opposed to boxes, strange accents and question marks).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times">However, this also seems to be messing with outlook and powerpoint for the purposes of bullets, math equations and other non-letter characters. Instead of seeing sigmas or something else I'll see the chinese character for "poly-" or something else stuck in there.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times">My question is this: is there a good way to change the program's locale without having to restart my computer when changing the system locale every time I want to read one language or the other? Perhaps there is a virtual machine setup I could use or something? Any help is appreciated.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Now I don't know, I mean I never did graduate from college or anything, but this sounds like a job for App Locale!</P>
<P>You know, the one I talk about in lots of places, like <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/10/17/834208.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/10/17/834208.html"><STRONG>The version of App Locale that runs on Vista?</STRONG></A>, etc.</P>
<P>If you run that dictionary program under App Locale, then everything should work just fine!</P>
<P>Though in the long run, finding a Unicode dictionary that, rather than supporting the small number of letters in code page 936, supports the other 50,000-odd Han that Unicode defines, is probably a better idea. But this will avoid the reboots for now....</P>

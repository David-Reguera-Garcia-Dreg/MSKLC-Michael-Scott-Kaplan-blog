<h1>When something is just flipping wrong</h1>

<P>There are several people who have appreciated the fact that I am cursing less here, lately.</P>
<P>They may applaud my title choice here as it does appear that I have replaced an offensive-to-some Anglo-Saxon monosyllable also known as "the F word" with a replacement.</P>
<P>Alas that is not what the title does, except as a "conceptual homonym" kind of thing. I meant&nbsp;<STRONG>flipping</STRONG> more literally, actually.</P>
<P>It started&nbsp;the other day, when there were some free t-shirts in the hall at the office.</P>
<P>They weren't company branded or anything, they were&nbsp;just something&nbsp;with a cartoon character saying something.</P>
<P>I didn't take one (too many t-shirts already!), but my Japanese colleague took one as she noticed something interesting, as she said in mail to the team later:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><EM><FONT face="times new roman,times">Some of us got a brown t-shirt today. The t-shirt has Japanese paint and characters on it. I found a WR issue which happens a lot.<BR>They would need a Japanese font for a vertical writing. Who knows we have Japanese font for both vertical writing and horizontal writing?</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>I started kicking myself for&nbsp;not grabbing one of the shirts!</P>
<P>Luckily she also took a picture for us to see:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><IMG style="WIDTH: 349px; HEIGHT: 470px" border=1 src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/JapanShirt.jpg" width=349 height=470 mce_src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/JapanShirt.jpg"></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>After I expressed my interest she explained the joke here:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times">The texts show a (poor) joke. The sentence means ”A team which robot “Haiku” visits goes!” The&nbsp; pronunciation of “Haiku” is the same as “(subject) go(es)” in Japanese, so that sentence contains 2 same pronunciations with different meanings.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times">This mistake happens a lot. I give you another example. That’s the Mariners Official goods “Ichiro Bear.” It has Ichiro’s name in Japanese on it but used a wrong character for the vertical writing:</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><IMG style="WIDTH: 450px; HEIGHT: 600px" border=1 src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/ichiroBear.jpg" width=450 height=600 mce_src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/ichiroBear.jpg"></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>A homonym-based joke in the t-shirt, a-la-<A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/10/30/898260.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/10/30/898260.html"><STRONG>Semper ubi sub ubi</STRONG></A>? Cool!</P>
<P>Though the mistake makes it seem less interesting somehow.</P>
<P>So let's take some Japanese text. This text, say:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=8 face="MS UI Gothic,MS Gothic,MS Mincho,Meiryo">プリンター</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Now let's look at it vertically (how well this works for you may depend on your browser):</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DIV style="WRITING-MODE: tb-rl; WIDTH: 1cm"><FONT size=8 face="MS UI Gothic,MS Gothic,MS Mincho,Meiryo">プリンター</FONT></DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Note how that last Kana, the cho-on, is a vertical line -- it changes in orientation here.</P>
<P>It might help if I make the text smaller here:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=2 face="MS UI Gothic,MS Gothic,MS Mincho,Meiryo">プリンター</FONT></P>
<DIV style="WRITING-MODE: tb-rl; WIDTH: 1cm"><FONT size=2 face="MS UI Gothic,MS Gothic,MS Mincho,Meiryo">プリンター</FONT></DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P mce_keep="true">There is a very small bend in the end of the cho-on in many Japanese fonts (including most of the ones on my machine), one that disappears at larger sizes. Maybe you can see the difference?</P>
<P mce_keep="true">Certainly the text on the bear shows it -- and reveals perhaps a clue as to how it is wrong!</P>
<P mce_keep="true">Anyway, one cannot tell exactly what is going on here since we lack access to the presumably computerized typesetting information, but look at these characters for a second.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">First Horizontally, than vertically:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=2 face="MS UI Gothic,MS Gothic,MS Mincho,Meiryo">ー一丨</FONT></P>
<DIV style="WRITING-MODE: tb-rl; WIDTH: 1cm"><FONT size=2 face="MS UI Gothic,MS Gothic,MS Mincho,Meiryo">ー一丨</FONT></DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P mce_keep="true">Those three are:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<DIV mce_keep="true">
<P>ー U+30fc (KATAKANA-HIRAGANA PROLONGED SOUND MARK)</FONT></P></DIV></LI>
<LI>
<DIV mce_keep="true">
<P>一 U+4e00 (a CJK ideograph - the first one in the main block, in fact)</P></DIV></LI>
<LI>
<DIV mce_keep="true">
<P>丨 U+4e28 (another CJK ideograph)</P></DIV></LI></UL>
<P mce_keep="true">Now what is important to note here?</P>
<P mce_keep="true">Several things:</P>
<P mce_keep="true">
<OL>
<LI>The fact that the first one does the vertical thing in a totally different way than the other two.</LI>
<LI>The different direction of that small bend in the various characters when it is there.</LI></OL>
<P>Now you can perhaps do some forensic typography among these and the various other ideographic and kana&nbsp;characters&nbsp;to help&nbsp;determine what is going on (whether it is incomplete vertical support, a font error, or simply the wrong character being inserted since it will look "almost right" or maybe "right enough" in some circumstances).</P>
<P>It is fair to say that vertical support still has a ways to go before people can avoid such investigations to determine what might be behind the problems here, in any case.</P>
<P>Though in both of the examples above, it is most likely vendor's character selection error. This tendency to sometimes grab whatever character might look right without knowing how it will look when vertical support kicks in is one thing that can keep platform support from working 100% properly....</P></FONT>

Only Internet Explorer (sigh) does the correct transformation. </P></div>

<p><strong>jmdesp</strong> on 1 Mar 2010 3:10 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><P>Mike, if I'm not mistaken, you are cheating vertical text, by making the width of the div where the text displays so short that each character is on the next line therefore appears under the previous one. </P>
<P>I have no idea how IE is doing to guess your intent and change the orientation of cho-on in that case. </P>
<P>You should be using the CSS3 block-progression (or writing-mode) property to do this properly. </P>
<P>Now, neither Firefox, nor Chrome are handling this property correctly, opposite to IE :-)</P>
<P>There's bug 145503 open about that in Firefox (no real progress currently)</P></div>
<p><strong>Steve Williams</strong> on 1 Mar 2010 3:35 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><P>I was reading the blog in Outlook's RSS reader and both lines of text were identical, i.e. horizontal. &nbsp;I then viewed it in Firefox 3.6. &nbsp;It tried to do vertical, but ended up placin the glyphs over each other. &nbsp;In IE 8, the text was vertical, but the large typeface was clipped on the left side. &nbsp;The smaller typeface was displayed correctly.</P>
<P>Ahh, the fun. :)</P></div>
<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 1 Mar 2010 6:24 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><P>Hey jmdesp! I got the hint <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb250415.aspx"><STRONG>here</STRONG></A> and just went with it. Like alchemy! Though I got some insight into how IE does the orientation change -- it is built into code IE uses to read it from the font....</P></div>
<p><strong>Andrew West</strong> on 2 Mar 2010 6:06 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><P>I think that the magic works because the font has two glyphs for U+30FC, one for horizontal layout (a horizontal stroke) and one for vertical layout (a vertical stroke), and when "writing-mode : tb-rl" is applied the correct glyph for vertical layout is selected. So with fonts like MingliU which have only one glyph for U+30FC, the character is rendered as a horizontal stroke in both horizontal and vertical layout.</P>
<P>The same problem occurs with U+3127 (Bopomofo Letter I), although it should be a vertical stroke in horizontal layout and a horizontal stroke in vertical layout, which is the opposite way round to U+30FC. However, I cannot find a single font that renders correctly for both horizontal layout and vertical layout. It seems that the solution used by Microsoft bas been to use a vertical stroke for U+3127 in PRC-targetted fonts (e.g. Microsoft YaHei) which are assumed to be used in horizontal layout only, but to use a horizontal stroke for U+3127 in Taiwan-targetted fonts (e.g. Microsoft JhengHei) which are assumed to be used in vertical layout (at least for typesetting). The result is that the wrong glyph (a horizontal stroke) is normally seen in ordinary horizontal bopomofo text on the internet (e.g. <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bopomofo" rel=nofollow target=_new>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bopomofo</A>). This issue was the reason behind Taiwan proposing to encode separate horizontal and vertical forms of Bopomofo Letter I a couple of years ago (<A href="http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n3246.pdf" rel=nofollow target=_new>http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n3246.pdf</A>), but luckily that proposal did not get very far.</P></div>

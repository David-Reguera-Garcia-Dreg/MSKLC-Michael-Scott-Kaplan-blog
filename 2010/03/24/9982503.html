<P>Over in the Suggestion Box, dmelliott asked:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><EM><FONT face="times new roman,times">I read what I could find about fonts installed in the system not being installed in IE, but I could not find anything about how to solve the problem.&nbsp; I would assume registry hacks?</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Now I am not 100% sure what the question is here, since Internet Explorer doesn't install fonts (and even when it did it was just a few extras for Win9x and NT4 machines).</P>
<P>Maybe it is fonts not showing up in the per-script UI in Internet Explorer, in which case I have talked about the issues of how both choice is determined and selection is stored in blogs such as <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/02/19/535046.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/02/19/535046.html"><STRONG>Where are the IE plain text fonts?</STRONG></A> and <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/04/18/8403631.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/04/18/8403631.html"><STRONG>The importance of Tagalog to Burmese, aka "Of course I'd lie to you, I'm a font!"</STRONG></A>.</P>
<P>Though without any information&nbsp;on either Internet Explorer or Windows version it is hard to guess further than that, or suggest solutions/workarounds/hacks.</P>
<P>Hopefully dmelliott is still around and can provide the additional info....</P>
<hr/><p><strong>Travis</strong> on 24 Mar 2010 9:58 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>I would think what he is referring to is, he has Font Foo installed in Windows and he has some text on a web page that is set to use Font Foo via CSS or something. And IE is not rendering said text using Font Foo.</p></div>
<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 24 Mar 2010 10:02 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Possibly?</p>
<p>But a *lot* more info is gonna be required that was not given, so if that is the case he's gonna have to step up and say so (and explain a lot more about OS version, IE version, font name, how installed, whether a reboot happened, whether the font works other places, etc.)....</p>
<p>I am not a mind reader! :-)</p>

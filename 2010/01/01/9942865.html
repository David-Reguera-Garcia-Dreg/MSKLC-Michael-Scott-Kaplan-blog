<P>It's a new year, and I was thinking I'd start blogging again.</P>
<P>This place has been a source of technology, internationalization, happiness, frustration, love, and hate for many years, with everything from original useful technical content never successfully produced elsewhere to an online nervous breakdown.</P>
<P>The reasons for the stop in blogs are many-fold, perhaps I'll write about&nbsp; some of them one of these days.</P>
<P>But really I had missed not sharing with thousands of my closest strangers, an expression that to this day I still truly love.</P>
<P>But I am technically still on vacation, so I am going to wait to do the technical stuff for a few more days.</P>
<P>Think of this as me easing back in; if the personal posts aren't exactly your case of chai (or your case of chifir) then you can skip it the next few days and pick up on Monday.</P>
<P>All set? Ok, here we go....</P>

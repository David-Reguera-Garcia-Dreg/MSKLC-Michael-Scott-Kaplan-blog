<P>It kind of reminds me of the days back when I blogged about <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/02/02/365993.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/02/02/365993.html"><STRONG>Doing a little more in Sri Lanka....</STRONG></A></P>
<P>Back in the beginning of 2005. After all of the problems in Sri Lanka and an urgent need that people had for help.</P>
<P>Sure lots of money was given, by many people. Many people from Microsoft, in fact.</P>
<P>But there was also some assistance that was of help in a more technological sense, as I mentioned back then.</P>
<P>Well now it is 2010, and another natural disaster has taken place. In Haiti.</P>
<P>Again, the money has been flowing out there, to help with many of the different relief efforts.</P>
<P>Plus one additional effort, discussed in <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/translation/archive/2010/01/24/announcement-haitian-creole-support-in-bing-translator-and-other-microsoft-translator-powered-services.aspx" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/translation/archive/2010/01/24/announcement-haitian-creole-support-in-bing-translator-and-other-microsoft-translator-powered-services.aspx">Announcement: Haitian Creole support in Bing Translator and other Microsoft Translator powered services</A>&nbsp;(see also the info about the bot that can speak the lingo in Haiti, as well --&nbsp;a huge boon in a country like Haiti that has ~55% illiteracy in the country)....</P>

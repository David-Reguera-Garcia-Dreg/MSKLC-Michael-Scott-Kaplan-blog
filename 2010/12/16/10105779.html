<h1>You can't ignore crap and hope it won't cause problems...</h1>

<p>So the question that came up the other day:</p>
<p style="PADDING-LEFT: 90px; FONT-FAMILY: "><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">Hi. I met a unexpected problem when using string.IndexOf. The following code demonstrates the problem:</span></p>
<p style="PADDING-LEFT: 90px; FONT-FAMILY: "><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">string r = "\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd";<br />string tar = "a";<br />Console.WriteLine(tar.IndexOf(r));<br />Can you guess the output? The output is 0, which is very weird for me. Can someone explain why? Because this has broken my program, which assume if a.IndexOf(b)&gt;= 0 Then a.Length &gt;= b.Length.</span></p>
<p>Now the behavior here is by design.</p>
<p>And the reasons for this are covered in my <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/04/09/8367652.html" title="Microsoft is giving this character nada weight but lotsa importance"><strong>Microsoft is giving this character nada weight but lotsa importance</strong></a> blog.</p>
<p>Okay, so U+fffd (aka REPLACEMENT CHARACTER) is now the central way that Microsoft deals with text that is illegal/invalid by Unicode rules, whether due unexpected or unintended corruption of results.</p>
<p>Fine, I can live with that -- conformance is a good thing.</p>
<p>I would prefer to have a way to opt out of the behavior if I am trying to investigate the nature of an intentional attack on security, but I can live with requiring to stay outside of the encoding system provided by the globalization team.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: xx-large;">BUT....</span></p>
<p>And this is a huge BUT, in my opinion!</p>
<p>If you look at what Unicode does here in its <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr10/">UTS 10: Unicode Collation Algorithm</a>, in its <a href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/UCA/6.0.0/allkeys.txt">allkeys.txt</a>::</p>
<p style="PADDING-LEFT: 30px; FONT-FAMILY: "><span style="font-family: courier new,courier;"><strong>0000&nbsp; ; [.0000.0000.0000.0000] # [0000] NULL (in 6429)<br />0001&nbsp; ; [.0000.0000.0000.0000] # [0001] START OF HEADING (in 6429)<br />0002&nbsp; ; [.0000.0000.0000.0000] # [0002] START OF TEXT (in 6429)<br />...<br />FFFC&nbsp; ; [*1490.0020.0002.FFFC] # OBJECT REPLACEMENT CHARACTER<br />FFFD&nbsp; ; [*1491.0020.0002.FFFD] # REPLACEMENT CHARACTER</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;gives the two related characters some weight, while Microsoft's collation data does not.</p>
<p>Now it is not fair to say that on this basis Microsoft isn't conformant, since <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2004/11/28/271121.html" title="Microsoft does not use the Unicode Collation Algorithm"><strong>Microsoft does not use the Unicode Collation Algorithm</strong></a>.</p>
<p>However, it is clear that Microsoft is, while perhaps conformant, accomplishing the goal of making the conformance meaningless for developers.</p>
<p>Because when you get right down to it, if I am comparing</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">LIZ</span></strong></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">&lt;uninterpretable crap&gt;</span><strong>LIZ</strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">&lt;uninterpretable crap&gt;</span></span></span></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>L</strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">&lt;uninterpretable crap&gt;</span></span><strong>I</strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">&lt;uninterpretable crap&gt;</span></span><strong>Z</strong></span></p>
<p>then it is <strong>incorrect</strong> to consider them to be identical.</p>
<p>They are not.</p>
<p>Remember that the official change in Unicode was to get away from the tendency of implementations to drop the invalid characters entirely -- due to security concerns.</p>
<p>But if I say "LA LA LA LA I am not listening to you" to ignore crap when it happens, then I am subverting the whole process of inserting this particular bit of crap to be conformant in the first place.</p>
<p>in my opinion, Microsoft's implementation over the last few years is <strong>not </strong>conformant to the Unicode Standard.</p>
<p>Microsoft can't ignore crap and hope it will go away....</p>
<hr/><p><strong>Cheong</strong> on 16 Dec 2010 9:31 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Yet in the question, we&#39;d expect tar.IndexOf(r) returns -1 because content of r does not exist in tar. I can imagine having it return 0 will case some infinate loop problem in certain data stream processing functions if they&#39;re lazy enough to use string manipulation functions to process data.</p>

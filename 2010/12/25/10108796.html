<p><span style="font-family: comic sans fixed,comic sans ms,sans-serif;">
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>In honor of some principle or another that I find honorable, this entire blog is wrapped in a Comic Sans span!</em></span></p>
<p>I like Comic Sans MS.</p>
<p>There, I said it.</p>
<p>Prior to that I was one of those "There are only two fonts: Arial, and Arial 12pt" types, but the I started enjoying Comic Sans.</p>
<p>Ever since Athena (that terrible MS chat client that got me off the "unpaid MS product support" bandwagon I was on from the CompuServe MSAccess forum days like it was a straight shot of an ebola and hantavirus cocktail.</p>
<p>But I can't hate Athena completely, because she brought Comic Sans MS.</p>
<p>Hell, even after a Q&amp;A with Gary Hustwit (the director of the film <strong>Helvetica</strong>), when asked what would the sequel be, he said that a sequel was unlikely, <em>except maybe Comic Sans</em>. He smiled as we all did, but I think everyone realized that public "Comic Sans spotting" would be as much fun as "Helvetica spotting", and maybe even moreso for the Comic Sans haters....</p>
<p>I even do my own Comic Sans spotting, like in <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/09/21/8960668.html" title="The Company Meeting, the interesting science of Forensic Typography, and what happened after"><strong>The Company Meeting, the interesting science of Forensic Typography, and what happened after</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Now I realize you may not like it. You may be a disciple of <a href="http://bancomicsans.com/">Ban Comic Sans</a>, or&nbsp; an acolyte of <a href="http://www.comicsanscriminal.com/">Comic Sans Criminal</a>.</p>
<p>If so, I feel sorry for you.</p>
<p>I mean, Comic Sans is a hero, like the "This video wasn't long enough, so we made it double-spaced"&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.collegehumor.com/video:1823766">Font Conference</a>&nbsp;College Humor video suggests:</p>

</p>
<p>Even if he sometimes shows up a little too late to actually, in fact, save the day, like this other College Humor video entitled <a target="_blank" href="http://www.collegehumor.com/video:1908292">Font Fight</a>&nbsp;covers (which as a bonus finally settles the Helvetica vs. Arial issue, in a stunningly satisfying way):</p>

</p>
<p>But beyond that, I just like the font.</p>
<p>Now in blogs like </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/05/09/593108.html" title="The font width is broken? Well, fix it!"><strong>The font width is broken? Well, fix it!</strong></a> </li>
<li><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/11/08/5976233.html" title="The [non-]progress of the &amp;uuml;ber-fixed width fonts"><strong>The [non-]progress of the &uuml;ber-fixed width fonts</strong></a>&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/10/29/5752998.html" title="Sometimes everyone is happier when the game is Fixed (aka Consoling Consolas lovers)"><strong>Sometimes everyone is happier when the game is Fixed (aka Consoling Consolas lovers)</strong></a>,</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;in addition to talking about the serious issue of trying to bring the notion of fixed width fonts to complex scripts and trying to get Consolas into the Console, I did bring up my fantasy font -- a fixed width version of Comic Sans:</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: x-large;">Comic Sans Fixed</span></strong></p>
<p>In fact in another blog (<a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/07/06/3723277.html" title="Look out for Font Rage"><strong>Look out for Font Rage</strong></a>) I shared my primitive notion of this font:</p>
<p><img src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/Comic.jpg" /></p>
<p>But in the end, as a going away present from my friend Carolyn Parsons, I finally have it.</p>
<p>You can see it here in Character Map:</p>
<p><img src="http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer-Blogs-Components-WeblogFiles/00-00-00-33-81/3108.comicsansfixed01.jpg" /></p>
<p>though to be honest it looks the same here&nbsp;as regular Comic Sans does, mostly.</p>
<p>So here is a view that kind of shows the effect of it compared to its ancestor:</p>
<p><img src="http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer-Blogs-Components-WeblogFiles/00-00-00-33-81/5008.comicsansfixed02.jpg" /></p>
<p>And maybe you can think about it in a code window.</p>
<p>Or look at (for example) this one from the Frosting project that was about encodings that no one ever used&nbsp;from ten years ago:</p>
<p><img src="http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer-Blogs-Components-WeblogFiles/00-00-00-33-81/2402.comicsansfixed03.jpg" /></p>
<p>This is thoroughly amazing!</p>
<p>Now maybe this font isn't for you.</p>
<p><strong>Actually, I am sure it isn't for you</strong>, since I have no permission to redistribute it! Though Simon did get a copy so it could conceivably ship one day if there were some Microsoft product or scenario designed to cater to people as batshit crazy weird as I am.</p>
<p>But I&nbsp;am pretty happy now in regard to my font situation.</p>
<p>In fact, the one thing that can make me happier (and which <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/10/29/5752998.html" title="Sometimes everyone is happier when the game is Fixed (aka Consoling Consolas lovers)"><strong>Sometimes everyone is happier when the game is Fixed (aka Consoling Consolas lovers)</strong></a>&nbsp;explains how to provide) is C<strong>omic Sans Fixed in the Console!</strong></p>
<p>How <span style="color: #c0c0c0;"><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">senseless</span></span>sansless is that? :-)</p>
</span></p>
<hr/><p><strong>wrp</strong> on 25 Sep 2011 10:00 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>There is a freely distributable font called Untyped that is close to Comic Sans and Chalkboard. You could modify it the same way. Find it at <a href="http://code.google.com/p/i3project/wiki/Fonts" rel="nofollow" target="_new">code.google.com/.../Fonts</a>.</p></div>
<p><strong>codemonkey</strong> on 25 Sep 2011 3:37 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>any way to share it?</p>

<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 26 Sep 2011 9:18 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Well, the font wrp points to may be okay, but I lack most permission for the MS one....</p>

<p><strong>wrp</strong> on 29 Sep 2011 7:55 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>I put a fixed width version of the font in the file test.zip at the previously mentioned site. It looks fine on Linux with strong anti-aliasing enabled. Could you try it and tell me how it looks on your machine? Does it have the same general feel as Comic Sans?</p>

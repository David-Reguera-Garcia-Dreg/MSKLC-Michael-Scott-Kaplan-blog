<p>Back in the middle of April I did a training. A class. A presentation.</p>
<p>On the day it was going to happen, I wrote a blog about it, entitled <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2010/04/14/9995544.html"><strong>REAL engineers use the command line!</strong></a>.</p>
<p>So that any internal Microsoft people who wanted to see it could see it.</p>
<p>I received mail from a bunch of people who were angry that I had not given enough notice, putting up a blog just a few hours beforehand.</p>
<p>So this time I thought I'd put up the information a little earlier!</p>
<p>So here goes....</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">On <strong>Thursday, June 3, 2010, in 86/2833</strong>,&nbsp;I will be presenting my talk entitled <strong>What is a Character?</strong> with the following description:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Unicode mostly makes it easier, but combining characters, surrogate pairs, variation selectors, and Unicode control characters make the user&rsquo;s impression of &ldquo;what is a character&rdquo; often not match the developer definition. This talk is a primer to set the record straight about all of it and most importantly how to not invalidate user data while manipulating it given these different entities that will exist in the data.<br /><br /><em>Note that the target audience is mainly developers -- and the testers who want to pick up the scenarios for several dozen bugs to enter!</em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, if you are internal to Microsoft and would like to pop by, it is going to be a <strong>barn burner</strong>. :-)</p>

<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 3 Jun 2010 12:17 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>I do. But I choose to also post it here, as is my right (being the author). :-)</p>
</div>
<p><strong>zooba</strong> on 5 Jun 2010 4:10 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Absolutely your right, and we like knowing that you do these gigs (it adds credibility ;) ). I just thought it odd that you&#39;d advertise an internal presentation in a public forum when you&#39;ve got wider-reaching internal options (which you&#39;ve also used, so I guess everything&#39;s good.)</p>
<p>How did it go, by the way? Or is there a full blog post coming up?</p>

<p>So.</p>
<p>It was several weeks ago, in <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2010/05/31/10017323.html"><strong>BUG SPOTTING: Identify 1) what the code does, and 2) what they wanted it to do</strong></a>, that I challenged people to explain something about some code, as indicated by the title.</p>
<p>This code:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="code">whcar_t* newParams = <span style="color: blue;">new </span>wchar[MAX_PATH + MAX_PATH]; whcar_t* p = newParams; <span style="color: blue;">while </span>(*<span style="color: blue;">params</span>) {
    *p++ = *<span style="color: blue;">params</span>;
    <span style="color: blue;">params </span>= ::CharNext(<span style="color: blue;">params</span>); 
}
*p = 0;
<span style="color: blue;">return </span>newParams; </pre>
</blockquote>

<p>in fact.</p>
<p>I actually cheated a little here. :-)</p>
<p>When I suggested <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/12/16/9223301.html"><strong><span style="color: #006bad;">The torrents of breaking CharNext/CharPrev</span></strong></a> as a refresher what I didn't say is that the&nbsp;bug in some code&nbsp;that caused <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing">Raymond Chen</a> to in passing notice this other bug in NLS code looked almost identical to the current bug here. :-)</p>
<p>In essence the intent of this code was to be some kind of really smart allocating <strong>wmemcpy</strong> or <strong>wcscpy</strong>&nbsp;in C++.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, it was being so clever in its iteration that it had to use CharNextW rather than ++ for iterating the string, even though it clearly thought they were the same thing.</p>
<p>And they are not, whether there is a bug like the one in <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/12/16/9223301.html"><strong><span style="color: #006bad;">The torrents of breaking CharNext/CharPrev</span></strong></a>&nbsp;or not!</p>
<p>The reasoning for the separate function is unclear though, as is the need to allocate something of size MAX_PATH + MAX_PATH. </p>
<p>That is either twice the path you need or not even close to the amount of path you need, depending on who is using the function.</p>
<p>And none of which would perform better than an inlined wmemcpy of a function anyway. :-)</p>

<h1>Malay or Malaysian?</h1>

<p>After I wrote <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2010/06/04/10018681.html"><strong>Vietnam or Viet Nam or Viá»‡t Nam or ???</strong></a> a few&nbsp;days ago, I got a few people contacting me with their own examples.</p>
<p>I'll try and squeeze in the interesting ones that I know the answer to as future blogs.</p>
<p>One of those future blogs is the one you are reading right now!</p>
<p>This question was about whether the language spoken in <strong>Malaysia</strong> was <strong>Malay</strong> or <strong>Malaysian</strong>.</p>
<p>Now mostly this question is even easier; the language is not generally referred to as <strong>Malaysian</strong>. (that word would be used to refer to someone from Malaysia).</p>
<p>So the answer here is <strong>Malay</strong>. And the native name is (at least in Windows) <strong>Bahasa Melayu</strong>.</p>
<p>These two things are true for the Windows data in both Malaysia <strong>(ms-MY)</strong>&nbsp;and Brunei Darussalam (<strong>ms-BN</strong>)<strong>.</strong> And of course in Indonesia (<strong>id-ID</strong>), as I mentioned in <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2010/05/24/a10013991.html"><strong>"Donesian"&hellip;just east of "Variant" and just north of "Cognito", right?</strong></a>, it is called Indonesian and Bahasa Indonesia (and this language is more or less a specific dialect of Malay).</p>
<p>Though I have heard tell of an official&nbsp;move in Malaysia to try to change the English name to <strong>Bahasa Malaysia</strong>, though I have not found much confirmation on this, and it certainly&nbsp;has&nbsp;not yet reached the level of a change yet in Windows. And it frankly does seem a little odd to me for a language's preferred English name to interject the native word for "Language", which is what <strong>Bahasa</strong> means....</p>
<p>Now the full information beyond this gets into a whole bunch of specific names for the various dialects of <strong>Malay</strong> spoken in different countries, which you can look to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malay_language">Wikipedia</a> for.</p>
<p>That article had one interesting bit that caught my eye:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">In Malaysia, the standard language is called Bahasa Malaysia "Malaysian language". In Singapore, Brunei, and southern Thailand it is called Bahasa Melayu "Malay language", and in Indonesia it is generally called Bahasa Indonesia, "Indonesian language".</span></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If true, that would mean that the native name (LOCALE_SNATIVELANGNAME) in <strong>ms-MY</strong> (Malaysia) is incorrect.</p>
<p>Though no one (so far as I know) has complained yet.. </p>
<p>Though the decade is young.... :-)</p>

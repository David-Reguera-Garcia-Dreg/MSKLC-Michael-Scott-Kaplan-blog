<h1>How come nobody ever told me about The Unicode Blog?</h1>

<p>I remember&nbsp;back in the middle of 2005&nbsp;(when I was getting into blogging and following various bloggers) at some Unicode meeting telling Rick McGowan of Unicode that they should have an RSS feed for announcements.</p>
<p>He thought bit was intertesting, but didn't see a real benefit beyond the announcement distribution lists that had been there for years.</p>
<p>Which is true.</p>
<p>I dropped the matter; I'm no zealot. :-)</p>
<p>Anyway, regular reader Jean just pointed out to me (in response to&nbsp;<a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2010/06/03/10019332.html" title="Unicode 6.0.0 in beta!"><strong>Unicode 6.0.0 in beta!</strong></a> that I should have linked to <a href="http://unicode-inc.blogspot.com/" title="The Unicode Blog">The Unicode Blog</a> in the announcement.</p>
<p>Well shucks.</p>
<p>I didn't even know it existed; no one ever told me!</p>
<p>But there it is:</p>
<p><a href="http://unicode-inc.blogspot.com/"><span style="font-size: large;">http://unicode-inc.blogspot.com/</span></a></p>
<p>I'll razz Rick about that later, of course.</p>
<p>For now I'll put up this blog, and some time before I get on the plane I'll add the link to the side....</p>

<p><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">Warning: this is one of those non-technical blogs that if I had a personal blog would probably have gone there. I'll have something technical tomorrow....</span></em></p>
<p>I thougfht I'd say something about my Saturday night, which ended up being kind of unusual</p>
<p>It all started in a bar in Belltown.</p>
<p>That part is not unusual.</p>
<p>I was just out of a show that was not terribly interesting, and it was just five minutes to the 11pm 545 back to Redmond. And I am lots more than 5 minutes&nbsp;from the stop. Like 10 minutes or so, and the bus is on time (kudos onebusaway!).</p>
<p>So I had a little under an hour to kill for the next (and last) bus....</p>
<p>I can make&nbsp;a drink or two last that long, and the alcohol might numb me to memory of the performance that was inflicted on me earlier.</p>
<p>Anyway, I am at the bar drinking a T&amp;T. </p>
<p>The bartender undercharged me for the drink, but she also got the proportions wrong (you know it's a bad sign when she doesn't know what a T&amp;T <strong>is</strong>). So I felt like we were basically even.</p>
<p>A reasonably attractive woman&nbsp;comes up to the bar, to order a drink. She turns to me and we end up having a conversation, which&nbsp;went (more or less)&nbsp;something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Her:</strong> What's your name?</li>
<li><strong>Me:</strong> Michael. What's yours?</li>
<li><strong>Her: </strong>Dana.</li>
<li><strong>Me:</strong> Pleased to met you, Dana.</li>
</ul>
<p>{at this point, she had gotten her drink, and shifted from&nbsp;neutral into flirt. I figured I did have nearly an hour to kill, so why not?}</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dana:</strong> So what's the story?</li>
<li><strong>Me [looking confused]:</strong> With what?</li>
<li><strong>Dana:</strong> With that chair you're in.</li>
<li><strong>Me: </strong>There isn't really a story exactly.</li>
<li><strong>Dana:</strong> It's up on two wheels.</li>
<li><strong>Me:</strong> Yes...</li>
<li><strong>Dana:</strong> And while I was ordering my drink you adjusted the height. Up.</li>
<li><strong>Me:</strong> Yes...</li>
<li><strong>Dana:</strong> So now it is like&nbsp;my height.</li>
<li><strong>Me:</strong> Yes...</li>
<li><strong>Dana:</strong> You know more than just the word "yes", right?</li>
</ul>
<p>{I am wondering why she set up my next line so well! I wasn't doing well enough to have earned an assist yet}</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Me [pause]:</strong> Um... yes...</li>
<li><strong>Dana [smiling]:</strong> I walked right into that one.</li>
<li><strong>Me:</strong> Sorry. I wasn't sure what you were wondering about the chair, and I didn't want to answer the wrong question.</li>
<li><strong>Dana: </strong>Thoughtful.</li>
<li><strong>Me:</strong> I&nbsp;have my moments.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Dana:</strong> I'm sensing that! {pause} So what's keeping it up on two wheels?</li>
<li><strong>Me:</strong> Would you believe me if I said it was just happy to see you?</li>
<li><strong>Dana [smiling]:</strong> No, I wouldn't. Because you were like this before I even walked into the bar.</li>
<li><strong>Me [also smiling]: </strong>Touch&eacute;. Plus it's not a very good line anyway.</li>
<li><strong>Dana: </strong>It was okay, I've heard better but I've heard much worse, too. I'll give you points for trying, at least.</li>
<li><strong>Me:</strong> Thanks! {pause} What was the question again?</li>
<li><strong>Dana:&nbsp;</strong>What is keeping&nbsp;your chair balancing on two wheels?</li>
<li><strong>Me:</strong> Oh, right. [<strong>deadpan]</strong>&nbsp;Would you believe me if I told you it&nbsp;is by the sheer force of my will?</li>
<li><strong>Dana [smiling mischievously]:</strong> Depends.</li>
</ul>
<p>{I think I am being set up now, but for the life of me I can't tell where she'd be going with this}</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Me:</strong> On what?</li>
<li><strong>Dana [deadpan]:</strong> On whether you were flashing those baby browns at me when you said it!</li>
</ul>
<p>{Okay, I think I'm mostly hooked now. How do women do that, anyway? }</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Me [laughing]:</strong> Wow. If&nbsp;this were&nbsp;tennis, that would be game and&nbsp;set.</li>
<li><strong>Dana [innocent look]:</strong> What if I wanted to keep playing?</li>
<li><strong>Me:</strong> And that would be "ad in" on the last game in the last set, I think!</li>
<li><strong>Dana:</strong> You're giving me way too much credit.</li>
<li><strong>Me [smiling]:</strong> I'm a giver!</li>
<li><strong>Dana [rolling eyes]:</strong> Oh please.</li>
<li><strong>Me [smiling still]:</strong>I'm a pleaser, too.</li>
<li><strong>Dana:</strong> Wow. You seem very polished at this.</li>
</ul>
<p>{I'll come clean and admit the "giver" line came from a Love Monkey episode; but the "pleaser" thing was me spontaneously in the moment! }</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Me:</strong> On the advice of counsel, I refuse to respond to that statement on the grounds that my response&nbsp;could tend to incriminate me....</li>
<li><strong>Dana:</strong> 5th amendment? That makes me wonder...are you actually more of a player type of guy?</li>
<li><strong>Me:</strong> I'm not sure how to answer that one in any way that would convince you I was being truthful.</li>
<li><strong>Dana:</strong> You can just try. If you're lying&nbsp;I'll either fall for it or I won't.</li>
<li><strong>Me:</strong> I have an ex from a few years back who told me at the time I have some serious game....</li>
<li><strong>Dana:</strong> Maybe you're being a little&nbsp;<em>too</em> honest now.</li>
<li><strong>Me [smiling]:</strong>Sorry, I'll work on that.</li>
<li><strong>Dana:</strong> Please don't do that... but do you?</li>
<li><strong>Me:</strong> Do I what?</li>
<li><strong>Dana:</strong> Do you have serious game?</li>
<li><strong>Me:</strong> I might. <strong>[pause]</strong> Though I'm really not playing much anymore....</li>
<li><strong>Dana [smiling]:</strong> I don't know, you're doing okay at the moment!</li>
<li><strong>Me [innocent look]:</strong> Who me? Nah, I'm just waiting for a bus.</li>
<li><strong>Dana:</strong> Now that just sounds like&nbsp;a line to make you seem more casual and aloof.</li>
<li><strong>Me:</strong> It has been in the past, thought not at the moment. The 545 will hit 4th &amp; Pine in twenty minutes, and it is the last bus until 6:30am.</li>
<li><strong>Dana:</strong>Oh, an eastsider. Do you have to go to catch that bus?</li>
<li><strong>Me:</strong> I've got a <em>few</em> more minutes....but soon.</li>
</ul>
<p>She offered to walk to the bus with me as she had to head back to Pioneer Square (she <em>Isn't </em>an eastsider, obviously). Though I ended up missing the bus (I can't go full speed if someone is next to me and they aren't running!).</p>
<p>She offered me her couch, which I accepted gratefully (spending the night outside is less fun).</p>
<p>I warned her that I might try to capture all of this in a blog, and she said that would be fine, though I am under ofrders to try to capture the charm of the situation. Which I think I have.</p>
<p>And I was home on the 6:30am 545 back to Redmond, putting this blog up just an hour or so&nbsp;late.</p>
<p>I'll let you be the judge as to whether I met her criteria or not. But answer soon, she is taking me out to dinner next week&nbsp;to make up for causing me to miss my bus (especially after I pointed out that would make the whole situation an &uuml;ber- win/win for me!) and my homework assignment is to report back on the judgment of the [ir]regular readers here!</p>
<p>In truth not every night goes this well. Obviously. And as a bonus, Dana managed to salvage the night that people assiduously tried to ruin, earlier....</p>
<hr/><p><strong>ΤΖΩΤΖΙΟΥ</strong> on 6 Jun 2010 11:12 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Yes, sometimes life shines a smile on anyone and they live moments to remember, and you stood up to the moment. I sure hope she won&#39;t eventually turn out to be a spy or a recruiter (the pessimist&#39;s view :)</p></div>
<p><strong>parkrrrr</strong> on 7 Jun 2010 5:22 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>I just want to know if you answered her question about the chair.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Surge</strong> on 7 Jun 2010 3:20 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>I hope she&#39;s that interesting all the time, sometimes women go completely different when the flirting is over.</p>
<p>Anyway, well played sir, good luck next week :)</p>

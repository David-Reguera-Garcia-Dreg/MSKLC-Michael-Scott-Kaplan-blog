<h1>We're off script now, brothers and sisters....Let me here you say YEH!</h1>

<P>So the other day, one of our testers noticed what appeared to him to be a possible break in complex script shaping in the recently released Windows 7 Persian LIP in one of the games.</P>
<P>He provided the following screenshot.</P>
<P><IMG style="WIDTH: 615px; HEIGHT: 478px" src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/persiancards.jpg" width=615 height=478 mce_src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/persiancards.jpg"></P>
<P>Now as it turns out there is no bug here.</P>
<P>If you know Persian than you may see that.</P>
<P>And you may even know what this tester (an Israeli with some knowledge of Arabic) was thinking might be a bug.</P>
<P>Or maybe you just took the hint from the title and you are a long time reader who remembers that <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/02/14/531572.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/02/14/531572.html"><STRONG>Every character has a story #18: U+06cc and U+064a (ARABIC LETTER FARSI YEH and ARABIC LETTER YEH)</STRONG></A> blog from several years ago.</P>
<P>Yep, he was seeing that <STRONG>YEH</STRONG> without dots and if this were&nbsp;the Arabic language it would mean that that <STRONG>YEH</STRONG> was playing solitaire commando....</P>
<P>And of course other Arabic script languages are saying <STRONG>YEH</STRONG> even more. Like Pashto (as I mentioned in <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/07/25/4037989.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/07/25/4037989.html"><STRONG>Not a YES man, but maybe a YEH man</STRONG></A>).</P>
<P>To be honest I used to make a lot of similar assumptions about other Latin script languages, so it is easy to see the rules about the letters we know change when another language is using the script we think we know.</P>
<P>Oh well, all's well that ends better, and <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/01/05/509100.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/01/05/509100.html"><STRONG>A script, by any other name</STRONG></A>...</P>
<P>Can I hear you say <STRONG>YEH</STRONG>, with or without a pair (of dots)?</P>

<P>Good question.... I wonder what playing cards in Iran do. Do they use the Hindi digits?</P></div>

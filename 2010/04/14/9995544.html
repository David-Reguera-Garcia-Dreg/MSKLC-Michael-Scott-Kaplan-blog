<P>The title of this blog is, if not true, then at least a lot of fun to say:</P>
<P><FONT size=5>Real engineers use the command line!</FONT></P>
<P>It is not the job of this blog (and this Blog) is not to console anyone who may not feel like they know all about how make the console work for the world.</P>
<P>But if you are internal to Microsoft and want to see the coolest training about how to best handle the whole wide world in the CONSOLE, then you will not want to miss this presentation!</P>
<P>I am gonna be talking about CMD.EXE, the Console -- and also about the managed console, and about PowerShell, and about PowerShell ISE (the "Graphical" PowerShell).</P>
<P>If the room gets too full they will be turning people away, but just in case you want to try to get into</P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000><FONT size=4><STRONG>86/2835</STRONG> <STRONG>from 10:00am to 11:30am on Wednesday, April 14th 2010</STRONG></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>and learn about how "World-Ready" you can and in many cases should make Console applications, this is the training presentation, done by a man balancing on two wheels, then this is where to be!</P>
<P><EM>Ok, not everyone in the world cares about the console <STRONG>that</STRONG> much. But you know what I mean!</EM></P>
<P>If you are not Microsoft internal then you can't come, sorry. But lots of the content will eventually make it into the blog (a little has already) and documentation and other places.</P>
<P>In the presentation, I'll&nbsp;be talking about keyboards, IMEs, fonts, code pages, Unicode, the stuff that works, the stuff that doesn't work [yet], how to make it work in the meantime or in spite of the naysayers and the haters, how to test it out, and how to make it easier to localize. And a lot more!</P>
<P>With the help of many of the fine engineers who will be in the room, future versions of many products will have the opportunity to support the entire world much more effectively....</P>
<P>Hope to see you there, and be sure to introduce yourself if you are a regular (or irregular!) reader here. :-)</P>

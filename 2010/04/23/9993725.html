<P>Regular readers<FONT size=1><SUP>1</SUP></FONT> may remember my <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2009/09/09/9893085.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2009/09/09/9893085.html"><STRONG>On not being in Germany in October</STRONG></A> blog from last September, when I explained that I could not attend the Tamil Internet conference being held in Köln, Germany.</P>
<P>It would have been great to attend.</P>
<P>I have enjoyed the previous Tamil Internet&nbsp;conferences I have attended, the people I met, the feedback I got from people who attended my talks, and the connections I have made (many of which are still around to this day<SUP><FONT size=1>2</FONT></SUP>).</P>
<P>But I have continued during all this time to enjoy the language and the script (and the drama!) of Tamil, as well as the many technical issues that arise around it.</P>
<P>Thus, while it is still early yet<SUP><FONT size=1>3</FONT></SUP>, I am pleased to say on this blog you are reading right now&nbsp;that I plan to&nbsp;speak at&nbsp;the Tamil Internet 2010 Conference in கோயம்புத்தூர் (Coimbatore), also sometimes known as கோவை (Kovai), from June 23rd to June 27th of this year....</P>
<P>When they asked what I would be willing to talk about I suggested four different topics, and they agreed with all of them (plus they suggested one or two more). They covered a wide range from&nbsp;Unicode to TACE16 to Indic text in Microsoft products to&nbsp;linguistic issues to&nbsp;text input to history. And we'll negoitate some of that part a bit (there are aomd poresentations I want to attend, making the continuous Michael show impractical!), and I'll take some extra days in India, while I'm going that far anyway, oif course.</P>
<P>Now in rememberance of prior trips --&nbsp;to Malaysia, India, Thailand, Singapore, and other countries nearby -- at various times during the year, I am preparing myself for the greater heat at time of year I will be there, than the last time I was in India.</P>
<P>And having been to Chennai and Bangalore with a scooter (something I blogged about previously) -- thinking about both the benefits and drawbacks of the scooter --&nbsp;I believe am prepared mentally to spend time in Southern India with an iBot -- in fact I am looking forward to spending time there again, this&nbsp;time with a device that lets me get around much more normally than the scooter did, with all those tall curbs without <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2010/04/04/9990218.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2010/04/04/9990218.html"><STRONG>sidewalk cutouts</STRONG></A>! :-)</P>
<P>Now in blogging this, I know I risk there being some unforeseen circumstance that would keep me from going, but with the visa in progress (no red flags raised yet) and the plane tickets&nbsp;on the way&nbsp;(dittro) I am quite&nbsp;hopeful that this will be happening. And assuming it will, and once the final list of presentations is available I'll put that list&nbsp;up here with information on each.</P>
<P>Along with the blogs while I am there, about what's going on. A future <STRONG>iBot in India</STRONG> series -- have iBots been to India before?</P>
<P>If you are in that part of the world then be sure to pop by to the conference&nbsp;in <STRONG>Kovai</STRONG>, introduce yourself, and mention that you are a reader here!</P>
<P>Other places that might be visited while I am there are still being considered....</P>

<P><FONT size=1>1 - Also irregular readers with somewhat consistent reading habits<BR>2 - This is the principal reason I ultimately bowed out of the idea of doing confidential work for the US government since the SF-86 is much more complicated to fill out for Top Secret clearance if you have as much foreign travel as I have had and as much regular contact with foreign nationals, not to mention how much travel I have simply forgotten....<BR>3 - and there is many a slip twixt a cup and a lip, aa they say.</FONT></P>

Very beautiful city and many places around for site-seeing. I am in Mysore from last September. We have a community group at Mysore called Mysore Geeks (www.mysoregeeks.com). I am inviting you to give a session there similar to the one you did at Bangalore DotNet User Group. I will be your chauffer at Mysore (very highly over qualified one for that job :))</p>

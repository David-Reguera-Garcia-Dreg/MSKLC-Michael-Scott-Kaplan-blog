<P>Now just so you know.... I might see if I can submit a talk or three myself, perhaps on some of the things I am doing related to collation, or language, or Tamil, or Bidi, or localizability, or keyboards, or one of the many other things I find myself doing these days. I'll keep you posted if anything happens. :-)</P>

<P>One thing about this blog....</P>
<P>It is [apparently] kinda popular.</P>
<P>I have no clue why. Truly I don't.</P>
<P>If you can believe the stats about it, then it ranks #32 of all the blogs on the server, and if you take off the team blogs for a moment (like IE and Excel and Outlook and such), then it is like #14.</P>
<P><EM>If you don't count <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing">Raymond</A>'s <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2010/03/31/9987780.aspx" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2010/03/31/9987780.aspx">bump late last month</A>&nbsp;that awoke a March 31st reddit burp and ycombinator belch, then the numbers are more&nbsp;accurately #34 and #16, for what its worth. That'll sort itself out soon enough when the UNIX heads realize I'm not teasing them with every blog!</EM></P>
<P>So the number is real. As unreal as that may seem to me.</P>
<P>Like when the girl&nbsp;I'm going out with says she thinks&nbsp;I'm hot. I never know what to do to that, since I don't think I am. They certainly didn't all say it. </P>
<P>My self image is a bit like that Cerebus picture in the corner; I think they may eventually see me that way.</P>
<P>But the looking hot thing&nbsp;is weird, like these numbers. And the numbers are even&nbsp;weirder than the girlfriends&nbsp;since&nbsp;the numbers&nbsp;don't seem to be breaking up with me quite as readily even when I abanadon them for months for no good reason, or have an online nervous breakdown over the death of a friend, and no matter how outrageous I've been over these last few years<SUP><FONT size=1>1</FONT></SUP>.</P>
<P>Maybe&nbsp;the Blog&nbsp;fills some unique niche; I had a reader point out to me that if you look at the Official Google Blog they have 27 posts on accessibility, 2 on Africa, 8 on Asia, 24 on Europe, 8 on Geo, 11 on India, 7 on Latin America, and 0 on Unicode, 0 on Globalization, 0 on internationalization, 0 on localization, 0 on translation, 0 on localizability, 0 on langauge, and 0 on linguistics.</P>
<P>I pointed out that this might be unfair since some of those regional tags might point to relevant content. And they did have the blog <A href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/04/goats-are-baaaahk.html" mce_href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/04/goats-are-baaaahk.html">about the goats</A>, which&nbsp;was kind of cool and I'll give them props for.</P>
<P>Plus I am hardly in competition with the Official Google Blog&nbsp;anyway<SUP><FONT size=1>2</FONT></SUP>.</P>
<P>Anyway, if you compare the number of comments per blog on this Blog, the numbers are much lower than most of the others on the server&nbsp;-- even ones lower in the stats.</P>
<P>I can't quite figure it --&nbsp;maybe people pop in and leave when they realize I'll be talking about Mongolian or uppercase or song lyrics or iBots or&nbsp;Unicode or whatever, so they never make it to the bottom of the page where the Comments box is.</P>
<P>Actually, I know that probably isn't what it is --&nbsp;the issue&nbsp;is that the majority of the traffic is people coming off of Bing or Google searches. More and more Bing, by the way -- and not just from the search box here. Like Bing from <STRONG>outside</STRONG> the server.</P>
<P>So when I talk about "regular readers" as if there are many of them, the number is probably not as huge as the "rank" might indicate; people just show up here searching for answers to some random thing, and I happen to write about all kinds of random things. So Presto, people get their answer and go.</P>
<P>I'll keep the myth going and talk about regular readers as if you've all&nbsp;been here for the last half decade or so, like me.</P>
<P>Hope that's okay, if not then you're leaving anyhow so who cares? :-)</P>
<P>Anyway, if you've been around here for a few years at least, you may remember a little over two years ago, when I reported (in <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/02/23/7861817.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/02/23/7861817.html"><STRONG>Despite progression, the bug calls out to me quite LAOdly</STRONG></A>) how the Laotian sorting in Windows did well on the consonants but not so much on vowels and tone marks. And that it was essentially broken.</P>
<P>In comments, <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/02/23/7861817.html#7889895" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/02/23/7861817.html#7889895">John Durdin</A><FONT size=1><SUP>3</SUP></FONT> and&nbsp;<A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/02/23/7861817.html#7896870" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/02/23/7861817.html#7896870">Marc Durdin</A><SUP><FONT size=1>4</FONT></SUP> expressed concern that even if the bug did not exist it is likely that more would need to be done&nbsp;and that Lao sorting would not have looked right if it was just a matter of adding the proper weights to these code points; some <STRONG>compressions</STRONG> (what the UCA calls <STRONG>contractions</STRONG>) would be needed.</P>
<P>We do that with Thai (299 2-to-1 compressions and 230 3-to-1 compressions, which when applied put us within conformance range with the Royal Thai sort).</P>
<P>Which makes their claims a reasonable set of suppositions.</P>
<P>So obviously they, knowing a hell of a lot more than I do about Laotian,&nbsp;would be likely to be&nbsp;correct.</P>
<P>And as it turns out, they were.</P>
<P>Windows 7 added a 464-entry 2-to-1 Laotian&nbsp;compression table covering a huge array of letter and vowel combinations.</P>
<P>Clearly someone felt the Vista sort wasn't the full solution.</P>
<P>Maybe even th same person!</P>
<P>However, in thinking about John and Marc's words....</P>
<P>And the fact that the MAI EK, MAI THO, MAI TI, and MAI CATAWA tone marks were given alphabetic (primary) weight....</P>
<P>And the fact that there are no 3-to-1 or 4-to-1 compressions to&nbsp;allow for the clustering requirements they both suggested (which is&nbsp;pretty much&nbsp;how we do it&nbsp;for Thai)....</P>
<P>All of that&nbsp;makes me suspect that Lao sorting may well be closer to goal&nbsp;but is likely still off the mark in Windows 7.</P>
<P>I will have to wait to hear from some of these <STRONG>very interested people</STRONG>&nbsp;on how close it ends up being -- it may also be right under the "hundreds of wrong answers that give you a right behavior" principle that table based collations can sometimes bring to the mix, which are unsatisfying to linguists since hundreds of wrongs shouldn't make a right, but I tend to be okay with due to being more results driven....</P>
<P>Anyone have any opinions on this? :-)</P>

<P mce_keep="true"><FONT size=1>1- With the arguable high point being when a VP asked why&nbsp;I wasn't being fired and one HR Generalist offered me an only midly insukting RIF. Though he left and&nbsp;so did she,&nbsp;so I guess that movement kind of fizzled out.<BR><BR></FONT><FONT size=1>2&nbsp;- Or looking for people&nbsp;who think I'm hot.<BR><BR>3 - Spake John: "Conventions for sorting are probably still not fully accepted in Lao PDR, but sorting according to the rules given in Kerr's 1972 Lao-English Dictionary is widely followed. &nbsp;The algorithm is (primarily) phonetic, unlike Thai, which uses an orthographic sorting approach. &nbsp;From a user's perspective, it is much easier, since you can find a word in a dictionary without knowing how it is spelled. &nbsp;Most Thai university students do not use a dictionary effectively - if you don't know how the word is spelled, it can be quite hard to find it (and Thai, like English, has very irregular spelling). &nbsp;The problem with the Lao approach is that words (or text) *must* be split at syllable boundaries (reasonably well) before determining the sorting key for each syllable, which adds computational complexity, but can be done."<BR><BR>4&nbsp;- Spake Marc: "I'm not quite sure I can see how the sorting can even kinda work without taking each syllable as a whole. &nbsp;Do you work on a syllable-by-syllable basis? Unless you take each syllable as a whole (initial consonant, final consonant, vowel, tone), the sorting just won't work. &nbsp;And because there can be ambiguity with final consonants and open syllables, you really need to split each syllable before sorting."</FONT></P>

Sometimes it contains information that enable me to evade potential errors in the code. And some of the information be found is difficult to form effective queries in search engines.</p>
<p>Look up a blog for information takes max. 30 seconds a day, but save you potentially days for debuging. Doesn't sound like a bad deal, right?</p>
<p>That said, I have to say I found some blog entries quite interesting / thought provoking. Thank you for providing us some many stuff of dubious value.</p></div>

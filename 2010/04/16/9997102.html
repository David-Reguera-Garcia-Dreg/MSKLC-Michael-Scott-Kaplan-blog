<h1>Capitalized tag != capitalized month</h1>

<P>The question was simple enough:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><EM>I noticed that the long date format in Windows 7 is shown as “d’ de ‘MMMM’ de ‘yyyy” (Spanish) which is in upper case but still the month is displayed in&nbsp; lower case. </EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Luckily the answer is simple, too! :-)</P>
<P><IMG style="WIDTH: 370px; HEIGHT: 431px" src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/upperlower.jpg" width=370 height=431 mce_src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/upperlower.jpg"></P>
<P>The uppercase <STRONG>MMMM</STRONG> in the long date, just as the uppercase <STRONG>MM</STRONG> above it in the short date, are not an indication that the month is to be capitalized or not.</P>
<P>After all, <STRONG>MM</STRONG> is going to put a number in there!</P>
<P>The uppercase <STRONG>M</STRONG> is used to indicate that something is to be done with the <STRONG>month</STRONG>!</P>
<P>&nbsp;The lowercase <STRONG>m</STRONG> has another purpose - it is used for thwe minutes, as you can see in the short time and long time formats right below the date formats.</P>
<P>Windows never overlaps these two, but they are kept this separate due to the fact that several years ago a decision wtheas made that using <STRONG>M</STRONG> and <STRONG>m</STRONG> in this way was less confusing then case insensitive format tags and using another letter for one of them, e.g. <STRONG>M</STRONG> and <STRONG>N</STRONG>.</P>
<P>This is just as well since in .Net you can have the date and time format in the same string, which would have forced a different solution anyway....</P>
<P>Whether the month name is capitalized is part of the underlying locale data and in ordinary circumstances is neither override-able nor customizable!</P>

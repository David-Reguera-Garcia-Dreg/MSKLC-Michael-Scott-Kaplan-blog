On the Spanish side there are three Basque provinces --&nbsp; Alava (Araba), Biskaia (Biskay), and Gipuzkoa -- which form the Autonomous Basque Community (CAV), where Basque is official regional language. Basque is also spoken in the northern area of the Autonomous Region of Navarra (Nafarroa) of north central Spain and in the French department of Pyrenées Atlantiques.<BR>Basque grammar is extremely complicated – starting with the fact that the subject of a sentence looks different depending on whether the verb has an object or not (This is called an ergative-absolutive system.)<BR>After the suppression of Spain’s regional languages under Franco, Basque has recovered and the number of Basque speakers is even increasing. There is an upsurge in its use in literature, the media and higher education. A Basque language academy is leading standardization of the language which has widely divergent dialects. Today Basque is one of Spain’s four official languages.<BR><STRONG>FUN FACTS</STRONG>:<BR>•&nbsp;The is no f sound in Basque - the letter f is pronounced as an h. <BR>•&nbsp;For numbers, Basque uses a system based on 20 for the tens: hogei is 20, hogeitamar 30, berrogai 40, berrogai eta hamar 50, hirurgei 60, larogei 80. Might this be where the French quatre-vingts (literally four twenties, 80) comes from?<BR><STRONG>CLASSIFICATION</STRONG>: Basque is a language isolate, meaning it has no known relatives. It is unrelated to the surrounding Indo-European languages and no connection to other languages has so far been proven (although linguists have tried to trace the origin of the language for a long time, and theories have proposed linking the language to languages as remote as Georgian).<BR><STRONG>SCRIPT</STRONG>: Basque is written in Latin script. The letters c, q, v, w, y, which are only used for loan words are not considered part of the alphabet. The orthography of Basque has been influenced by Spanish.<BR><STRONG>MORE INFO</STRONG>: <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basque_language" mce_href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basque_language">here</A><BR></LI>

It is also spoken in the neighboring countries of Tajikistan (1.2 million speakers), Kyrgyzstan (550,000), Kazakhstan (330,000) and Turkemistan (320,000).<BR>Southern Uzbek, which is spoken in Afghanistan by 1.4 million speakers, is closely related but considered as a separate language by most scholars.<BR><STRONG>FUN FACT:</STRONG>&nbsp;The name "Uzbek" is said to be derived from the Kazakh ruler Uzbek Khan who ruled over what became the Uzbek people in the 16th century. <BR><STRONG>CLASSIFICATION:</STRONG> Uzbek is a member of the South Eastern or Uighur group of the Turkic language family. The most closely related language is Uighur.<BR><STRONG>SCRIPT:</STRONG> Before 1923, Uzbek was written in a modified Persian-Arabic script, like all Central Asian languages. The alphabet was adapted to Uzbek in 1923, but in 1929 a Latin alphabet was introduced. This again was replaced by Cyrillic in 1939/1940.<BR>During a 1992 conference of all Turkic-speaking nations in Ankara, it was decided to introduce the Latin script for all participating countries. Uzbekistan started the transition in 1997 and made a modified Latin script official. However, the deadline for full transition has been moved continuously, and Cyrillic is still widely used.<BR><STRONG>MORE INFO:</STRONG> <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzbek_language" mce_href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzbek_language">here</A><BR></LI>

<h1>Are you old enough to get your Bosnian on?</h1>

<P>The question was one that regular readers might recognize:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times"><EM>Hi,</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times"><EM>I have a customer who’s trying to create CultureInfo for bs-Latn-BA (Bosnian Latin) in a .NET Framework 1.1 application using the below statement:</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times"><EM>System.Globalization.CultureInfo c = new System.Globalization.CultureInfo(“bs-Latn-BA”);</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times"><EM>They are getting “System.ArgumentException: Culture name bs-Latn-BA is not supported. Parameter name: name”. However, if they try the same thing in .NET Framework 2.0, it works. </EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times"><EM>The exception message appears clear but I just wanted to make sure that bs-Latn-BA is absolutely not supported (no workaround or anything) in .NET 1.1 before I tell them.</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times"><EM>Any ideas, resources, documentations that you can point me to?</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times"><EM>Note that they are running this on Windows Server 2003 SP2. </EM></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Sound familiar?</P>
<P>This is that <STRONG>Windows-Only Culture</STRONG> feature, where .Net synthesizes a new CultureInfo from Windows when it can't get the data from its own store (due to it not being there).</P>
<P>There is an MSDN topic that talks about them <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms172470.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms172470.aspx">here</A>, and of course you can check out blogs here by searching for <A href="http://www.bing.com/search?q=Windlows-only+cultures+site%3Ablogs.msdn.com%2Fmichkap&amp;form=QBRE&amp;qs=n&amp;sk=" mce_href="http://www.bing.com/search?q=Windlows-only+cultures+site%3Ablogs.msdn.com%2Fmichkap&amp;form=QBRE&amp;qs=n&amp;sk=">Windows-only cultures</A>&nbsp;if you want to learn way too much about them, more than any normal human would really need.</P>
<P>The most relevant bit to the original question is that this feature was added in .NET 2.0 -- which is why this CultureInfo cannot be created in 1.1.</P>
<P>So version&nbsp; 1.1 isn't old enough if you want to get your Bosnian on....</P>

<P>This is <STRONG>not</STRONG> a post about flashing people while telling them how to be more world ready with their code!</P>
<P>This is, however,&nbsp;a post about Adobe's Flash.</P>
<P>Not about the whole Apple/Adobe HTML5/Flash thing that everyone else is writing about that is so controversial.</P>
<P>As fascinating as that may be for some.</P>
<P><EM>For the record, none of my friends at Apple, Adobe, <STRONG>or</STRONG> Microsoft find that stuff to be something fun to engage on, but clearly there are people somewhere having a good time with it. I don't personally know any of them as far as I know.</EM></P>
<P>Anyway, this is about something my friend Mihai at Adobe told me about.</P>
<P>You see, for as long as I have known about/dealt with Flash, what I have found most frustrating was the lack of globalization support.</P>
<P>It drove me nuts, in fact, any time I had to deal with it (some high profile web sites I was helping people with had major issues because of this lack!).</P>
<P>But no longer.</P>

<P>Mihai gave me some of the skinny on the internal, and in some ways it is similar to Silverlight as it uses the underlying platform it is running on for a lot of the support (as I talked about Silverlight doing back in blogs like <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/10/16/9001396.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/10/16/9001396.html"><STRONG>Shine a Little [Silver]Light</STRONG></A>). Though in the case of flash.globalization, if the platform lacks a solid story then it falls back to ICU. This does not apply to Windows, where the existing support is used.</P>
<P><STRONG>It supports custom cultures/custom locales!</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>It is all name based, using the RFC!</STRONG></P>
<P>Not even the newest version&nbsp;of Office (due out soon?) can say that, and they have an XML-based standard and over a decade of notice about doing that....</P>
<P>And there were other interesting bonuses I found out from Mihai when talking about flash.globalization. Like remember <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2010/02/16/9964017.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2010/02/16/9964017.html">LOCALE_SDECIMAL? Quite a character! Or two. Or three...</A> from the other day? The one that broke the new Windows Calculator and has caused problems for Excel and other parts of Microsoft products?</P>
<P>Well flash.globalization can handle multiple characters in those locale fields like <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd373841.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd373841.aspx">LOCALE_SDECIMAL</A> and <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd373895.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd373895.aspx">LOCALE_STHOUSAND</A> and so forth. In parsing <STRONG>and</STRONG> formatting.</P>
<P>I'll need to check on things like <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd373837.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd373837.aspx">LOCALE_SDATE</A> and <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd373896.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd373896.aspx">LOCALE_STIME</A> to make sure they work too, though I must admit I am optimistic that if there is a bug I won't be fielding questions about whether such things really happen in shipping locales. No offense to people who might be inclined to do that, of course! :-)</P>
<P>Here is another reference if you are hungry for information in it:</P>
<P><A href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer/articles/flash_globalization_package.html" mce_href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer/articles/flash_globalization_package.html">The flash.globalization package in Flash Player: Cultural diversity without complexity</A></P>
<P>Some very cool information here about using it for those who might be interested.</P>
<P>Anyway, thinking about a third party component that is able to consume so much of the functionality that I have been working with, on, in, and around for so long to improve the story on a platform that used to not do any of this is really really exciting!</P>

<p><a id="9970389" href="#9970389">#</a> <strong>Mihai</strong> on 27 Feb 2010 12:00 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><P>I guess the complaint was about relying on the underlying OS services.</P>
<P>But we had to choose between what the developers want (platform-independence) and what the end-user wants (consistency with all the familiar behavior, respect for his preferences).</P>
<P>As a developer I want the same result, guaranteed, on all platforms.</P>
<P>But as an end-user I don't care about developers. I don't move between Windows, Mac and Linux, so I don't care about that consistency. But I do move between Flash/AIR/Excel/etc. and I don't appreciate if applications that don't respect my Control Panel preferences.</P>
<P>A tough choice to make.</P>
<P>But we think that in the end our developers also appreciate the experience of the end user more than their own comfort.</P>
<P>Anyway, that this kind of discussion will happen, and we'll explain all decisions, I promise nothing was random (or laziness ;-)</P>
<P>But not on Michael's blog :-)</P></div>

<p><strong>Mihai</strong> on 18 Jun 2010 3:48 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>It is fine since Player 10.0, released about one and a half year ago.</p>
<p>With that version the Player introduced a new text engine.</p>
<p>But it takes time until all the tooling catches up (think Flash Pro, Flex, others)</p>
<p>The engine adds support for Indic scripts, bidi (Arabic and Hebrew), vertical text (useful for Chinese and Japanese), and advanced typography features for other scripts (including Latin)</p>
<p>If you want to use the engine with older tools, you should download the Text Layout Framework library from <a target="_new" rel="nofollow" href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/textlayout/">labs.adobe.com/.../textlayout</a>.</p>
<p>The tools are also catching up.</p>
<p>Flash Pro in Creative Suite 5 addresses that for designers, and Flex 4 deals with it for programmers.</p></div>

<P>NOTEPAD adds a BOM (Byte Order Mark) when you save a file in the UTF-8 encoding.</P>
<P>Always<FONT size=1><SUP>1</SUP></FONT>.</P>
<P>You'd think that since Windows Notepad has been doing this for over 319680000 seconds<FONT size=1><SUP>2</SUP></FONT>, and that the combined usage of Windows 2000<FONT size=1><SUP>3</SUP></FONT>, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows XP 64-bit, Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2 is so high that it may well blow your mind to calculate the number, that people would have gotten over this by now.</P>
<P>But no.</P>
<P>As recently as yesterday<FONT size=1><SUP>4</SUP></FONT>, people were making comments again in that <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/03/11/8152232.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/03/11/8152232.html"><STRONG>Why are UTF-8 encoded Unix shell scripts *ever* written or edited in Notepad?</STRONG></A> blog, the one where I officially&nbsp;suggested that these people who don't like the Notepad behavior of inserting a BOM in front of UTF-8 files had a simple remedy:</P>

<P>Yet for some reason people are still arguing it.</P>

<LI>you chose to save it as UTF-8 and</LI>
<LI>you opened the file up again and</LI>

<p>I'm not entirely sure what you mean by 'game over,' but it seems to be something along the lines of 'this is what Notepad does and that's final.' I have to agree that that's probably never going to be fixed (though developers for new apps probably have other options today, like using a file attribute, say). The thing we can forever lament (loudly, at every opportunity) is that people don't take your advice and we end up with people complaining about problems like <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/301623">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/301623</a></p>

<p>Anyone who agrees with Peter Constable's reasoning: &quot;for better or worse, plain text processes that support UTF-8 are going to encounter UTF-8 data beginning with a BOM: learn to live with it!&quot; should also agree that processes that support UTF-8 are going to encounter UTF-8 data that doesn't begin with U+FEFF, and that they should 'learn to live with it.' For what reason wouldn't cl.exe support a switch for encoding?</p></div>

<p>Ok, I am not happy about Notepad doing that, but I got over it.</p>
<p>I would ask something else though: if UNIX/Linux claims to be Unicode aware at least a little bit (after 19 years of Unicode), why the shell does honor the BOM, using it to detect the UTF-8 even if (for some crazy reason) my locale is set to en_US.iso88591?</p>

<p>One way to maintain that feature of Notepad without prohibiting the storage of UTF-8 text that doesn't ﻿begin with a certain character would be to stick the encoding metadata in a file attribute. Someone else may be able to think of a better way though.</p>
<p>Another possibility I hope to see someday is Windows using a UTF-8 codepage. Michael has said that's not possible, and if that's the case then it's a real shame that we'll never be able to move away from using legacy encodings as the default.</p></div>

<p>And a UTF-8 &quot;code page&quot; (which exists now -- 65001) would not change the nature of the problem. </p>
<p>The signature fixes the problem, and since the user who might hit that bug has no workarolund while the user of Unix shell scripts has many, the current resolution, determined over a decade ago, can and will stand.</p>

<p>Currently Notepad has the option to save files using the CP_ACP, UTF-16 and UTF-8. As the UTF-8 signature is intended to disambiguate between files specified as UTF-8 the ACP, if the ACP and UTF-8 options were the same then that dialogue you showed would never be needed even without a disambiguating mark. It seems to me that that does change the nature of the problem.</p>
<p>&quot;The signature fixes the problem, and since the user who might hit that bug has no workarolund _[1]_ while the user of Unix shell scripts has many, the current resolution, determined over a decade ago, can and will stand.&quot;</p>
<p>Again, I think the solution you offered (STOP USING WINDOWS NOTEPAD!) is perfectly reasonable. As long as that solution is always preferred over, say, changing standards to require parsers to accept a ZWNBS that doesn't fit into their grammar at the beginning of files, then there's little to complain about here. (Though we can still complain about other programs failing to handle UTF-8 that doesn't begin with ZWNBS.)</p>
<p>Re: file attributes</p>
<p>Well, perhaps it's enough if just NTFS supports it. Or maybe someday the file system support could be extended to support attributes on any file system the way some other systems support storing their arbitrary attributes even on e.g. FAT32.</p>
<p>I don't care too much about this, since really I'd like to just get away from legacy encodings, but something like this is necessary to support legacy encodings. Without it you have to put a special signature at the beginning of all text files to identify which encoding, or you have to guess at encoding, or you just have to put up with potential data corruption when a file created on a system with one code page is edited on a system with a different code page.</p>
<p>1. I would suggest that the dialogue box you showed, or better yet, a dialogue that presents the encoding options directly, _is_ a workaround.</p></div>

<p>Personally, of course, I DON'T use notepad.

<p>Personally, I think it should be absolutely mandated that every UTF-8 file must start with a BOM, just like UTF-16 files. &nbsp;Otherwise there isn't any useful way to tell whether any given file is in UTF-8 or ANSI, short of scanning the file and hoping to encounter useful characters you can use to guess correctly (which seems undesirable).</p>
<p>And for the people arguing &quot;just ignore the ANSI files, they're old and crusty&quot; -- do you *know* how many plain ANSI files there are lying around? &nbsp;Do you *really* think it'd be a good idea to render a significant number of them unreadable?</p></div>

<p>Any decent text editor on unix or linux will let you specify the encoding to use when writing files, and will likely default to either ISO8859-1, or UTF-8 WITHOUT stupid BOM.</p>
<p>E.g. GNU Emacs: set-buffer-file-coding-system (C-x RET f) will let you choose from a large range of utf-8 variants (and many other encoding schemes, including various ebcdic variants...). &nbsp;The -with-signature ones write a BOM. &nbsp;The -unix/-dos/-mac ones use LF / CRLF/ CR line endings.</p></div>

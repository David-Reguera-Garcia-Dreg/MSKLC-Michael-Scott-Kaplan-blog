<P>On a sunny afternoon on July 15th, 2006 my blog <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/07/15/666779.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/07/15/666779.html"><STRONG>Uighur or Uyghur?</STRONG></A> was unleashed on an unsuspecting populace.</P>
<P>Even moreso than many of the similar issues that have come up, the legislative efforts alone were impressive.</P>
<P>And while the information was not finalized and communicated officially in time for Vista, it was indeed in time for Windows 7, thus:</P>
<P><IMG style="WIDTH: 477px; HEIGHT: 550px" src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/uyghur1.jpg" width=477 height=550 mce_src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/uyghur1.jpg"></P>
<P>Yea, got it!</P>
<P>Well, not entirely, actually. :-(</P>
<P>If you add the keyboard, as I mentioned <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2010/02/25/9967827.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2010/02/25/9967827.html"><STRONG>yesterday</STRONG></A>, you start to see the other half of the problem:</P>
<P><IMG style="WIDTH: 431px; HEIGHT: 491px" src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/uyghur2.jpg" width=431 height=491 mce_src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/uyghur2.jpg"></P>
<P>See that <STRONG>UI</STRONG>? There is still an "I" there. Thus in the keyboard list:</P>
<P><IMG style="WIDTH: 245px; HEIGHT: 221px" src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/uyghur3.jpg" width=245 height=221 mce_src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/uyghur3.jpg"></P>
<P>and once it is selected:</P>
<P><IMG style="WIDTH: 343px; HEIGHT: 42px" src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/uyghur4.jpg" width=343 height=42 mce_src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/uyghur4.jpg"></P>
<P>Hey, why is the legacy keyboard the one listed if I asked for both of them? Weird.</P>
<P>Let's fix that:</P>
<P><IMG style="WIDTH: 329px; HEIGHT: 87px" src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/uyghur5.jpg" width=329 height=87 mce_src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/uyghur5.jpg"></P>
<P>and select that other one, the one with the right letter:</P>
<P><IMG style="WIDTH: 321px; HEIGHT: 57px" src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/uyghur6.jpg" width=321 height=57 mce_src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/uyghur6.jpg"></P>
<P>Ok, that is better.</P>
<P>Now this remaining issue is the one I described in other blogs.</P>
<P>Blogs like <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/02/17/375235.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/02/17/375235.html"><STRONG>LOCALE_SABBREVLANGNAME is so not an ISO-639 code</STRONG></A>&nbsp;that talk about the issue generally, and <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/09/27/773341.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/09/27/773341.html"><STRONG>LOCALE_SABBREVLANGNAME is more than just an ISO-639 code</STRONG></A> which talk about Uyghur more specifically, and how the decision ended up working there.</P>
<P>This is obviously a less than perfect solution since now this artifact of <STRONG>UI - Uyghur</STRONG> is with us, with not muh more than some blogs of mine to explain why. But changing the ISO-639 code is a huge problem for a lot of people affecting a lot more areas than just this one, and changing the mechanism the Language Bar uses to represent languages would also have much wider impact than fixing this one case.</P>
<P>But&nbsp;we learn to live with issues like <STRONG>DE - German</STRONG> and <STRONG>ES - Spanish</STRONG> and <STRONG>EL - Greek</STRONG> and more recenty <STRONG>FA - Persian</STRONG>. So it is not like this is without precedent (for the record the first 3 of those four examples are due to native name spelling and the fourth is an issue similar in many ways to the Uyghur one).</P>
<P>And the German one can help make a funny joke in presentations when there are Germans in the room. :-)</P>
<P>It is really just people like Thomas Milo and I who seem to&nbsp;express unhappiness about issues like <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/03/23/8331877.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/03/23/8331877.html"><STRONG>this one</STRONG></A>. Sigh...</P>

<p><strong>Jan Kuƒçera</strong> on 28 Feb 2010 4:33 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Edit: Reading again I see you have written you asked for both of them, but I will post this anyway: I am quite annoyed how Windows 7 decides which keybord layouts to install instead of installing what user selected (I don't think the previous Windows versions did it).</p>
<p>For example if I choosed Czech (QWERTY) layout even during the very first Windows installation, it comes up with both Czech and Czech (QWERTY), Czech set to default of course.</p>
<p>Oh and then comes this super crazy United States-International, which I think is installed if your installation choice is an US keyboard yet different locale.</p>
<p>I would be quite interested how such &quot;breaking&quot; changes can be commited or thought out at all! Or am I the one who is broken? :)</p>

<p><strong>Michael S.

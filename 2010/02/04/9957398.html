<P>I talked to some people after people noted that the Text Services Framework samples disappeared.</P>
<P>Thankfully between Lee and Lorin and Mason they were tracked down (apparently they got lost in the move from msdn2.microsoft.com to msdn.microsoft.com).</P>
<P>They had them put up in the <A href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/" mce_href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/">MSDN Code Gallery</A>, right <A href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/tsf" mce_href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/tsf">here</A>.</P>
<P>I probably should have posted this sooner, but you know how it is - I migrated my "to do" list and this was one of the things that got lost in the migration....</P>
<P><EM>By the way, this blog is a little light on meaningful information; I'll put another one up in ten minutes, if you can hang on as second!</EM></P>

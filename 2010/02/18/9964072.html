<P>It really has been over three years since I first wrote the blog <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/09/06/742073.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/09/06/742073.html"><STRONG>IsSortable() == false? Well, sometimes it may be lying....</STRONG></A> about the method that didn't work so well with Windows only cultures.</P>
<P>At the time, I talked to the testers and developers and program managers involved, and they all assured me this was being tracked for a fix in the first version where a fix was possible (i.e. no "red bits" issues).</P>
<P>And that would have been CLR v.4. Coming soon to a programmer near you.</P>
<P>They have fixed the problem there.</P>
<P>Not by adding the instance specific method I suggested, but by updating and reportedly sharing the tables between Windows and .Net.</P>
<P>I do not know if I fully understand the total plan on the sharing thing; an MVP I know explained it to me but I am not sure he knew exactly how to describe the solution either.</P>
<P>I suppose it will not be until new versions of Windows and .Net (5.0?) are out for everyone interested (mainly me, perhaps?) to be sure that the problem has been fixed for more than just the version. For the time being, I'll say <STRONG>fixed for now</STRONG>. :-)</P>

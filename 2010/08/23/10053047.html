<p>The other day, in response to <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2010/08/16/9972623.html" title="Farsi? Persian? You'll be getting some LIP about it either way"><strong>Farsi? Persian? You'll be getting some LIP about it either way</strong></a>,&nbsp;stillife&nbsp;had a very interesting response, excerpted here:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;"><em>I've been using (and loving) the LIPs since Windows XP. They are really useful for getting people who haven't mastered English yet to still be connected to the world (like my grandmother). So kudos to Microsoft. </em></span></p>
<p>Now I find&nbsp;the full&nbsp;response to be interesting for several different reasons.</p>
<p>For today I am just going to deal with one of them; other issues can be done on other days. :-)</p>
<p>The easiest part of this is the kudos part -- it is always nice to know when people find the work to be useful. </p>
<p>Not all languages necessarily get lots of feedback, and generally one only hears from people when one knows them or when they are unhappy about something, but a comment pointing out one of the basic and cool uses of Language Interface Packs is nice.</p>
<p>This is a usage that I wish was pushed more often -- especially for languages where this core idea should be kept in mind during the original localization phase (this is the kind of feedback that I would probably love to hear if I were involved with the actual localization in question, because it is a type of validation of goals that just can keep you happy to be working for the rest of whatever week you find out about it!</p>
<p>Now of course it is just short of the most awesome type of response -- hearing from that grandmother (or whoever is directly able to use the LIP and who enjoys it). </p>
<p>But for a Monday morning "pick me up" this is still pretty cool....</p>
<p>I'll get to giving some other examples of feedback in this area -- some positive and some the other kind -- soon. But if you are one of those Persian speakers who has tried out the LIP (in any version), what did you think, for yourself and/or for the people you know who may not know as much English? Do you agree with the feedback, or did you see problems?</p>

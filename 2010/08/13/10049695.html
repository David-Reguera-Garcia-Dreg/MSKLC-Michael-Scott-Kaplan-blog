<p><em>Happy Friday the 13th, everybody!</em></p>
<p>To help people get to the Unicode Technical Committee meeting, a link to a map was provided.</p>
<p>The map they chose was showing off the satellite imagery.</p>
<p>And since the meeting was at Microsoft this time, they decided to use Bing maps.</p>
<p>The map was something like the following:</p>
<p><img src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/map01.jpg" border="0" /></p>
<p>Now this map only had&nbsp;three real flaws in it:</p>
<ul>
<li>the buildings were not labelled correctly;</li>
<li>the street layout&nbsp;was not&nbsp;accurate;</li>
<li>the building layout wasn't really accurate either.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now the second and third problems were due to the fact that the image is many years old. Like before the buildings were torn down that I&nbsp;mentioned in <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/08/17/4424342.html" title="Alive and well, but more grown up"><strong>Alive and well, but more grown up</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The first point, I have no explanation for -- someone took the time to add labels that were wrong.</p>
<p>Now that is just freaking weird.</p>
<p>Maybe they should prioritize getting updated images of the Microsoft campus? :-)</p>
<p>But before we get to making too much of Bing's problems here, we should take a look at Google Maps (which was not linked to):</p>
<p><img src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/map02.jpg" border="0" /></p>
<p>Now I added the building names in red for comparison purposes, but the other labels come from Google Maps.</p>
<p>The satellite imagery is more up to date, which is nice. </p>
<p>Though the street layout is not in sync -- you can see examples of streets that appear to go right through buildings and through the soccer fields.</p>
<p>Of course if you get directions the map layout is used and thus the directions will be wrong. </p>
<p>Though if you are "lucky" you might be directed to drive right into the meeting.</p>
<p>Literally!</p>
<p>The place where we have been meeting is indeed right under one of these inaccurate streets.</p>
<p>It seems like both Google Maps and Bing Maps ought to get their act together here.</p>

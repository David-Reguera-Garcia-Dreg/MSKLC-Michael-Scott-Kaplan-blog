<h1>Will ICU at IUC? [redux!] Oct 18th-20th in Santa Clara</h1>

<p>I will be speaking at the 34th Internationalization and Unicode Conference in Santa Clara, CA, USA on October 18th-20th, 2010.</p>
<p>You can see the conference website <a href="http://www.unicodeconference.org/index.htm">here</a>.</p>
<p>My talks? well there are two right now.</p>
<p>One on Wednesday (<em>at the ever-popular "last day of the conference, right before lunch" slot!</em>)&nbsp;titled <a href="http://is.gd/e3tXn">Windows 7 Language Support &mdash; How Does it All Fit Together</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: small;">Microsoft's Windows 7 has 36 localized builds and 50 plus language interface packs (LIP),and supports 100's of different languages with new keyboards, fonts, and Unicode properties. The localized builds can come in many flavors -- Starter Edition, Home Basic, Home Premium, Business, Enterprise, and Ultimate. Besides the localized versions of Windows 7, there is also the support for creating and displaying content in many different languages. This presentation will sort out the different types of and levels of language support that can be found in each of these versions and how they all relate to each other. As a bonus, there will be a quick peek at how the (already shipped) .Net Framework 4.0 (finally!) has parity with language support with Windows 7, and gives a kind of roadmap for how things will likely be kept in sync in the future.</span></p>
<p>And the other also on Wednesday (in the even more popular "Last day of the conference, last talk of the day" slot!) titled <a href="http://is.gd/e3u4J">The Past, Present, and Future of Tamil in Unicode</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: small;">The encoding of Tamil within Unicode has been the subject of concern by many interested parties such as the government of Tamil Nadu for as long as it has been there. It has led to a proposal (built up over the last decade) to try to change the way that Unicode looks at Tamil, as a reflection of the way Tamils look at the language themselves. The culmination of this is an official acknowledgement of Unicode as the way to encode Tamil that is being released this very year. The broader issues of the view of languages and the "rights" of language owners will also be discussed in this case study of a language that has been both wronged and righted as few others have in modern times.</span></p>
<p><em>And yes, since the talk was submitted, that acknowledgment&nbsp;mentioned was released did happen - maybe&nbsp;I should get that sentence updated.</em>:-)</p>
<p>There may be another talk, depending on circumstances and such. It may even have its own topic, and abstract.</p>
<p>Or perhaps I'll&nbsp;be the first person to do a Chalk Talk at this conference?</p>
<p>It should be a lot of fun, and I'm very much looking forward to it. Hope to see you there, in fact!</p>

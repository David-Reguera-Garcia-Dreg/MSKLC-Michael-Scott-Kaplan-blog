<p>William asks via the Contact link:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">Michael,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">I use the US-Dvorak keyboard layout on a US-Windows XP Home Edition, and I share the machine with other people who use QWERTY.&nbsp; After boot the logon screen is correctly QWERTY, but if I log on, and then switch users, the logon screen is now Dvorak.&nbsp; Off the top of your head, do you know what would encourage XP to keep QWERTY for the logon screen no matter what?</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">I am sorry to bother you with this.&nbsp; I failed to find information on this problem with both Microsoft's support site and Google, but I thought you might have heard of it.&nbsp; I understand you aren't customer service personnel and will understand completely if you can't help.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">Thanks for an awesome blog,<br />-William</span></p>
<p>So I do wonder why so many people would rather use the "Contact" link than the "Suggestion Box"... the ratio is like almost 25 to 1 most of the time!</p>
<p>Anyway, the way to handle the keyboard layout of the logon screen is covered in the <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/11/13/9065195.html" title="Updating the keyboard list in the logon dialog"><strong>Updating the keyboard list in the logon dialog</strong></a>, with the assumed understanding that if you have a keyboard list containing <strong>only one item</strong> that there will be no list and that one item will be the one keyboard. The directions themselves haven't change nearly as much as you might imagine....</p>

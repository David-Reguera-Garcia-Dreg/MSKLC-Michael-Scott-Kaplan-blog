<h1>Strike TWO!</h1>

<p>There was a comment written by Doug Ewell to my July 21st blog (<a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2010/07/21/10036699.html" title="It is easy (and obnoxious) to claim &quot;size doesn't matter&quot; if one has the size everyone wants"><strong>It is easy (and obnoxious) to claim "size doesn't matter" if one has the size everyone wants</strong></a>) that disappeared. </p>
<p>I didn't delete it.</p>
<p>It just wasn't there one day.</p>
<p>Doug sent me mail about it, in fact:</p>
<p style="PADDING-LEFT: 60px; FONT-FAMILY: "><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;"><em>Michael,<br /><br /></em></span><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;"><em>I noticed that my second comment in response to your "size doesn't<br />matter" blog of July 21 appears to have been simply discarded.&nbsp; I<br />thought that was unfortunate.</em></span></p>
<p>Ugh. That is not how I want my blog to be run. I have a heavy hand at times but I don't ever want that kind of thing happening if I did not explicitly cause it happen.</p>
<p>Crap.</p>
<p>Or, to more formally describe what I will call this one?</p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large;"><strong>Strike One</strong>.</span></p>
<p>Then, a reply that I myself wrote to Carl's comment to my blog from August 5 (<a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2010/08/06/10045710.html" title="When terminology affects satisfaction"><strong>When terminology affects satisfaction</strong></a>), was a second example of a comment that disappeared.</p>
<p>Now this one in particular pissed me off a lot and if you will read Carl's comment I was responding to then you will almost certainly be able to guess why.</p>
<p>Eventually I may&nbsp;write an actual full blog on that issue, but I wanted&nbsp;to put in a comment right away and am distinctly uncomfortable with writing one now that might be different from the original one since that text now appears to be gone forever.</p>
<p>I have a formal name to describe this incident as well.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: x-large;">Strike Two.</span></strong></p>
<p>Now I am an old database guy, so the notion of <strong>DATA LOSS</strong> is the one thing best able to instill fear in me.</p>
<p>And to be honest among the many many thousands of comments in the thousands of blogs I have written, I have no way to know if there are more.</p>
<p>But I do know one thing -- in my version of this game, <strong>one out means game over</strong> and thus if another comment that I deem interesting or important disappears without a trace, then I will declare <strong>Strike Three</strong> and start looking for a new place to host the blog.</p>
<p>I don't mind this server, but as far as I am concerned the series of bugs in trackbacks amount to <strong>four or five foul tips</strong> so although it is&nbsp;still <strong>Strike Two</strong>, my patience is wearing thin.</p>
<p>If I choose to move to a new location I'll let you know where and whatever that third strike ended up being. But I truly hope it does not come to that....</p>

<p><strong>Igor Levicki</strong> on 16 Aug 2010 3:56 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>I have a habit of copying the comment before hitting the Post button.</p>
<p>I learned the hard way that posting a comment can fail, and for important and long comments I always back them up in a Notepad driven database :)</p>

<p><strong>Carl</strong> on 19 Aug 2010 4:29 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Sorry if my comment pissed you off! I would like to read your reply someday. I know you&#39;re a tech guy, not a business guy, so you&#39;re not really the guy I should be complaining to, I just felt like things could be simplified for consumers. </p>
<p>Keep up the good blogging!</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 19 Aug 2010 7:33 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Skip that, I have your comment, Carl. A reply will be happening next week some time....</p>

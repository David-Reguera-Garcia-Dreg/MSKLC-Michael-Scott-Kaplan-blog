<p>It wasn't me.</p>
<p>Well, this time it wasn't me.</p>
<p>I mean, yes, it was me in <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/01/20/357028.html" title="Every character has a story #4: U+feff (alternate title: UTF-8 is the BOM, dude!)"><strong>Every character has a story #4: U+feff (alternate title: UTF-8 is the BOM, dude!)</strong></a>, back in 2005.</p>
<p>And yes again, it was me in <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/03/11/8152232.html" title="Why are UTF-8 encoded Unix shell scripts *ever* written or edited in Notepad?"><strong>Why are UTF-8 encoded Unix shell scripts *ever* written or edited in Notepad?</strong></a>, back in 2008.</p>
<p>And yes, it was me yet again in <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2010/02/23/9967789.html" title="The game is over, people!"><strong>The game is over, people!</strong></a>, earlier this year.</p>
<p>It is all about that UTF-8 BOM thing that so many people hate.</p>
<p>But Murry (<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/murrays/">this</a> Murray) told me,&nbsp;near the end of the Unicode Technical Committee meeting, that&nbsp;I had my facts wrong about the UTF-8 detection algorithm added in Windows 2000 that is at the heart of <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/06/14/631016.html"><strong>Behind 'How to break Windows Notepad'</strong></a>.</p>
<p>According to him, RichEdit was first to do that sort of thing. Back in 1998.</p>
<p>And then Notepad followed suit soon after.</p>
<p>Now the Notepad code has&nbsp;at least one advantages over the RichEdit code -- as <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/04/22/2239345.html" title="The Notepad encoding detection issues keep coming up"><strong>The Notepad encoding detection issues keep coming up</strong></a>mentions in its Step 3, Notepad attempts to detect BOM-less UTF-8, which RichEdit does not do. Though unlike the Notepad code, its detection algorithm is not based on the 1998 RFC, so RichEdit may get to avoid turning supplementary character-based CESU-8 into a big bunch&nbsp;of U+fffd cottage cheese, instead just not detecting it as UTF-8 when it has no BOM.</p>
<p>So there is good and bad in there, one can pick one's poison.</p>
<p>Either way, Murray was quite clear on one point: he believed the UTF-8 BOM was not a controversial issue and that it was a documented, expected, and reasonable&nbsp;way to tag UTF-8 text.</p>
<p>So if anyone has not given&nbsp;up and still is unhappy about this, they know it isn't me -- I have never owned Notepad, never changed its UTF-8 detection or conversion code. While at the same time Murray has been in the RichEdit code longer than I have been at Microsoft!</p>
<p>It wasn't me. :-)</p>

<p>And I think at this point very few people (if any) argue if BOM is a &quot;reasonable way to tag UTF-8 text.&quot;</p>
<p>The main complaint is this: if you open a UTF-8 file without BOM, then don&#39;t add it.</p>
<p>But I also think that as a developer (my mom does not edit Linux scripts) one should be mature enough to choose the tools he likes. If you don&#39;t like Notepad, use something else and stop the BMW (as is &quot;Bitching, Moaning, and Whining&quot; :-)</p>

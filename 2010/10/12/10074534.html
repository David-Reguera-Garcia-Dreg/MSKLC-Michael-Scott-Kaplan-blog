<h1>Unicode 6.0.0 is [virtually] released!</h1>

<p>Yep, that's the deal -- Unicode 6.0 has been released!</p>
<p>You can check it out <a href="http://unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.0.0/">right here</a>....</p>
<p>Now of course the bug questions that come up next are when do we pick it up, when does Microsoft support it. For that, see the following blogs:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/12/23/506887.html" title="What Unicode version do you support?"><strong>What Unicode version do you support?</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/09/06/8928632.html" title="What version of Unicode should we support?"><strong>What version of Unicode should we support?</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2010/10/11/10073903.html" title="Unicode 5.2 and OpenType?"><strong>Unicode 5.2 and OpenType?</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>And of course keep in mind that we just shipped Windows 7 and Office 2010. BEFORE Unicode 6.0 came out. The comments in that last blog on the list about the non-synchronization between Unicode and Microsoft has just been given an <strong>epic</strong> example!</p>
<p>From the Unicode Announcement, titled: <strong>Unicode Version 6.0: Support for Popular Symbols in Asia</strong>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;">&nbsp; The newly finalized Unicode Version 6.0 adds 2,088 characters, with over <br />1,000 new symbols.<br /><br />A long-awaited feature of Unicode 6.0 is the encoding of&nbsp; hundreds of <br />symbols for mobile phones. These emoji characters are in widespread use, <br />especially in Japan, and have become an essential part of text messages <br />there and elsewhere. Unicode 6.0 now provides for data interchange between <br />different mobile vendors and across the internet. The symbols include <br />symbols for many domains: maps and transport, phases of the moon, UI symbols <br />(such as fast-forward) and many others.<br /><br />A late-breaking addition is the newly created official symbol for the Indian <br />rupee. With the help of the Indian government and our colleagues in ISO, the <br />consortium was able to accelerate the encoding process. Once computers and <br />mobile phones update to the new version of Unicode, people will be able to <br />use the rupee sign like they use $ or &euro; now.<br /><br />This October 2010 release includes the Unicode Character Database (UCD), <br />Unicode Standard Annexes (UAXes), and code charts. With the release of these <br />components, implementers are able update their software to Unicode 6.0 <br />without delay. The final text of the core specification will be available in <br />early 2011.<br /><br />* To access Unicode 6.0, see <a target="_blank" href="http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.0.0">http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.0.0</a>.<br /><br />* For more information on emoji, see <a target="_blank" href="http://unicode.org/faq/emoji_dingbats.html">http://unicode.org/faq/emoji_dingbats.html</a><br /><br />* For a formatted version of this message with images, see <br /><a target="_blank" href="http://unicode.org/press/pr-6.0.html">http://unicode.org/press/pr-6.0.html</a>.</p>
<p>Have at it.... :-)</p>
<p>But note the information I started this blog with: for new characters and scripts, there is no collation or font or property support yet. We don't have the ability to predict the future!</p>
<hr/><p><strong>Pavanaja U B</strong> on 12 Oct 2010 7:25 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Any idea for shipping some fonts including the new Indian Rupee symbol?</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 12 Oct 2010 9:24 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>You mean beyond the hundreds of fonts people have been putting out there over these last few months? :-)</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Pavanaja U B</strong> on 12 Oct 2010 10:00 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Most of the fonts put up by enthusiastic people on the web as soon as the new Indian Rupee symbol has been announced are TrueType fonts and not Unicode Opentype fonts. It is not practical to change the font every time I need the symbol. It will be better to add the Rupee symbol to atleast 4-5 major fonts like Arial, Times, Verdana, Tohama...</p>

<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 12 Oct 2010 5:53 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>You probably need to give people a little time here. It took a not insignificant number of years for India to decide on the sign, and it will take far less time for technology to help provide it for use....</p></div>
<p><strong>MS</strong> on 13 Oct 2010 6:36 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>I wonder why they felt the need to add things like &quot;MAN WITH TURBAN&quot; or &quot;DANCER&quot;. &nbsp;Seriously? &nbsp;Was there a huge demand for this?</p>
</div>
<p><strong>I love Micro$oft</strong> on 20 Jan 2011 5:10 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Michael $. Kaplan: &quot;...for new characters and scripts, there is no collation or font or property support yet. We don&#39;t have the ability to predict the future!&quot;</p>
<p>Micro$oft can&#39;t predict that Unicode will continue to release more of the world&#39;s characters? Or Micro$oft can&#39;t $ee it as a priority? I$n&#39;t the rea$on obviou$?</p>
<p>M$: Po$$ibly you will have problems with the Unicode philosophy, or any philosophy. Unle$$ it&#39;$ philo$ophy.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 20 Jan 2011 7:12 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Um, huh?</p>
<p>Microsoft can predict new scripts just fine. They can even know where they are proposed.</p>
<p>However, they cannot add them to fonts, collation tables, character property tables, and so on, prior to Unicode being released. So many things are subject to change!</p>
<p>Perhaps actually reading the other article might give more insight into the issues here, rather than anonymously trolling....</p>

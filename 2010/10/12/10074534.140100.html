<p>Yep, that's the deal -- Unicode 6.0 has been released!</p>
<p>You can check it out <a href="http://unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.0.0/">right here</a>....</p>
<p>Now of course the bug questions that come up next are when do we pick it up, when does Microsoft support it. For that, see the following blogs:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/12/23/506887.html" title="What Unicode version do you support?"><strong>What Unicode version do you support?</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/09/06/8928632.html" title="What version of Unicode should we support?"><strong>What version of Unicode should we support?</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2010/10/11/10073903.html" title="Unicode 5.2 and OpenType?"><strong>Unicode 5.2 and OpenType?</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>And of course keep in mind that we just shipped Windows 7 and Office 2010. BEFORE Uniucode 6.0 came out. The comments in that lkast blog on the list about the non-synchronization between Unicoe and Microsoft has just been given an <strong>epic</strong> example!</p>
<p>From the Unicode Announcement, titled: <strong>Unicode Version 6.0: Support for Popular Symbols in Asia</strong>:</p>
<p style="padding-left:90px">  The newly finalized Unicode Version 6.0 adds 2,088 characters, with over <br>1,000 new symbols.<br><br>A long-awaited feature of Unicode 6.0 is the encoding of  hundreds of <br>symbols for mobile phones. These emoji characters are in widespread use, <br>especially in Japan, and have become an essential part of text messages <br>there and elsewhere. Unicode 6.0 now provides for data interchange between <br>different mobile vendors and across the internet. The symbols include <br>symbols for many domains: maps and transport, phases of the moon, UI symbols <br>(such as fast-forward) and many others.<br><br>A late-breaking addition is the newly created official symbol for the Indian <br>rupee. With the help of the Indian government and our colleagues in ISO, the <br>consortium was able to accelerate the encoding process. Once computers and <br>mobile phones update to the new version of Unicode, people will be able to <br>use the rupee sign like they use $ or € now.<br><br>This October 2010 release includes the Unicode Character Database (UCD), <br>Unicode Standard Annexes (UAXes), and code charts. With the release of these <br>components, implementers are able update their software to Unicode 6.0 <br>without delay. The final text of the core specification will be available in <br>early 2011.<br><br>* To access Unicode 6.0, see <a href="http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.0.0">http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.0.0</a>.<br><br>* For more information on emoji, see <a href="http://unicode.org/faq/emoji_dingbats.html">http://unicode.org/faq/emoji_dingbats.html</a><br><br>* For a formatted version of this message with images, see <br><a href="http://unicode.org/press/pr-6.0.html">http://unicode.org/press/pr-6.0.html</a>.</p>
<p>Have at it.... :-)</p>
<p>But note the information I started this blog with: for new characters and scripts, there is no collation or font or property support yet. We don't have the ability to predict the future!</p>

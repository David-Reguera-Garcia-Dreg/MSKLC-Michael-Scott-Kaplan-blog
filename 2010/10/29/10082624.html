<h1>Sorting my kind of vegetarianism (lacto baconarianism) all out</h1>

<p><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">This post is so not technical. Please skip if you don't care for the blogs that aren't about technology!</span></em></p>
<p>I am not a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegan">Vegan</a>.</p>
<p><em><span style="font-size: xx-small;">I am also not a </span></em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vega"><em><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Vegan</span></em></a><em><span style="font-size: xx-small;">, but were it not for speed of light issues maybe I'd spend more time there. That is a topic for another day....</span></em></p>
<p>You see, the Wikipedia definition perhaps helps put it in context:</p>
<p style="PADDING-LEFT: 60px"><em style="FONT-FAMILY: "><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">Veganism is a philosophy and lifestyle whose adherents seek to exclude the use of animals for food, clothing, or any other purpose.</span></em></p>
<p>Now I not only have colleagues and former colleagues who are Vegans, but I also have several friends and even a few people I admire.</p>
<p>But it is just not me.</p>
<p>Some of that group I referred to above respect that, some tolerate it, and others are unaware and couldn't care less. It is a nice, wide&nbsp;range of reactions. :-)</p>
<p>Now I am also not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarian">vegetarian</a>.</p>
<p>To be honest there have been times that I have been a vegetarian -- specifically periods of time that I was variously a vegetarian, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pescetarianism">pescetarian</a>, a pollotarian, and an&nbsp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovo-lacto_vegetarianism">ovo-lacto vegetarian</a>.</p>
<p>In each of those cases, it was the fact that the person I was dating was that specific type of vegetarian or semi-vegetarian. Because when they were, I kind of was too. It is really all you can do if you want to spend time with them....</p>
<p>To be honest, I could probably be a vegetarian on my own merits, were it not for just a few basic issues, parts of my life that I find very difficult to do without:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatburger">Fatburger</a> about once every three months, a habit I picked up from Cathy;</li>
<li>A lot of chicken, usually in Americanized dishes claiming to be Thai food like panang curry with chicken and spicy crispy chicken -- this is probably the staple in my diet;</li>
<li>Bacon.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now if I didn't do the Fatburger I'd probably live, and the main appeal to the chicken for me is really&nbsp;the spices around it; whether I can substitute something else there depends on whether I can find a version of tofu I don't hate at that moment.</p>
<p>And I really do generally hate tofu. Sorry.</p>
<p>These two workarounds are generally the ones I use for my first two guilty pleasures on the list, when dating vegetarians who aren't pollotarians.</p>
<p>This just leaves one thing.</p>
<p>Bacon.</p>
<p>Now being raised a conservative Jew who was briefly an orthodox one (and a strong Dresnerian advocate)&nbsp;before retreating into a cynical kind of&nbsp;agnosticism, the idea of not eating bacon should not be so hard to contemplate.</p>
<p>And yet I really find that bacon is something I need pretty regularly.</p>
<p>Not every day or anything like that.</p>
<p>But now and then, on a somewhat regular basis, I find myself really wanting bacon.</p>
<p>Needing bacon.</p>
<p>And now I am going to point out a company I really like: <a href="http://baconforever.com/">Bacon Forever</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer: this blog and this reference does not represent a paid endorsement, but they did send me a t-shirt as a thanks for being a "beta tester" of their web site before it formally opens on November 15th. The t-shirt did not influence me to do or say anything I wouldn't have done anyway.</strong></p>
<p>There are two products of Chris and Tina, the folks behind Bacon Forever, whose products I first saw at the Fremont Sunday Market, that grab me in particular:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.baconforever.com/Bacon-Jerky-6-oz-/Hot-N-Spicy-Bacon-Jerky-6-oz-p39.html">Hot 'n Spicy Bacon Jerky</a> -- for when I just really want something spicy, and</li>
<li><a href="http://www.baconforever.com/Bacon-amp-Chocolate/Chocolate-Dipped-Bacon-4-oz-p28.html">Chocolate-Dipped Bacon</a>-- because between this product and Limonata I know that we are able to make the universe a better place by being here and contributing!</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps one day I will be a Vegetarian for real, graduating from my <strong>flex lacto pollo baconarian</strong> type of vegetarianism to a <strong>lacto-baconarian</strong> type of vegetarianism (how else to allow for the Chocolate-Dipped Bacon?), and in truth I may well be heading in that direction now.</p>
<p>We each have to make our choices, right? This may even be not entirely incompatible with some future semi-vegetarian I date, though I will try not to assume too much there....</p>

<p>As a meat substitute, tofu can only ever disappoint. As a food in its own right with recipes that use it deliberately, it can satisfy, even excel.</p>
<p>I spent a week in a Buddhist temple (well, pretty much a hotel, really) in Japan, eating the same food as the monks (though I suspect that they ate much less fancy dishes than the guests on most days), i.e. vegetarian. Tofu was a major ingredient in many dishes, and it was truly delicious. If I had the skill and time to prepare it like that every day, I would not find it hard to become a vegetarian at all.</p>

I could not believe my eyes: their scrambled eggs for breakfast was full of bacon. They showed me the package: this was vegetarian bacon they smartly brought with them. I still don&#39;t understand these people: if you cannot give up the taste of it, why go for chemical substitutes? As the Yiddish proverb goes, &quot;אז מען עסט חזיר, זול רינען איבער די בארד&quot;.</p>

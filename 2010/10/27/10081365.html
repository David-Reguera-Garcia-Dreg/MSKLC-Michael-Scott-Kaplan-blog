<p>I think maybe I should just start randomly going to the microsoft.com website and adding suffixes I find interesting to see what comes up.</p>
<p>Because every time I turn around, someone is telling me about some link that has been around for a while to tell me about some exciting new content!</p>
<p>Like over on the <strong>Local Language Program</strong> site.</p>
<p>There's a <strong>Local Language Program</strong> site?</p>
<p>Maybe I knew that at some point.... I am sure I should have known that.</p>
<p>Well, I know it now!</p>
<p>Anyway, they have cool new videos <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/llp">there on the site</a>, one about M훮ori, and the other about Vietnamese.</p>
<p>The quote in the title&nbsp;comes up at about 1:47 on the M훮ori video. And really both videos contain some interesting info about how several different native speakers look at their language, at Microsoft products, and of course at having Microsoft products in their language.</p>
<p>You can look at the other videos too, though perhaps you have already seen them and the new ones are the only ones you'd have to look at. :-)</p>
<p>Either way, I also put the link to the site on my "Microsoft Links" here on the side of the blog.</p>
<p>For those of you wanting to know more about what's behind the LIPs, you may want to check out some of these videos....</p>

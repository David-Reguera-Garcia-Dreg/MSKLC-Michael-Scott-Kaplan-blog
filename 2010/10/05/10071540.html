<h1>English becomes Europe's second language. Or maybe not so much...</h1>

<p>So I read the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/8041916/English-becomes-Europes-second-language.html">English becomes Europe's second language</a> story from the Telegraph.</p>
<p>Of course the title was a bit sensationalistic, since that isn't really what happened....</p>
<p>The subtitle explains what the story was really going to say.</p>
<p>Rather than:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">English becomes Europe's second language</span></p>
<p>The subtitle said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">English has become Europe's second language of choice with two thirds of people in the continent able to speak it, according to a survey.</span></p>
<p>Now that is a fairly large difference!</p>
<p>The article goes on a bit further to stir the pot with some more kind of incendiary text:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">The study found that English is the first foreign language studied in secondary schools in every country outside Britain and Ireland. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">The results of the survey are a particular blow to the French, who recently launched a failed bid for their language to be made the sole official language of the EU headquarters in Brussels, claiming their mother tongue was "more precise". </span></p>
<p>Now I suppose I could go on, but you should probably read it yourself if you want to see some good old fashioned muckraking.</p>
<p>No, I'll do a little more:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">It has also prompted calls for the EU to cut back on the &pound;1 billion it spends every year translating official documents into the organisation's 23 recognised languages. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">A spokesman for the Foreign Office said: "It's only right that the EU institutions think carefully about every penny they spend to ensure that they're getting the most from their money. </span></p>
<p>Though there is some truth in the article, I guess I'd be more impressed if a non-English speaking country were having <strong>its</strong> foreign office making the statements. And if so many different issues were given the clear timeline of a full story instead of a bit of sensationalistic fluff.</p>
<p>On the other hand, this is&nbsp;a sign of the times... or rather, The Telegraph.... :-)</p>

<p><strong>jmdesp</strong> on 11 Oct 2010 5:37 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>The EU is becoming more and more monolingual, I don&#39;t know what they&#39;re supposed to be talking about with that &quot;failed bid&quot;, the truth is that 20 years ago, in Brussels the number of documents written in English was only slightly ahead of the number in French, but today it&#39;s more than 75% English, a tiny minority in French, and the other languages almost non existent.</p>
<p>English is becoming *the* language of the EU institutions. But how can a single language represent the view of the 27 members of the EU, when it&#39;s the official language of only two of it&#39;s member(*), and what&#39;s more, one the two seems to seldom restrain from despising the EU ?</p>
<p>The EU is multi-cultural, and multi-lingual, and this state of affairs can only make it more distant from the citizens. My own country France unfortunately has quite some responsibility for this evolution, because when it&#39;s language enjoyed a privileged status in the EU, it hasn&#39;t been smart enough to see long ahead and tried to keep that status instead of helping more languages to be properly represented in the EU, therefore making itself a target for all the other countries that saw no good reason for that privilege, resulting in English staying the only day-to-day communication language in Brussels.</p>
<p>This results with EU institutions that make no effort to speak multiple language, and where as reported recently on a french journalist&#39;s blog, a north African journalist can call a collaborator of the EU&#39;s foreign affairs policy chief, suggesting French is the foreign language he handles best, and get the answer that : « We&#39;re Englishmen and speak only English ». </p>
<p>(*) OK, right, it&#39;s also an official language for a third one, but that&#39;s just 400 thousand people.</p>

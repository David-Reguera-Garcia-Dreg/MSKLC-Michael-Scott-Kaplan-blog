<h1>English becomes Europe's second language. Or maybe not so much...</h1>

<p>So I read the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/8041916/English-becomes-Europes-second-language.html">English becomes Europe's second language</a> story from the Telegraph.</p>
 <p>Of course the title was a bit sensationalistic, since that isn't really what happened....</p>
 <p>The subtitle explains what the story was really going to say.</p>
 <p>Rather than:</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">English becomes Europe's second language</span></p>
 <p>The subtitle said:</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">English has become Europe's second language of choice with two thirds of people in the continent able to speak it, according to a survey.</span></p>
 <p>Now that is a fairly large difference!</p>
 <p>The article goes on a bit further to stir the pot with some more kind of incendiary text:</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">The study found that English is the first foreign language studied in secondary schools in every country outside Britain and Ireland. </span></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">The results of the survey are a particular blow to the French, who recently launched a failed bid for their language to be made the sole official language of the EU headquarters in Brussels, claiming their mother tongue was "more precise". </span></p>
 <p>Now I suppose I could go on, but you should probably read it yourself if you want to see some good old fashioned muckraking.</p>
 <p>No, I'll do a little more:</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">It has also prompted calls for the EU to cut back on the &pound;1 billion it spends every year translating official documents into the organisation's 23 recognised languages. </span></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">A spokesman for the Foreign Office said: "It's only right that the EU institutions think carefully about every penny they spend to ensure that they're getting the most from their money. </span></p>
 <p>Though there is some truth in the article, I guess I'd be more impressed if a non-English speaking country were having <strong>it's</strong> foreign office making the statements. And if so many different issues were given the clear timeline of a full story instead of a bit of sensationalistic fluff.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, this is&nbsp;a sign of the times... or rather, The Telegraph.... :-)</p>

<h1>The messy concept of the LIPs from when XP was LIP-less</h1>

<p>Sometimes, our documentation can be confusing.</p>
<p>Like for example, take <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb457045.aspx">Comparing Windows XP Professional Multilingual Options</a>, and the text/tables from Appendix A and Appendix B. These tables have managed to confuse many people.</p>
<p>I'll provide&nbsp;them here:</p>
<h3 style="padding-left: 90px;">Appendix A: Localized Versions of Windows XP Professional</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;">There are 24 fully localized versions of Windows XP Professional.</p>

<p>Now really all they were trying to convey was that the last CD of the MUI&nbsp;version of XP (which came on several CDs) contained these nine languages that were not like the others that were also available separately as localized versions.</p>
<p>They were also smaller than the other 24, and could rightfully be considered "Language Interface Packs before Language Interface Packs actually existed".</p>
<p>In fact, once LIPs did exist, a few years after this was written (ref: <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/02/10/370460.html" title="Microsoft, you giving us some LIP?"><strong>Microsoft, you giving us some LIP?</strong></a>), these nine "partial MUI packs" became LIPs!</p>
<p>These nine "MUI languages" became the only ones that one could find a way to download for Windows XP when one searched around the web.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Now this of course confused a lot of people later.</p>
<p>Even though before LIPs existed, these nine MUI packs were just as difficult to get as the others.</p>
<p>I guess we can blame it on some&nbsp;sloppy definitions&nbsp;in the model that led to a bit of confusion (if you want real confusion, take that last XP MUI CD and install one of these languages and then try and install the corresponding LIP!).</p>
<p>Of course removing the whole <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb457045.aspx">Comparing Windows XP Professional Multilingual Options</a>&nbsp;white paper would make very little sense, since there is a lot of other information in it that is not confusing.</p>
<p>Editing a 7-year-old white paper can also be a little tricky (it probably should have been edited back in 2005 when the model was changed to allow for LIPs).</p>
<p>Hopefully something can be done; if not it will just continue to confuse people....</p>

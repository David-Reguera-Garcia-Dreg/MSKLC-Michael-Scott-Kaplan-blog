<p>Back in the end of August, president of the Unicode Consortium, Google engineer, and all around nice guy Mark Davis broke radio silence on his twitter account and <a href="http://twitter.com/mark_e_davis/status/22673110887">tweeted</a> the following:</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/mark_e_davis/status/22673110887" title="At Google, we've been tracking the growth of Unicode, http://goo.gl/IXDR. On 8/19, a new milestone: &gt;50% of the web in Unicode."><img src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/unicodepercent.jpg" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;That link is to the older article on the Google Blog (<a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/unicode-nearing-50-of-web.html">Unicode nearing 50% of the web</a>) from January of this year.</p>
<p>Now everyone repeated this and you can see the "25 retweets" annotation. It sounds like really big news, and very cool.</p>
<p>I've decided that I am not really all that impressed.</p>
<p>Sorry, Mark.</p>
<p>I should explain why I am not impressed.</p>
<p>First, I'll grab another tweet that has one of those stats of the type you hear all the time from Google exec types, this time mentioned by nomad411, someone else I follow in a <a href="http://twitter.com/nomad411/status/24284376556">tweet</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/nomad411/status/24284376556" title="&ldquo;@lizostroff: More data will be created in the next 4 years than the history of the planet #pcmtl&rdquo;"><img src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/internetdata.jpg" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Now one can obviously presume that Google has everything on the Internet indexed. They say they do.</p>
<p>And obviously this quote isn't specifically talking about the Internet (though similar quotes from Google execs that this quote reminds me of often do!).</p>
<p>So,&nbsp;in an environment that claims that the amount of data will be literally <strong>more than doubled in 48 months</strong>, the fact that it&nbsp;really takes <strong>seven months </strong>to go from "just under 50%" to "just over 50%" (a time frame that by using these rough numbers would mean that there is perhaps a ~14% increase in the data on the Internet, so the fact that we only moved a few percentage points on the Unicode side seems worrying).</p>
<p>Why is so much of the data being created today on the Interent&nbsp;not in Unicode?</p>
<p><em>Note that ASCII is UTF-8, etc.</em></p>
<p>This seems a much more interesting question for Google to spend time on, so they can move more of the web -- why not a blog pointing out the nature of the new data that isn't using Unicode?</p>
<hr/><p><strong>John Cowan</strong> on 19 Sep 2010 8:01 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>The figure for UTF-8 excludes pure ASCII. &nbsp;Pretty much what we&#39;ve got now, according to Google, is 50% UTF-8, 20% pure ASCII, 20% Latin-1 (including Windows-1252, 8859-15, etc.), and 10% Other.</p>
<p>I expect a lot of that new data is mainly digits in relational databases.</p>

<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 19 Sep 2010 8:30 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>I&#39;d love to see details on the other data, rather than assuming/expecting what it may be....</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 19 Sep 2010 4:53 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Also, this is one of those cases where labels vs. content can be interesting -- knowing who is st least claiming to be using UTF-8 helps one know what % of the web is using Unicode without punishing the people who use English....</p>
</div>
<p><strong>greenlight</strong> on 20 Sep 2010 3:53 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Well by &quot;data&quot; they could mean video and images, which obviously won&#39;t be in Unicode, and also takes up much more &quot;space&quot; and would count for a lot more than text (even if that text were in UTF-16 ;))</p>
</div>
<p><strong>parkrrrr</strong> on 20 Sep 2010 6:49 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>I want to know what fraction of the web is really UTF-8 but has a header that claims it&#39;s ISO 8859-1. Based on my personal experience, I&#39;ll bet it&#39;s pretty high.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 20 Sep 2010 7:00 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>That&#39;s what I mean -- the Google Blog article is a puff piece. Why not answer useful, interesting questions? :-)</p>

<p><strong>kasey</strong> on 11 Nov 2010 8:55 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Is there a way I can use Unicode to use certain letters/symbols, variations to construct my own language and be able to (type it out on word document) *** I know a lot about linguistics, its my career, lol, but when it comes to technology and/or computers I basically have 1% knowledge about them (comps) pls email me if u have the answer or any other solution, I can make my own letters easy, but I wan2 b able to use the comp, billy742001 at yahoo dot kom</p>

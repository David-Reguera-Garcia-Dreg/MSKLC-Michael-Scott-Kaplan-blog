<p>It all started with <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2010/09/03/10057586.html" title="I knew where Nepal was before Raiders of the Lost Ark. Did you?"><strong>I knew where Nepal was before Raiders of the Lost Ark. Did you?</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Well, actually, in a comment to it, from friend and regular reader, Pavanaja U B:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;"><em>Thanks that MS is now releasing both 64 and 32 bit versions. I wish Kannada LIP was last in the list and not first so that I could have got 64 bit version. Any chance of releasing 64 bit versions of previously released LIPs which were only 32 bit?</em></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;"><em>Regards,<br />Pavanaja</em></span></p>
<p>Now it is true that the LIPs that came early did have the one drawback that the new plan I discussed in <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2010/07/28/10043258.html" title="Reporting on 64 bits of awesomesauce"><strong>Reporting on 64 bits of awesomesauce</strong></a> was going to take a little bit to catch up and release the 64-bit versions to sit alongside the 32-bit ones. As I mentioned:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">The bad news is that the LIPs that have been released as 32-bit versions only will have to wait for a bit before the media verification can happen and their 64-bit counterparts can be released. They will be coming, but it will be a bit. If there were some other way it would happen sooner, but all of these work items are on a very tight schedule and the new work items can only be added when time can be found.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">But I can report that everyone does want to see it happen and that it will eventually happen! </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">I promise that I will keep interested readers posted about this as more details become available. :-)</span></p>
<p>Anyway, do you know what has been happening?</p>
<p>They have been putting up the 64-bit versions of these LIPs as soon as the verification happened, and many of them are now up. Including <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=a1a48de1-e264-48d6-8439-ab7139c9c14d&amp;displaylang=ta">Tamil</a> and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=a1a48de1-e264-48d6-8439-ab7139c9c14d&amp;displaylang=kn">Kannada</a>!</p>
<p>Not not every single one of them is up yet but they will be coming , with more and more making it up all the time. So if you are waiting for your preferred language, just check it out and see if it is there. If not then it will be soon.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

Translation quality is far better compared top that of XP LIP. I could locate that at some places better words/phrases could have been used. One major issue is that the English letters look very small small now. Over all, good going.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p><strong>Prasanna</strong> on 12 Sep 2010 10:37 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Wow, This is great...I remember having sent a request to both MSFT &amp; Google to enable transliteration for Kannada on 64-bit Windows 7.</p>
<p>Now with the Kannada LIP ready for Win7 64-bit, we are going to have some good time. Downloading it right away and feedback to follow.</p>
<p>Kudos to MSFT for having released it.</p>

The English letters look too small. Anything can be done to change that? Can I use some other font for English only?</p>

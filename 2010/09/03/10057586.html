<p>A LITTLE BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON NEPALI:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>NUMBER OF SPEAKERS</strong>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">20 million speakers worldwide</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>NAME IN THE LANGUAGE ITSELF</strong>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-size: x-large;">नेपाली</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Nepali (sometimes also referred to as "Nepalese") is the official language of Nepal where it is spoken by 11 million people as a mother tongue and by about 2 million people as a second language. Nepali is spoken indigenously over most of western Nepal, then progressively less further to the east.&nbsp; It is related to Hindi but has borrowed fewer words from Persian and English (instead using more Sanskrit derivations) and it has been influenced by the neighboring Tibeto-Burman languages. </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Nepali is also official language in the Indian state of Sikkim and is spoken by substantial minorities in parts of Assam West Bengal (around Darjeeling) and in the country Bhutan. </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Interesting features of the language include the socio-linguistically complex pronouns (there are different forms depending on the social status of the person spoken to or of) and the existence of parallel negative conjugations of verbs.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>FUN FACT</strong>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Nepali developed a significant literature within a short period of hundred years in the nineteenth century. The contribution of trio-laureates Poudyal, Devkota, and Sama took Nepali to the level of other world languages. The contribution of expatriate writers outside Nepal -- especially in Darjeeling and Varanasi -- is also notable.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>CLASSIFICATION</strong>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Nepali belongs to the so-called Pahari languages (including, for example, Hindi), a group of Indo-Aryan languages spoken in the lower elevations of the Himalaya which belong to the Indo-European language family. </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>SCRIPT</strong>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Nepali is written in Devanagari script (which is also used for Hindi, Marathi, and several other languages).</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p><strong>Pavanaja U B</strong> on 3 Sep 2010 9:33 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Thanks that MS is now releasing both 64 and 32 bit versions. I wish Kannada LIP was last in the list and not first so that I could have got 64 bit version. Any chance of releasing 64 bit versions of previously released LIPs which were only 32 bit?</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

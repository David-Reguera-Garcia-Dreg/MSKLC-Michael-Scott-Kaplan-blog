<P>You knew it was going to happen.</P>
<P>It was inevitable.</P>
<P>But like in a good way.</P>
<P>The Kannada Language Interface Pack for Windows 7 is now available!</P>
<P>Currently only in 32-bit, and you must have English resources for language fallback.</P>
<P>You can download it from <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=a1a48de1-e264-48d6-8439-ab7139c9c14d&amp;displaylang=kn" mce_href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=a1a48de1-e264-48d6-8439-ab7139c9c14d&amp;displaylang=kn">right here</A>....</P>
<P>The Kannada Windows 7 LIP is produced as part of the Local Language Program sponsored by Public Sector. </P>
<P>And now a little background information about Kannada:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>NUMBER OF SPEAKERS:&nbsp; </STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>45 million speakers</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>NAME IN THE LANGUAGE ITSELF:</STRONG> </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=5>ಕನ್ನಡ&nbsp;&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P>Kannada is the state language of Karnataka, where it is mainly spoken, and one of India's many official languages. Sometimes also called Kanarese, Kannada is one of the Dravidian languages spoken in the South of India. It has about 20 dialects which can differ considerably, though the written form is rather consistent throughout.</P>
<P><STRONG>FUN FACTS: </STRONG></P>
<UL>
<LI>Works of Kannada literature have received seven Jnanpith awards, which is the highest number awarded for the literature in any Indian language.</LI>
<LI>Several transliteration schemes/tools are used to type Kannada characters using a standard keyboard. Nudi, the government of Karnataka's standard for Kannada Input, is a phonetic layout loosely based on transliteration.</LI>
<LI>Kannada has a non-trivial number of loan words from Sanskrit and Marathi, by report many relate to feudalism and militia.</LI>
<LI>The language (and script) is almost perfectly phonetic, but for the sound of a "half n" (which becomes a half m).</LI>
<LI>A few letters have dropped out of the language over the years:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>ಱ ('ṟ' or 'rh'), which dropped out in the 12th century. Later Kannada works replaced 'rh' with ರ (ra)</LI>
<LI>ೞ ('ḻ', 'lh' or 'zh'), which dropped out in the 18th century. Later Kannada works replaced 'lh' with ಳ (la) </LI>
<LI>(&nbsp;'nh' or 'inn'), which as observed until the 1980s. This letter has been replaced by ನ್ (consonant n)</LI></UL></UL>
<P><STRONG>CLASSIFICATION: </STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Kannada, together with Tamil, Malayalam and others, belongs to the Southern group of the Dravidian languages. These form a language family on its own. Its languages are spoken on the Indian subcontinent, but are not related at all to Indic languages of the Indo-European family (like Hindi): The Dravidian languages are agglutinative (Words are formed by joining morphemes together) and have the interesting feature of an exclusive "we" (in which the addressee is not included).</P>
<P>To some this is known as "<STRONG>The Medical We</STRONG>", like in a doctor who says to the patient "How are we feeling, today?".</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>SCRIPT:</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><EM>Kannada</EM> is written in its own script, which is also called <EM>Kannada</EM>. The Kannada script is also used to write several other languages in Karnataka, such as Tulu, Kodava Takk, Beary bashe and Konkani.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

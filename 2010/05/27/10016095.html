<p>Yes, that's right, the <strong>Oriya Language Interface Pack for Windows 7</strong> is now available!</p>
<p>You can download it for any 32-bit Windows 7 install that contains English resources <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=a1a48de1-e264-48d6-8439-ab7139c9c14d&amp;displaylang=or">right here</a>....</p>
<p>The Oriya LIP is produced as a part of the Local Language Program, sponsored by Public Sector.</p>
<p>And for a little background information on Oriya:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NUMBER OF SPEAKERS</strong>:&nbsp; </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">31 million speakers in India</p>
<p><strong>NAME IN THE LANGUAGE ITSELF</strong>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: large;">ଓଡିଆ&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>Oriya is one of the official languages of India. About 90 percent of the speakers live in the state Orissa in the East of India, but there are also sizable communities in the neighboring states of West Bengal and Jharkand and, due to labor migration, also in Gujarat.</p>
<p><strong>FUN FACTS</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Oriya has a rich literary heritage dating back to the thirteenth century and has had a strong tradition of poetry.</li>
<li>There are many dialects of Oriya, some of which are considered separate languages by native speakers despite the claims of linguists.</li>
<li>It would seem that many people now refer to <strong>Orissa</strong> as <strong>Odissa</strong> or <strong>Odisha</strong>; given the spelling in the native language (<span style="font-size: small;">ଓଡିଶା</span> or O DDA I SHA AA) this does not seem entirely unreasonable. Microsoft has not caught up to that just yet.</li>
<li>Also, it would seem that many people now refer to <strong>Oriya</strong> as <strong>Odiya</strong> or <strong>Odia</strong>; given the spelling in the native language (<span style="font-size: small;">ଓଡିଆ</span> or O DDA I AA) this does also not seem entirely unreasonable. Microsoft has not caught up to that just yet, either.</li>
<li>A few bugs were reported for the download page for the LIP within hours of the announcement, which will hopefully be addressed soon. :-)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>CLASSIFICATION</strong>: </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Oriya is a member of the Eastern Indo-Aryan group of Indo-European languages. It is closely related to Bengali, Bihari and Assamese.</p>
<p><strong>SCRIPT</strong>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Oriya has its own script, an abugida with 35 characters. The Oriya script is also used by some smaller languages in Orissa state.</p>

<P><FONT color=#ff0000><EM>I guess you have to be there. In my head, I mean....</EM></FONT></P>
<P>So anyway, Afshar's question via the Contact Link was:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times">Hi Michael,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times">There is a good standard for Persian (Farsi) keyboard layout called ISIRI 9147 (former version was ISIRI 2901) but none versions of windows comply with it including Vista, XP, 98, 95. I always wonder why Microsoft&nbsp; doesn't like to use this standard and even more each version's keyboard layout is changing by new versions? ISIR stands for Institute Of Standards &amp; Industrial Research Of Iran (</FONT><A href="http://www.isiri.org/"><FONT face="times new roman,times">http://www.isiri.org/</FONT></A><FONT face="times new roman,times">). ISIRI in Iran is something like ANSI in U.S.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times">I am a Persian (Farsi) user of MS Windows and an i18n interested C# developer.&nbsp; I'm very pleased to help on this issue if I can. Please let me know if I can do anything.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times">afshar</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>And there was another, similar note from Nasser as well:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times"><EM>Dear Kaplan, Michael<BR>As I Know you are a real good connector between microsoft and developers, I want to ask you to do something for me.<BR>I Live in Iran and I always like to work with standard application. Microsoft is going to finalize Windows 7 and we want microsoft to implement a standard Keyboard Layout for Iran. Now in all windows versions (2008,vista,xp,etc) microsoft provides a keyboard layout for Farsi that is not a standard one.<BR>The Institute of Standards &amp; Industrial Research of Iran had announced two keyboard layouts: one ISIRI 2901 that realeased on about 13 years ago and the other one ISIRI 9147 that was the Persian Keyboard Layout version2 and released about 2 years ago.<BR>We want to ask from microsoft to implement this keyboard Layout (ISIRI 9147) into windows seven and other following Operating System like Midori or viseversa Please show us the best way to connect to microsoft to ask this from them, or connect us to them, or better than everything ask them to implement this keyboard layout into windows.</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times"><EM>FarsiWeb had implemented this layout and this layout is publicly available from here you can download it and use it but please do something for us, we use from a wide variety of unstandard application becouse of this bad kayboard layout that microsoft provided on windows.</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times"><EM>there is a good group on google formerly named Persian Computing there are some good guys that can be helpfull for you like Behdad Esfahbod and Rouzbeh PourNader that were in ISIRI 9147 implementation team.<BR>I am wonder if you help me, thank you so much , Nasser</EM></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Well, let me explain.</P>
<P>Microsoft does not have a subsidiary in Iran, and we don't sell software there. </P>
<P>We aren't allowed to, actually.</P>
<P>And while recent developments like <A href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/191018/us_lifts_iran_sudan_cuba_internet_services_export_ban.html" mce_href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/191018/us_lifts_iran_sudan_cuba_internet_services_export_ban.html">US Lifts Iran, Sudan, Cuba Internet Services Export Ban</A> are interesting (note that this had not yet happened when those two messages were sent to me), the meaning of these initial steps in terms of how companies would engage in reviewing or implementing standards in these countries is not entirely clear.</P>
<P>Note from the announcement that&nbsp;article links to:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>U.S. companies can now export instant messaging, e-mail and social-networking tools, blogging software, Web browsers and photo and movie sharing software, as long as the software is publicly available at no cost to the user, the Department of Treasury said in <A href="http://www.ustreas.gov/press/releases/tg577.htm" target=_blank>a press release</A>.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>It is unclear whether keyboards and such that only go into products that the new guidelines wouldn't cover (i.e. Windows) would in fact be included - I am not a lawyer, but it seems unlikely.</P>
<P>I know I wouldn't just randomly start doing the work before people a whole bunch of levels over me told me it was okay.</P>
<P>So I guess the direct answer to afshar and Nasser as to why Microsoft isn't looking at these standards would be that Microsoft (or at least the small part of it in which I sit!) hasn't been given the okay to be looking into supporting those things.</P>
<P>If and when that changes and Microsoft can more directly engage in-country, some aspects of our support (like LIPs and keyboards and locales and so on) can be targeted more to the new customers in threse markets made available, as opposed to the expatriate market that is the current primary focus....</P>

Michael Everson has a document commissioned by the United Nations, <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.evertype.com/standards/af/af-locales.pdf">http://www.evertype.com/standards/af/af-locales.pdf</a> , describing a keyboard layout for Afghanistan, based on ISIRI 2901. If there are no existing layouts shipped for Afghanistan, it would seem to me to be reasonable to take advantage of the work Michael (and Roozbeh Pournader) have done already.</p></div>
<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 11 May 2010 8:43 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Dari (aka Eastern Farsi) is not Persian, and there is no formal or AFAIK informal request to make the keyboards there based on an Iranian national standard. </p>
<p>I have spoken previously about problems with the Everson doc....</p>

<p><strong>Aidan Kehoe</strong> on 12 May 2010 1:30 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>I can't find anything from you on blogs.msdn.com mentioning Everson’s document. Maybe you posted it to the Unicode lists?</p>
<p>‘Persian’ and ’Farsi’ are in origin and in use the same word, it doesn’t make sense to say ‘Dari (aka Eastern Farsi) is not Persian’. Certainly, the Persian of Afghanistan has differences from Iranian Persian, some of them major. But the Iranians could certainly use a keyboard intended for Dari! :-)</p></div>

<p>Just as Iberian Portuguese is not Brazilian Portuguese, Dari in Afghanistan is not Persian in Iran, and support of languages of Iran and Iranian standards cannot be done, as I stated. </p>
<p>End of story, period.</p>

<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 12 May 2010 10:59 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Thank goodness someone understands. :-)</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Michael Everson</strong> on 13 May 2010 5:10 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>I've no idea what you mean about &quot;problems with the Everson doc&quot;. You'e never said anything to me about it. The Afghani keyboard specifications were designed to be compatible with the ISIRI keyboards (particularly as hardware keyboards in Afghanistan are likely to be sourced from Iran), so it is certainly the case that Persian speakers would be able to make some use of the Afghan Dari keyboard layout.</p>
<p>There are Persian speakers in the United States, who are citizens of the United States, and there have been for many years. I daresay they have worked hard, &nbsp;form some sort of market. </p></div>
<p><strong>Michael Everson</strong> on 13 May 2010 5:13 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>&quot;Providing ingformation that is CLDR/UCA/ISO keyboard based does not help enable it on Windows, which uses none of those things, something that he was told repeatedly, and ignored.&quot;</p>
<p>Rubbish. The Afghan documents show pictures of the keyboard layout. &quot;Put this letter on this key&quot;. That's pretty basic. I'm quite sure that Microsoft must have hired people who would be bright enough to work this out. </p></div>

<p><strong>Mohammad</strong> on 14 May 2010 11:35 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>I understand the legal concerns, but I seriously doubt that it will cause any problems, since exporting MS Windows to Iran is different from complying with an Iranian national standard (yes I know that has to be stated by a lawyer). Major open source operating systems (e.g. unix-based distributions) are already supporting ISIRI 9147 out-of-the-box.</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for considering this. I guess we have to contact some more senior Microsoft official. Can you direct us or our request to someone who can help? This will have a large impact on Persian support and standardization in computational environments and reducing our hassles.</p></div>
<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 14 May 2010 11:39 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Microsoft adopts national standards in large part through communication with and feedback from/to the provider of the standards -- which in this case means the ability to talk to the government. The impact is known and understood, but the limitations on people in a country caused by the government of that country are really a bit beyond reasonable scope for companies that aren't allowed to deal with the country....</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Mohammad</strong> on 14 May 2010 1:06 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Michael,</p>
<p>Assuming that standards compliance doesn't violate US Export Control regulations, communication with and feedback from/to the provider of the standards is perfectly possible, and there's no restriction from either governments (U.S. and Iran) imposed (see <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article6962844.ece">http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article6962844.ece</a> for an example related to public health). This is not to mention that the standard document is publicly available (in Persian) (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://isiri.org/std/9147.pdf">http://isiri.org/std/9147.pdf</a>) and it contains all information needed to comply with it.</p>
<p>Also the members of the committee who produced the standard are well-known people (mainly people at FarsiWeb Inc. and Sharif University), two of whom currently live in North America (Roozbeh Pournader and Behdad Esfahbod - search their names). They would be more than happy to help Microsoft implement the standard and they are *the ultimate* experts on the issue. They have tried to persuade Microsoft to do this at past with no avail (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.farsiweb.ir/wiki/Standard_Persian_keyboard">http://www.farsiweb.ir/wiki/Standard_Persian_keyboard</a>). I myself know the head of the committee (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://sharif.edu/~tabesh/">http://sharif.edu/~tabesh/</a>) in person and can help if more formal communication with ISIRI is needed.</p>
<p>As far as I am aware, there's probably nothing outside of Microsoft which may impede the adoption of the Persian standard keyboard layout.</p></div>
<p><strong>Ahmad</strong> on 14 May 2010 2:14 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Hello,</p>
<p>I prefer the Farsi keyboard standard that has already been used in Microsoft windows products. It's really handy and comfortable to me.</p>
<p>But there is something strange about Farsi language in Windows, the two letter code for Farsi is &quot;Fa&quot; but the language is called &quot;Persian&quot;!</p>
<p>Dear mans, the correct/modern name of this language is Farsi, Persian is an ancient name and is now outdated, so stop go on to use it!</p></div>
<p><strong>Mohammad</strong> on 14 May 2010 3:18 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>@Ahmadi</p>
<p>'Farsi' is not an English word, it's the 'Persian' word for 'Persian'. See <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farsi#Nomenclature">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farsi#Nomenclature</a></p>
<p>The link above also explains why the language code is 'fa' instead of 'pe'.</p>
<p>Also, the current Windows default keyboard doesn't have several of the characters in Persian, most importantly Persian numbers (you must have been so used to typing numbers in English!). If you compare the layouts, the 9147 standard is clearly richer and more suitable for Persian. The current one is mostly designed for Arabic, contributing to some bad practices in Persian typing and problems for search engines.</p></div>
<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 14 May 2010 5:45 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><P>Sigh.</P>
<P>Mohammad - The way that Microsoft within a market and with standards may not seem best to you in this case, but such policies are not developed on the back of a cocktail napkin, to be discarded for the sake of a market that one cannot even ship software into. It is a hard message, but please don't assume just because&nbsp;I am&nbsp;hearing someone describe a situation means that I can be magically convinced to adovcate such an arbitrary change based on no business model at all.</P>
<P>Ahmad - I discuss the issue with the name <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/05/23/604843.html"><STRONG>here</STRONG></A> and other places.</P></div>
<p><strong>Mohammad</strong> on 15 May 2010 2:58 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>@Michael</p>
<p>OK, I undertand! I was just trying to clarify. Thanks anyway.</p></div>
<p><strong>Ahmad</strong> on 15 May 2010 12:03 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Michael, I really like the way you get in touch with people and developers outside the company through this blog. I think the final users of a feature in a software product will always determine what it looks like and without a good interaction between developers and users, it may take a lot to software to fulfill the needs of user.</p>
<p>I’m sure the Microsoft will finally include the ISIRI standard as the second Farsi keyboard layout (Like EN-US which has several keyboard layouts) in Windows and wondering why people are trying to prove that the ISIRI standard is the only best, and must be substituted with the standard that people have already got used to it. I think these are the two standards.</p></div>
<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 15 May 2010 2:02 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Well, one never knows what may happen, but one interesting point is how enthusiastically some expats will defend the mother country's decisions (the &quot;Farsi&quot; vs. &quot;Persian&quot; thing is one example, the keyboard is another). Some things they will get, other things they won't. Because the process is not a healthy and open exchange with government and technology (as it is with almost the entire rest of the world).</p>
<p>I hope that can change one day, I truly do. Not just for this sake but for the sake of freedom for a lot of people. I think of a better Windows experience as a cherry on the ice cream sundae of that freedom. :-)</p>

<p><strong>CFynn</strong> on 7 Jun 2010 1:45 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Other languages / countries which don&#39;t have export restrictions from the U.S. are also missing keyboard layouts / locales.</p>
<p>e.g. What about Dzongkha / Bhutan? </p>

<p><strong>Aidan Kehoe</strong> on 11 Jun 2010 7:04 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>I&#39;ve put up the Afghan layouts described in Michael Everson and Rozzbeh Pournader&#39;s document in MSKLC source and binary format here: <a target="_new" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.parhasard.net/afghan-keyboard/">www.parhasard.net/afghan-keyboard</a> .

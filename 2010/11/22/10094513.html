<p><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">Disclaimer: The company I work for is a full member of Unicode and the provider of space for Unicode's home office, and I have been a full and associate member in the past.</span></em></p>
<p>I have never claimed to be a big fan of the emoji, in any of the times they have come up here, e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2010/04/27/10002948.html" title="Were it not for Emoji, this blog would look very different (and would have been unnecessary)"><strong>Were it not for Emoji, this blog would look very different (and would have been unnecessary)</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/08/18/4455146.html" title="Who are the heirs of Bernard R. Miller? (aka U+2323 when you say that!)"><strong>Who are the heirs of Bernard R. Miller? (aka U+2323 when you say that!)</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/09/15/4936526.html" title="Hindsight is 20/20 and DAGGER is U+2020, coincidence? (aka I miss emoji like the deserts miss the rain)"><strong>Hindsight is 20/20 and DAGGER is U+2020, coincidence? (aka I miss emoji like the deserts miss the rain)</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>and so on. I could go on, but the topic tends to&nbsp;drain me of a lot of energy. You can probably find more if yo0u are interested, though as goals go it isn't very exciting.</p>
<p>In the end, searching for blogs on some topics is a bit like the flaw in trying to pick people up at the nude beach (that flaw is that most people -- myself included -- look more attractive with clothes on than clothes off, the flaw in the task of finding good emoji blogs is not that there aren't any - though there aren't -- it is that once you have the blogs in hand you feel less clean, less good, less fulfilled.</p>
<p>Or maybe that's just me....</p>
<p>Anyway, the one thing the emoji, that thing which in&nbsp;my mind can make Unicode feel less about interesting language issues and more about how to build a clip art factory, is that it can appeal to others</p>
<p>If you need proof, see Adam Kuban's <a href="http://slice.seriouseats.com/archives/2010/11/unicode-60-includes-new-pizza-slice-character.html">Unicode 6.0 Includes New Pizza Slice Character</a> on "America's Favorite Pizza Weblog" <strong>Slice</strong>, which points to Typographer and pizza lover Nick Sherman's <a href="http://pizzarules.com/367">U+1F355: &ldquo;SLICE OF PIZZA&rdquo; character in Unicode 6.0</a> on his own <strong>Pizza Rules!</strong> Blog.</p>
<p>And suddenly see who the heirs of Bernard R. Miler might be.</p>
<p>Eventually some of these people who see so much more in the text than, well, <strong>the text</strong>, will be people affluent enough to join Unicode as members. </p>
<p>And perhaps one day they will even vote Unicode beyond the constraints it has created for itself in this regard. </p>
<p>I am reminded of a bit from an episode of The West Wing:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">You know, I never understand why you gun control people <br />don't all join the N.R.A. They've got two million members. <br />You bring three million to the next meeting... call a vote... <br />All those in favor of tossing guns - [Snaps fingers] - Bam! Move on.</span></p>
<p>I'm not saying it's necessarily a&nbsp;sensible strategy. </p>
<p>But it may cost less for the fans of Pizza to get some of their topping into Unicode than the NRA thing would cost people.... :-)</p>

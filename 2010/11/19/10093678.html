<p><em>Humming this variation on the song: You may know what its like to be held up, to be felt up, behind blue gloves...</em></p>
<p>The patdowns.</p>
<p>There is a lot in the news about the TSA patdowns.</p>
<p>I think about it, but for me it is old news.</p>
<p>As a guy in a wheelchair (and an iBot is a wheelchair no matter how cool people may think it is), I have been felt up by TSA on every flight I have taken.</p>
<p>I don't care for it,&nbsp;I find it to be kind of humiliating.</p>
<p>I'm not fond of radiation either, but I currently spend 6-18 hours a day sitting atop two NiCad batteries, so all I can say about radiation danger is <strong>ship sailed</strong>.</p>
<p>So I'd choose the humiliating dangerous&nbsp;scanner if they would let me, but they can't -- the scanner won't work on me.</p>
<p>So I endure being felt up by strangers behind blue gloves.</p>
<p>For me it is a little worse, interestingly enough.</p>
<p>Even though I am not currently given the "embarrass the living crap out of me intense patdown&nbsp;intended to embarrass me about not choosing the backscatter" patdown (presumably because I cannot even opt-in, which would make punishing me for opting out kind of stupid), the iBot itself gets some eyes on it. I remember the 6-year-old who asked his mom as she and he walked by me "Why are they doing that to him? That's a bad touch!" and it would be hard to say whether it was the mom or I who was more mortified.</p>
<p>So I get the eyes on me as if they were trying to shame me into backscattering.</p>
<p>Yet every time I go through I know the iBot distracts the TSA people too -- and I have to routinely point out to them the steps they have missed during the screening, steps involving the iBot itself.</p>
<p>The TSA agents are occasionally suspicious but more often grateful for the assist.</p>
<p>Sometimes they want to ask me about the iBot but I find myself drawing the line.</p>
<p>Total strangers who entreat me with questions about the iBot will get&nbsp;a tiny slice of my time, if they have time.</p>
<p>People I know can get a bit more if they want it.</p>
<p>People I am involved with get a much time as they want (though talking about the iBot does not put me in the mood, if you know what I mean).</p>
<p>But the stranger in the airport who&nbsp;feels me up while they wear blue gloves? He (or she -- it has&nbsp;sometimes been a she)&nbsp;got the cheap thrill. If intelligent conversation&nbsp;about&nbsp;my chair is also desired, I better be getting dinner out of it....&nbsp;</p>

<p>Umm, what radiation danger? &nbsp;Direct-current sources like batteries don&#39;t radiate.</p>

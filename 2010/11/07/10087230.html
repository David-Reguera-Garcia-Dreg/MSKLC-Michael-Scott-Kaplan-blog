<p>I didn't have any problems waking up at the time I thought I would be waking up.</p>
<p>You may not have been so lucky.</p>
<p>Though I had a few things in my favor:</p>
<ul>
<li>My own blog from last week (<a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2010/11/02/10084569.html" title="iOS &amp;lt;= 4.1: &amp;plusmn;1 hour from savoir faire?"><strong>iOS &lt;= 4.1: &plusmn;1 hour from savoir faire?</strong></a>) gave me, and perhaps you, ample warning, and</li>
<li>I don't use my mobile phone as my alarm clock anyway, and</li>
<li>I don't have an iPhone</li>
</ul>
<p>But perhaps you were not as lucky.</p>
<p>I also had some celebrities warning me about the problem in case I did have an iPhone and it was my alarm clock and I forgot about that blog last week:</p>

<p>Thanks Alyssa! :-)</p>
<p>A part of me was hoping that Apple would get a hotfix out sooner since pulling in the iOS 4.2 update sooner would have been so much harder. But I guess they decide they would rather just take the hit and have a little widespread bit of trouble in their biggest (or at least their loudest!) market.</p>
<p>Perhaps this will get Apple into that same mode about taking these issues more seriously that they have largely been able to avoid, which I think would be good thing, for everyone. Even though they are technically the competition, I haven't ever really viewed them in exactly that way, and even if I did I'd rather generate interest on the merits of my products, not depending on the screwups or mistakes of others.</p>
<p>But that's just me, I know that opinions will vary.</p>
<p>Anyway, hope you didn't find yourself up an hour late, and hope you have removed your recurring alarm for tomorrow if you have one, like the instructions request.</p>
<p>And finally, I hope the iOS 4.2 update doesn't brick your phone (a friend of mine said the 4.1 update had that effect on <strong>her</strong> phone, a rather abrupt way to prove to her in light of these DST issues the truth of the old truism <strong>better late than never</strong>)....</p>

<p>It&#39;s fall. So the clocks got moved back an hour. So if a particular clock [whether an iphone or an ordinary alarm clock] _failed_ to be moved back, it will claim it&#39;s [e.g.] 7:00 when the time is actually [moved back to] 6:00. So wouldn&#39;t you actually be getting up an hour early?</p>

Apple didn&#39;t *ever* update either iOS nor Mac OS X to all the DST mess in Argentina. I still have my iPod touch set to a different country that happens to have the correct UTC offset. And I got one hour late to somewhere twice (in different months, at the beginning and end of DST).</p>

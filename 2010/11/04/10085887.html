<p>A LITTLE BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON LUXEMBOURGISH:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>NUMBER OF SPEAKERS</strong>:&nbsp; </p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">~300,000</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>NAME IN THE LANGUAGE ITSELF</strong>: </p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">L&euml;tzebuergesch&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Luxembourgish is spoken in the small Western European country of Luxembourg where it is official language since 1984 (together with French and German). Though so closely related to German (see "Classification") that German speakers should have no major problems understanding Luxembourgish, the differences between the two languages in terms of grammar are considerable. Luxembourgish has also borrowed many words from French (from merci for thank you to Prabbeli from parapluie for umbrella).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>INTERESTING FACT</strong>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Though Luxembourg is founding member of the European Union, Luxembourgish is not an official language of the EU. In Luxembourg itself laws are not published in Luxembourgish either.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>CLASSIFICATION</strong>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Strictly linguistically spoken, Luxembourgish is a West Central German dialect - but due to its standing it can be considered a language on its own (As the saying goes, "A language is a dialect with an army".) Luxembourgish as a Germanic language belongs to the family of Indo-European languages.).&nbsp; </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>SCRIPT</strong>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Luxembourgish is written in Latin script. There are four special characters: &eacute;, &auml;, &euml; and &uuml;.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p>By the way, the army in question has 450 professional soldiers, about 340 enlisted recruits, and about 100 civilian employees, and an annual budget about equal to 3% of Microsoft&#39;s R&amp;D budget.</p>

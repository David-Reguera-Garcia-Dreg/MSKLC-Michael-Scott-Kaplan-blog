<P><EM>Nothing technical, you know how it goes....</EM>&nbsp;</P>
<P>There are certain restaurants where I have some dishes that are my favorites, and I pretty much order them any time I am there.</P>
<P>Some people upon noticing this&nbsp;may claim that I am in a rut.</P>
<P>But for me, it is just recognition of what I like best....</P>
<P>I have already talked about (for example) The General's Noodles at <A class="" href="http://www.typhoonrestaurants.com/locredmond.htm" mce_href="http://www.typhoonrestaurants.com/locredmond.htm">Typhoon!</A> at least three times <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/04/29/413553.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/04/29/413553.html"><STRONG>in</STRONG></A> <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/05/15/417663.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/05/15/417663.html"><STRONG>the</STRONG></A> <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/05/28/422958.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/05/28/422958.html"><STRONG>past</STRONG></A>.</P>
<P>And how I am willing to scoot all the way over to Bella Botega to get some.</P>
<P>That dish is not what this post is about.</P>
<P>Now I have <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/09/04/4731970.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/09/04/4731970.html"><STRONG>also mentioned</STRONG></A> the Panang Curry at Thai Kitchen in Bellevue, of course five stars....</P>
<P>And to be honest I have been willing to scoot there before, too. And not just because&nbsp;I think it might&nbsp;be&nbsp;closer than Bella Botega.</P>
<P>Because I love the dish.</P>
<P>I especially love how the container they put it in cannot leak (an admitted edge over the General's Noodles).</P>
<P>And is the perfect size to eat directly from the container, slowly putting the rice in as I eat it.</P>
<P>Minimal dishes to do, which is perfect for a man who has actually on occasion bought dishes to avoid doing them!</P>
<P>Anyway, several days ago I had scooted there and picked up two orders to go, to eat for dinner on two successive nights.</P>
<P>I ate one that very night. :-)</P>
<P>Then the next night I ended up having dinner with someone, so the other one sat in my fridge another day.</P>
<P>The next night after that,&nbsp;I pulled the container out of the fridge, preparing to eat dinner.</P>
<P>I put the can of limonata&nbsp;right next to the container.</P>
<P>I turned to the dish....</P>
<P>When suddenly, I stopped.</P>
<P>There was a hint of something&nbsp;strange&nbsp;through the container. </P>
<P>Something green maybe.</P>
<P>I looked closer -- a definite spot of green.</P>
<P>Damn.</P>
<P>It was only in there two days. And it was in the fridge!</P>
<P>And wouldn't the five star curry kill off any potential nasty things trying grow in the food, at least for a little while?</P>
<P>Anything that can beat <A class="" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/brettsh" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/brettsh">Brett</A> should be able to beat some green&nbsp;whosiwhatsis no problem!</P>
<P>I wanted to raise my fists to the heavens and curse this ill turn of events.</P>
<P>I looked at it and where it was, and wondered if I could just avoid that part of the dish and eat around it.</P>
<P>But maybe if it really had gone bad, that would be a bad idea.</P>
<P>A&nbsp;very bad idea.</P>
<P>But the dish was so good, I had to figure something out.</P>
<P>Was the restaurant still open? </P>
<P>Could I get some more?</P>
<P>Should I just admit to my hunger and risk eating around the greenish spot in the curry?</P>
<P>I wouldn't have to tell anyone or anything, after all. It's not like I would write about eating around the mold in my blog or something, right?</P>
<P>I decided I had to open the container and look.</P>
<P>Maybe I could make&nbsp;an intelligent decision based on the smell of the dish.</P>
<P>Rationalization? Maybe. </P>
<P>But I was hungry and a wonderful dish sat before me. </P>
<P>I'll kick the the ass of this green whosihatsis before I'll let it scare me off.</P>
<P>Determined now, I slowly opened the container....</P>
<P>Very slowly.</P>
<P>The slowness was not due to the anticipation, though. </P>
<P>The container may well be leak-proof, but they are truly a fucking pain to open.</P>
<P>Nothing is perfect, right? :-)</P>
<P>It was open now.&nbsp;Somehow my eyes were closed.</P>
<P>I was&nbsp;afraid to open them...</P>
<P>It smelled wonderful!</P>
<P>Cautiously my eyes opened, to look at this greenish invader that had added so much stress&nbsp;to my dinner.</P>
<P><STRONG><EM>Crap!</EM></STRONG></P>
<P>I took a moment to reflect on this terrible&nbsp;ordeal I put myself through.</P>
<P>Then I ate my five star Panang Curry.</P>
<P>The entire dish.</P>
<P>Including the green pepper&nbsp;sticking out&nbsp;near the top....</P>

<p>If you stop posting in the next few days, I will call 911 :-)</p>
<p>But you'll be ok :-) Mold is used to make penicillin, so cannot be that bad :-)</p></div>

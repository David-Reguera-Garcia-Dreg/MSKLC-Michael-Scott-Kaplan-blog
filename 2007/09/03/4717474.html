<hr/> <!-- Archival Source: ProcessPostNew -->
<P>Way back in the end of 2005, in the post <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/11/14/492249.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/11/14/492249.html">ISO 8601 is asinine</A></STRONG>, I talked briefly about Aimee Mann and I quoted an interview from her talking about her song <STRONG>Long Shot</STRONG>, which started with the line "You fucked it up."</P>
<P>I also mentioned Julian Coryell, whose album <STRONG>Rock Star</STRONG> also has a single like that -- the title of the song is <STRONG>Asshole</STRONG>.</P>
<P><EM>(by the way, Julian is going to be at Chateau Ste. Michelle on the 17th opening for Madeleine Peyroux; I'd go except the last time I took someone to see an opener for Madeleine they fell asleep, and this has made me skittish about inviting others to witness some of my musical fetishes!)</EM></P>
<P>I was thinking about that the other day when someone suggested that this blog had managed to clearly position itself as a personal blog....</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><EM><FONT face="times new roman,times">Somehow Michael Kaplan managed to pull this off. I envy him for it.</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>It made me wonder how I managed it. </P>
<P>There are several theories, and I will present them here in the form of&nbsp;a Letterman-esque "top ten" list:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>#10: Irregular posting hours even when content appears regularly.</P>
<P>#9:&nbsp;Content that often differs from official MS strategy and that points out what I believe are some of the&nbsp;flaws in said strategy</P>
<P>#8: Masthead that claims that the blog is my "...random stuff of dubious value".</P>
<P>#7: Titles that are anything but professional.</P>
<P>#6: [Nod to Aimee and Julian] Curse words&nbsp;in the posts.</P>
<P>#5: [Nod to Aimee and Julian] Curse words&nbsp;<EM>in the titles</EM>.</P>
<P>#4: Complete and utter lack of formal style of any kind/totally random subject matter.</P>
<P>#3: Regularly apologizes for bugs and explicitly takes responsibility in a way that would send anyone in LCA into convulsions if it was an official blog.</P>
<P>#2 Openly insulting anyone who would quote the blog as an official source (aka "the Wingnut effect")</P>
<P>&nbsp;And the #1 reason that people assume this blog is not a formal source of information:</P>
<P>#1 It's the typos, man. How many official sources have so many regular and consistent typos/speechos?</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>

<P>While I have your attention, I thought I'd do a bit if track maintenance and take care of some questions people have been asking about the blog:</P>
<P>From Jon Reskind in the Suggestion Box: <STRONG>Do you have a podcast? And if not then why not?</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Hi Jon. I do not. I have no problem listening to podcasts, but I just don't think it's my kind of format. It would be more involved and formal and plus I think&nbsp;I lack the raw charisma to pull it off....</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>From a regular reader in a comment I can't remember where: <STRONG>Why do your blog posts use numbers rather than names?</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>I like the smaller titles, remembering that "feature" I pointed out in <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/11/09/490792.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/11/09/490792.html">Shrinking URLs down</A></STRONG>, which would not work with those long, huge&nbsp;URLs based on the title of the post rather than just a number....</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>From a reader named Sheila via the Contact link: <STRONG>Are you in a relationship? Sometimes you talk like someone who is and sometimes you don't.</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This one actually baffled me when I first read it. I mean I do joke about ex-girlfriends and occasionally the ex-fianc√©, but I don't know that I have ever overtly acted like someone in a relationship....</P>
<P>Plus I could not tell about the time-line -- was the question assuming I have been in one relationship continuously since the end of 2004? In the dory I could have been in an out of several of them during that time!</P>
<P>For the record (if anyone is keeping track), I am not in any kind of real,&nbsp;actual&nbsp;relationship right now. There are several reasons for this that are probably worth a blog post some day (by my criteria for posts that amounts to "stuff that interests me"), but I'll hold off and not do that today.Stay tuned....</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Hal asks: <BR><BR><STRONG><FONT size=2>Out of all the Kaplans in the world, I know only two Michaels. And that begs the question of whether you are one of them. Probably not but you never know. So here goes ...<BR>#1 is about 60 years old and was born and lived in Brooklyn for many years.<BR>#2 is about 55 years old and studied at SUNY Albany and was an Air Force officer.<BR>Would you like to be #3? I am really curious if you are truly a Kaplan (i.e. of Polish descent and a Kohainim) and if you have a clue as to what I am referring to. I mean no offense, Michael.<BR><BR>Hope you respond.<BR>Hal</FONT>&nbsp;</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Hi Hal, I am neither Kohain nor Levi, so I guess I am not #3. Sorry! </P>
<P>Kaplan is kind of an Ellis Island name for my family -- the original name is an interesting blog post on its own that I'll do some day...</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Sandy asks: <FONT size=2><STRONG>HI, I used to have a friend, Sheila Kaplan, and lost contact with her. Sheila has a son named Michael who used to work at UNI and I'm wondering if that's you. Please answer. Thanks. Sandy :)</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Hi Sandy, I am not that Michael, sorry. Though if Sheila Kaplan is reading this she can feel free to use the Contact link and I'll get her in touch with Sandy. :-)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>I also do not have a birth name of Mitchell,&nbsp;a sister named Tracy, a sister named Charlotte, or a father named Francis (to summarize four other "are you ____?" posts).</P>
<HR>

<P>Okay, that's all I had on tap, there is more somewhere but I'll do it another day....</P>

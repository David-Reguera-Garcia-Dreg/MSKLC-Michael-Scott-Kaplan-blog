<h1>DropDownWidth not dropped down with a localizable attribute?</h1>

<P>The purpose of marking properties in WinForms as localizable is to make sure that properties that localizers would posisbly need to change can be exposed to them.</P>
<P>All well and good, but it is easy to miss properties that are in retrospect obvious ommissions.</P>
<P>Like just the other day when Kollen mentioned:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><EM><FONT face="times new roman,times">We are in the process of localizing for Spanish and noticed that the DropDownWidth property on the ComboBox is not showing up in WinRes so we are unable to resize drop-downs to accommodate longer Spanish items.</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT face="times new roman,times">While the work around is to subclass, override the property and add the attribute, that can be difficult especially since this probably wouldn't get noticed by teams until they start the localization process after code freeze.</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Kollen is completely right, and it is an obvious ommission that will hopefully be addressed in some future version of WinForms....</P>
<P>I'll talk more about the general issue another day (I have to get to Shul now, sorry!).</P>

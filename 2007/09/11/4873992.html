<P>Almost (though not quite) hearkening back to <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/04/26/2290760.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/04/26/2290760.html">'The 44' (*not* 'The 4400')</A></STRONG>, <A class="" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_4400" mce_href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_4400">The 4400</A> is still an interesting television show, one&nbsp;that <EM>this</EM> post has nothing to do with, either.</P>
<P>The other day I was&nbsp;researching something about Micronesia and Micronesian languages, and I happen to run across the Ethnologue article about <A class="" href="http://www.ethnologue.org/show_language.asp?code=tpv" mce_href="http://www.ethnologue.org/show_language.asp?code=tpv">Tanapag</A>, a language spoken on the Isle of Saipan (ISO 639 code of tpv). </P>
<P>It just so happens that as of 2004 it has about 4400 speakers.</P>
<P>Given that (according to the article) the younger folk tend to speak <A class="" href="http://www.ethnologue.org/show_language.asp?code=cha" mce_href="http://www.ethnologue.org/show_language.asp?code=cha">Chamorro</A> (ISO 639 code of cha) rather than Tanapag, and also given that (again according to the article)&nbsp;speakers of Tanapag tend to have low proficiency in both English and Chamorro, it seems that Saipan has perhaps the highest form of generation gap.</P>
<P>This is ever so much more impressive than the banal form we have here in the US, ignoring the odd cellular commercial that exhibits the younger crowd speaking and texting a language that the adults cannot understand..... um..... ok, never mind. I guess we do it too. </P>
<P>We just haven't been able to get the folks at SIL to provide either an ISO-639 code for this new texting language, or receive&nbsp; translation of the bible into it. </P>
<P>TISNF!</P>
<P>I have always enjoyed the name Micronesia, and for years I was sure it had to be some artificial place, like maybe the home country of Microsoft where they invented the Microwave and the Microscope? :-)</P>
<P>By the way, if anyone wanted to create a custom culture or two if they had the data and wanted to help these people&nbsp;out, the names would be&nbsp;<STRONG>tpv-MP</STRONG> and <STRONG>cha-MP</STRONG> for the kids.</P>
<P>The petition for the version of the&nbsp;bible with verses suitable for texting can be started another day....</P>

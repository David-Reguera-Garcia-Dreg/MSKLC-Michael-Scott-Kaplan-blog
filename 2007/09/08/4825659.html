<P>Stu and I have a semi-regular debate going these days about an issue that I have covered a bunch of times in the past, for example in all of these posts:</P>
<UL>
<LI>28 Dec 2004 <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2004/12/28/333168.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2004/12/28/333168.html">"To start press the ALTGR key." Hmm... where's the ALTGR key? </A></STRONG></LI>

<LI>15 Mar 2006 <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/03/15/552031.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/03/15/552031.html">Multilingual keyboards and Microsoft Word</A></STRONG>&nbsp;</LI>
<LI>17 Apr 2006 <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/04/17/577196.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/04/17/577196.html">Get off my freaking key!</A></STRONG></LI></UL>
<P>and so on, you get the point.</P>
<P>Stu and I have gone around and around on this one, believe me.</P>
<P>I point out that is the biggest complaint we get from people having trouble with MSKLC-generated keyboards (at first they claim the AltGr and Shift+AltGr states don't work, then when we ask them try in Notepad they realize that the problem is they do not work in Word).</P>
<P>And he points out that no one seems to be complaining to the Word team on the issue.</P>
<P>So I point out that a lot of these people are creating keyboards so they assume that it is in the tool, first -- and then after I show them otherwise they figure it is a known issue.</P>
<P>And he points out that Word goes to tremendous effort to detect the CTRL+ALT vs. AltGr keystrokes so it can handle these two cases separately.</P>
<P>So I point out that not every key is convenient to shift with the right ALT key that is AltGr, so that some people need CTRL+ALT on the left side to do the same thing.</P>
<P>And he points out that most people don't even know about the CTRL+ALT method of getting at AltGr.</P>
<P>So I point out that not all keyboards have a right ALT key.</P>
<P>And he points out that he hasn't seen such a beast in a long time.</P>
<P>And so on....</P>
<P>Just recently I had a customer and regular reader named Fran who has been a big fan of my various MacBook Pro/Boot Camp posts remind me that my new favorite machine with the superior Vista experience:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/mac_experience.png"></P>
<P>has no Right Alt key on it. Doesn't that count?</P>
<P>Well, it certainly does count that it certainly has no Right ALT key:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/MacBookProKbd.png"></P>
<P>(though I&nbsp;think the Input Remapper makes the Right Apple key into an AltGr key, which does not help my 64-bit Vista much since the Input Remapper does not work there yet, and not everyone actually uses the Input Remapper (which is not there for Parallels, for example).</P>
<P>I'll be honest, I have been using the MacBook Pro quite a bit lately. It is pretty much the only one I take to meetings where I need a computer and it might be the only one I take with me on vacation later this month.</P>
<P>Sometimes it is booted into Windows, sometimes into OS X.</P>
<P>All this time though, and it was even the machine I originally installed Boot Camp on to investigate the bug I talked about <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/07/27/4075592.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/07/27/4075592.html">here</A></STRONG>, and I hadn't been looking at the Word issue (I hadn't even installed most of Office on Vista yet (I do have Mac Office on the Mac partition, does that count?).</P>
<P>Of course I don't always check out every issue on every machine, but in retrospect it seems like it was a pretty obvious thing to try out. :-)</P>
<P>Of course you can search on the web with simple keywords like <STRONG>Mac AltGr</STRONG> and see thousands of people pointing out the lack of the key and various workarounds,&nbsp;especially&nbsp;for people who are running Parallels or Boot Camp, and some of those pages point out that CTRL+ALT works just fine here.</P>
<P>Though there is that major caveat about using Word, of course....</P>
<P>I am going to install Word 2007 on the machine now, under both Vista 64 bit and Vista 32 bit. So I can test out the detection work in Word.&nbsp;I'll be sure to let everyone know what I find out.</P>
<P>And I know what I'll say to Stu next time I talk to him.... :-)</P>

<p>Hmm.. I always thought that AltGr = Ctrl+Alt (unless the application makes appropriate effort to distinguish).</p>
<p>What is Word supposed to use AltGr but not Ctrl+Alt for?</p>

<p>What the hell possessed Apple to put the little orphaned &quot;enter&quot; key down there?</p>
<p>And what is the difference supposed to be between &quot;enter&quot; and &quot;return&quot; that you need two labels on the key?</p>
<p>And is &quot;delete&quot; mislabeled when it's actually &quot;backspace&quot;? At least it's in the position usually reserved for &quot;backspace&quot;</p>
<p>It seems to be Yet Another Crap Chiclet Laptop Keyboard with very little range of motion and no feedback, but this isn't unique to Apple.</p></div>

<p>Hm. Good point. I Googled around and ran into <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-i18n/1998/04/msg00015.html">http://lists.debian.org/debian-i18n/1998/04/msg00015.html</a> which is rather long but also rather enlightening. Turns out I could be wrong here, because I've lived all my life in an xterm.</p>
<p>Now I've discovered why rxvt is different.</p></div>

Is there a way to turn Vista64 so that it recognizes AltGr independently of [Ctrl + Alt]? I wan't to enjoy keyboard shortcuts with [Ctrl + Alt] and lose the ability to trigger them through AltGr. I wan't my AltGr to be used _solely_ for my foreign (native;-) characters.</p>
<p>Some keyboard layout, keyboard config program, registry hack, keyboard driver, physical keyboard product?</p></div>

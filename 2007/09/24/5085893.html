<P>Now that I have been talking about collation in Windows across ten separate blog posts, I thought it might make sense to talk about the characters in Unicode that take up more space in the standard than any others -- <STRONG>ideographs</STRONG>.</P>
<P>Whether you call them Han or Hanja or Kanji, they are all basically Chinese characters used in either Chinese, Korean, or Japanese.</P>
<P>The story for collating these items was not created in a vacuum, but there also were not simple uncomplicated sources that were used in their creation.</P>
<P>The collation story is in fact kind of a messy one, due to many different factors:</P>
<UL>
<LI>The tables were mostly not updated for multiple versions of Windows despite the fact that more and more characters were coming into general use;</LI>
<LI>Most of the characters that were not added to the tables had <EM>some</EM> weight, just not the one to put them in the correct order;</LI>
<LI>Some of the characters actually had no weight, with the <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/01/18/355210.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/01/18/355210.html"><STRONG>predictable results</STRONG></A> thereof;</LI>
<LI>In the case of pronunciation based sorts, the "most common" pronunciation of some characters actually changed over the course of the last 10+ years.</LI></UL>
<P>But the goal is quite simple:</P>
<OL>
<LI>In the default table, put all of the ideographs after almost everything else in Unicode -- first regular CJK, then Extension A, then Extension B, in code point order for each section.</LI>
<LI>For each specific East Asian language, put the relevant ideographs in the expected order for the expected sort in question.</LI></OL>
<P>There are many different collations across the various locales, and I have talked about various issues in many different posts, from <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2004/12/27/332618.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2004/12/27/332618.html"><STRONG>Why is there no pronunciation-based sort for Japanese?</STRONG></A> to <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/12/07/500827.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/12/07/500827.html"><STRONG>Supporting a pronunciation based sort for East Asian languages...</STRONG></A> to Is it <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/06/11/428351.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/06/11/428351.html">Macau or is it Macao?</A></STRONG> to <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/01/03/508579.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/01/03/508579.html"><STRONG>'Acceptable' Japanese sort order?</STRONG></A> and more. </P>
<P>The simple fact is that trying order over 70,000 items is going to be complicated, though hopefully as intuitive as it can be....</P>
<P>Now prior to Vista there were several specific problems in the tables:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Missing ideographs</LI>
<LI>Some overlap between the language specific table and the extras meant to be put in the end</LI>
<LI>A few mistakes</LI>
<LI>A&nbsp;few changes in official source data (like for most common pronunciation)</LI>
<LI>Missing support of the expected repertoire in several national standards.</LI></UL>
<P>Though even with addressing all of these problems, there was a problem (in some people's minds) starting with Vista -- an issue I hypothetically discussed in <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/11/01/916477.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/11/01/916477.html"><STRONG>If you add enough characters to a sort, intuitive distinction can suffer</STRONG></A> and then more directly in <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/02/15/1667070.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/02/15/1667070.html"><STRONG>On distinctions that are primarily with [and without] difference</STRONG></A>. That latter post even had a nice high-view narrative of several the various East Asian sorts, </P>
<P>In the next post I'll dig in a bit and provide some examples with different sort keys across different locales....</P>

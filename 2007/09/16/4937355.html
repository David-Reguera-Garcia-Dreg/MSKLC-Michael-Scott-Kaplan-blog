<P>But to use, you pretty much just need line of sight and nothing much else. You can scroll around someone else's Zune if they are nearby and switch the song they are listening to and such....</P>
<P>(Verified experimentally at Crossroads earlier this evening, and I apologized right afterward, holding up my own Zune!)</P>

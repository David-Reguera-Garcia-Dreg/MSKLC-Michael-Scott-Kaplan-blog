<P>The question I was asked via the Comment link by William was:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><EM><FONT face="times new roman,times">Very offtopic since this isn't an internationalization question, but I see you have answered questions about time zones before. So maybe you can answer mine.<BR><BR>Why does the time change happen at 2am?</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Well, I could start by making it more of an internationalization question, and point out that it does not change at 2:00&nbsp;AM for all time zones!</P>
<P>The biggest degree of difference is a time zone that has its daylight savings change happen at noon, and there are several that happen right at midnight or an hour or less from it.</P>
<P>Thankfully neither happens in the US, for very good reasons in both cases:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Having it happen during normal waking hours is a nightmare for the working world, with one work day an hour shorter and another an hour longer. And how are store hours handled? A real awful situation twice a year, even if you make it less of a pain by doing it on the weekend.</LI>
<LI>Having it happen an hour or less from midnight means that normal calculations for what day it is can easily either skip days/repeat them, or oscillate between days (since the day will change, then DST can make it change back for a bit.</LI></UL>
<P>Assuming that 2 AM is the cutoff everywhere can cause problems as serious as&nbsp;those&nbsp;caused by&nbsp;<A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/08/20/4489662.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/08/20/4489662.html"><STRONG>It doesn't always happen on the hour</STRONG></A> problems, due to&nbsp;an algorithm making bad assumption on the day or the time....</P>
<P>Although this does not follow the usual definition of a localizability bug, it is not too far off of one given that its primary cause is code assuming that the time zone rules could never be different.</P>
<P>That and the fact that such issues care in a more literal way about remembering that the world is round (the kind of phrase that is used more speculatively to talk about localizability/internationalization issues!), and it ends up feeling entirely relevant and on-topic as a localizability issue! :-)</P>

<p>In the EU, on the other hand, all zones transition simultaneously at 1 AM UTC, though the local time varies from one zone to another. &nbsp;The Olsen time zone database provides full details for the rest of the world.</p></div>

<h1>[In/Out]laws can be a great news source (aka Maybe Alaska Air should sacrifice more goats?)</h1>

<P><EM>(With a&nbsp;title&nbsp;like that, you're </EM>&nbsp;expecting a technical topic???)</P>
<P>So I was over at Faye's breaking fast and brother-in-law Zack shared a fun little news story with us care of Reuter's entitled <A class="" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/lifestyleMolt/idUSDEL1551420070904" mce_href="http://www.reuters.com/article/lifestyleMolt/idUSDEL1551420070904">Nepal airline sacrifices goats to appease sky god</A>.</P>
<P>Sister-out-law Jenny had also seen the story and they were both talking about it.</P>
<P>Now of the last 16 Alaska Air flights I have been on, only 4 have left on time -- and several of those delayed flights were caused by mechanical/equipment failures.</P>
<P>I have to wonder whether that means William Aire (chairman, president, and CEO of Alaska Airlines) should have a more liberal policy on goat sacrifces. It might improve their on-time departure stats....</P>
<P><EM>In case you were wondering, I am clearly <STRONG>not</STRONG> speaking for Microsoft here; as far as I know no goats were sacrificed to help with any recent legal issues in Redmond, which come to think may be one of the problems....</EM> :-)</P>
<P>(Hat tip to both Zach and Jenny, <EM>my unusual news and ginger gurus</EM>!)</P>

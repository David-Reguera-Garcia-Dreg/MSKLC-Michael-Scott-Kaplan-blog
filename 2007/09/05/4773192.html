<P>Regular readers may recall <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/12/08/1242102.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/12/08/1242102.html">I guess we're not exporting the Zune just yet</A></STRONG> from December of last year....</P>
<P>I remember at the time a colleague telling me that her husband thought the art on that one made it a really great post. At the time I thought about how I should just do better art or get someone artistic involved with the blog, but I never followed up on that....</P>
<P>Anyway, back to the Zune.</P>
<P>As far as I know, things have not yet changed there and I have no idea what their schedules are, but after someone forwarded <A class="" href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/09/02/zune-hacked-for-korean-and-chinese-language-support" mce_href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/09/02/zune-hacked-for-korean-and-chinese-language-support">Zune hacked for Korean and Chinese language support</A> from the <A class="" href="http://www.engadget.com/" mce_href="http://www.engadget.com/">Engadget</A> site, it became clear to me that some people did not want to wait. :-)</P>
<P>Here is the screenshot (note the link to their site if you click on it):</P>

<P>Now I am not advocating the hacking of any device whatsoever. But I do think it is kind of cool that someone figured out how&nbsp;to do this, so I will silently cheer them for the ingenuity that they have shown while publicly wagging my finger at them for this thing that they have done....</P>
<P>May it encourage future efforts in the supported product! :-)</P>
<P>In honor of my official public silence in this matter, note the sponsor....</P>

However, I have no idea how you'll switch languages or IMEs.</p>
<p>Languages</p>
<p>English, French, German, Japanese, Dutch, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Danish, Finnish, Norwegian, Swedish, Korean, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Russian, and Polish</p>
<p>International keyboard support for English, UK English, French, German, Japanese, Dutch, Italian, Spanish, Danish, Finnish, Norwegian, Swedish, Polish, and Portuguese</p>
<p>Dictionary support for English, UK English, French, and German</p>
<p>I am, however, quite saddened it doesn't come with a Japanese dictionary. Also, the YouTube app on the iPhone won't let me watch videos with CJK names. What's up with that?</p>

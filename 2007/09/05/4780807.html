<h1>The Sorting It All Out on LiveJournal is not associated with this blog</h1>

<P>Earlier today I had someone ask me whether (as he put it) "the other Sorting It All Out" blog was in fact associated with mine in some way.</P>
<P>He also gave me the link, it is&nbsp;a LiveJournal blog. </P>
<P>There is no connection, truly...</P>
<P>The other site&nbsp;has some fairly racy text. From the author's own profile&nbsp;it is about "...a submissive trying to seek balance between the vanilla persona i present to the public and my private life."</P>
<P>(<STRONG>warning</STRONG>: it does not seem to me to be&nbsp;100%&nbsp;safe for work (but I&nbsp;did not spend&nbsp;ton of time verifying this, so don't click if you're at work, or if you do then b sure to keep in mind I warned you)</P>
<P>It just started up this July so I was here first. But obviously there all kinds of people with all kinds of issues to sort out. </P>
<P>The link is <A class="" href="http://radanols-girl.livejournal.com/" mce_href="http://radanols-girl.livejournal.com/">here</A>.</P>
<P>I did notice that she uses an Apple and has for the last few years. Her master (her term) does too, and she was apparently a former Windows geek until about three years ago, when she traded her BSDs for BDSM (her joke, not mine), and I am going to stop reading right now before I find out any more and decide to start reading regularly!</P>
<P mce_keep="true">&nbsp;</P>

<P>I didn't write the code in the KB article.</P>
<P>If&nbsp;someone asked me,&nbsp;I find the notion of solving this problem with custom cultures to be along the lines of curing dandruff&nbsp;by keeping your head shaved bald!</P>
<P><EM>(In both cases the overhead of the solution is overkill and&nbsp;may well be&nbsp;even be worse than the problem!)</EM></P>
<P>I agree with&nbsp;IDisposable that this should have been solved in&nbsp;a way that caused no client to break and that requires no code change -- if not in the immediate release causing the break then in the soonest release thereafter.</P>
<P>I didn't write the code in the KB article though -- I think <A class="" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/shawnste/" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/shawnste/">Shawn</A> did (I know he is a proponent for using custom cultures to solve problems such as this).</P>
<P>The code seems okay to me, though I probably would have bullet-proofed it for the case where the update had not been loaded and thus only the old names were valid -- since a non-specific catch for obvious, known and explainable errors is never ideal. But that may have affected the readability so I have no strong feelings for code that shouldn't ever need to be run more than once per machine....</P>
<P>But even now I would rather the problem was addressed in the product at all times, automatically.</P>

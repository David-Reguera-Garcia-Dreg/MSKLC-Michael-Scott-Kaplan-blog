<P>A couple of days ago, in response to <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/05/09/2503785.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/05/09/2503785.html"><STRONG>Language support for non-native speakers</STRONG></A>, Bertilo Wennergren <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/05/09/2503785.html#2513611" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/05/09/2503785.html#2513611">commented</A>:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><EM><FONT face="times new roman,times">So what about people used to a Cyrillic keyboard wanting to type Chinese or Hindi or Arabic? Or people used to an Arabic keyboard wanting to type in Bulgarian? Or people used to a Burmese keyboard wanting to type in English? You get my drift? &nbsp;The number of various keyboard layouts will be enormous if you take this idea to its logical conclusion.</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This is indeed where the idea takes itself.</P>
<P>So let's get taken in by it for a bit. :-)</P>
<P>Sometimes you will be talking to someone in your native language and it will be clear to you that it is not <EM>their</EM> native language. Because they will speak it with an accent.</P>
<P>What is really happening is that they are bringing with them knowledge of their own language and its 20-40 phonemes and trying to speak your language with its own (not entirely the same) 20-40 phonemes, and mapping the two as best they can. How well they do it largely depends on how&nbsp;close they are, though with the ~300-500 different phonemes out there (depending on who you ask!), there is a lot of room for confusion and error (and accents so thick that you can't always tell what they are saying!).</P>
<P>Now the keyboard mapping issue, and to be honest the very related cross-language transliteration issue,&nbsp;&nbsp;can be honestly thought of as the orthographic equivalent of the phonetic (well, phonemic) mapping that is implied above.</P>
<P>A language like English is actually a very natural one to consider for the effort, for several reasons:</P>
<UL>
<LI>As a language having 40-45 different phonemes despite having only 26 letters,&nbsp;there is a nice chunk of the phoneme list already hit</LI>
<LI>Since English is often used for transliteration, there are established, accepted&nbsp;mappings for the phonemes used in many other languages</LI></UL>
<P>Though Bertilo is right that it is a bit provincial to assume that such a solution will work for everyone, it is the one that will probably be most likely to have some mappings available.</P>
<P>And there is definitely no good way to guess at appropriate conventions here, even with data like Unicode names (for example look at my first cut of a Tamil-&gt;English mapping I&nbsp;gave <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/09/17/759687.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/09/17/759687.html">here</A></STRONG> that people in comments pointed out could benefit from using mappings that are more widely accepted in user communities).</P>
<P>For the time being we will ignore the fact that different language communities for a single language can each have their own mapping choices, and those choices can conflict with each other.</P>
<P>Well what if one took the mappings that people create in tools like the Microsoft Transliteration Utility (discussed <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/08/19/707013.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/08/19/707013.html">previously</A></STRONG>), and used them as the basis for a transliterating keyboard or input method?</P>
<P>This is an idea that has a lot of potential, if you ask me. </P>
<P>It is not even all that new, if you remember <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/03/08/546197.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/03/08/546197.html">Ideas about loading existing keyboards in MSKLC</A></STRONG> from last year which gave the three most common complaints from people trying to work with other language keyboards:</P>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>The movement of some letters within a script;</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>The movement of punctuation always;</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>The lack of phonetic relationship between scripts.</FONT></LI>
<P>Note that the problem here in this post is all about that third bullet point. </P>
<P>There is a really good model for functionality that could be considered for a future version of MSKLC (as luck would have it, some of the new owners of the tool skim the&nbsp;posts here from time to time!).</P>

<p>Quite interesting the way your thoughts are going here. &nbsp;This is exactly where Tavultesoft Keyman started (in 1992!) - the Keyman keyboard language came out of SIL's CC utility, which was widely used for transliteration and character mapping. &nbsp;One of the objectives of Keyman was to provide a relatively straightforward translation from a CC table to a keyboard layout.</p>
<p>That is one reason why Keyman works so well for 'phonetic' keyboard layouts.</p>
<p>This issue rapidly gets complex - for instance, Thai has 6 letters that are regularly transliterated to the English 'k' or 'kh'. &nbsp;Even ignoring the distinctions between the 6 characters, as I understand it, MSKLC/Windows keyboard layouts would not be handle 'k' vs 'kh' as there is no ability to handle context or sequences (deadkeys wouldn't work here). &nbsp;Are there plans to extend the Windows keyboard layouts to handle this type of situation?</p></div>

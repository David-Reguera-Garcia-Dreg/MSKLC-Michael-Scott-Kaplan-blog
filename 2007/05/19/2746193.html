<h1>Ssang. Ssang. Come Back!</h1>

<P>I must admit it sometimes takes me a while to think of a good title for a blog post.</P>
<P>In fact, I have more than a few posts that are all ready to go other than missing a title, and I am waiting until I think of the title, in fact.</P>
<P>It is for this reason that Sam's question via the Suggestion Box was so amusing to me:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><EM>In your post about SSANG you talked about song lyrics. Why didn't you consider other allusions like to the movie Shane?</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>It actually hadn't occurred to me, at the time. :-)</P>
<P>Though had I thought of it, I might have used it -- wouldn't <STRONG>Ssang. Ssang. Come Back!</STRONG> have been a great title for <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/02/20/1722221.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/02/20/1722221.html">Ssang Your Life (or alternately: I'd Like To Teach the World To Ssang)</A> ?</P>
<P>There must be people other than Sam and I who would have gotten the reference. Especially after Shane came up in The Negotiator a few years back (and unlike&nbsp;Shane,&nbsp;The Negotiator&nbsp;is a movie that seems like it alternates between being on the pay channels and TNT every few weeks).</P>
<P>But that leads to the problem, one that I have been dealing with lately by putting in multiple titles (and having at least one person complaining to me that long titles screw up some blog readers!) -- the fact that I should just choose one title for the title and leave it at that.</P>
<P>All I can say is that I will work on it. Sometimes I just can't decide....</P>

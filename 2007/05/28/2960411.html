<P>The piece of mail I got (via the Contact link) from Ken was:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><EM><FONT face="times new roman,times">Hi Michael,<BR>I have run into what I believe is a bug in MultibyteToWideChar() and WideCharToMultibyte() when the code page parameter is set to CP_THREAD_ACP, 'default language for non-Unicode applications' had been set to Hebrew.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is seen when using the utility macros in atlconv.h like T2WC.<BR><BR>I've created a simple test app that shows unexpected results on some systems.&nbsp; The code page inferred from CP_THREAD_ACP is not the same as GetACP().&nbsp; I have reproduced this on two different systems set to use Hebrew, but not on two other systems set to use Traditional Chinese - one of which was set to the full Traditional Chinese localized UI.&nbsp; The source is part of a default .net 2003 generated console project.</FONT></EM></P>
<P><FONT face="consolas,lucida console,courier new,courier"><STRONG>#include "stdafx.h"<BR>#include &lt;ostream&gt;<BR>int _tmain(int argc, _TCHAR* argv[])<BR>{<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; std::cout &lt;&lt; "default code page is " &lt;&lt; GetACP() &lt;&lt; std::endl;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; std::cout &lt;&lt; "_AtlGetConversionACP code page is " &lt;&lt; ATL::_AtlGetConversionACP() &lt;&lt; std::endl;<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CPINFOEX cpinfo = {};<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GetCPInfoEx(ATL::_AtlGetConversionACP(), 0, &amp;cpinfo);<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;std::cout &lt;&lt; "Thread code page is " &lt;&lt; cpinfo.CodePage &lt;&lt; std::endl;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return 0;<BR>}</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><EM><FONT face="times new roman,times">My results are:<BR>default code page is 1255<BR>_AtlGetConversionACP code page is 3<BR>Thread code page is 1252<BR><BR>When my application calls T2WC, the results are incorrect and the codepoints are extended to 16 bits, but not converted to their Hebrew codepoints.&nbsp; We are getting around this by using _CONVERSION_DONT_USE_THREAD_LOCALE, but I had wondered if others have heard of this problem before.<BR><BR>Thanks for your time,<BR>Ken&nbsp;</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Regular readers may recall when I pointed out <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/08/22/454360.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/08/22/454360.html">Why I think the thread locale really stinks</A></STRONG>.</P>
<P><EM>(In fact, I was asked not too long ago to help clean up some of the bad usages of the thread locale in various parts of Windows in shell32.dll and shlwapi.dll, something I will probably be working on shortly!)</EM></P>
<P mce_keep="true">Anyway, after Ken pointed out that the use of _CONVERSION_DONT_USE_THREAD_LOCALE works around the problem, it seems pretty obvious that CP_THREAD_ACP is none other than the LOCALE_IDEFAULTANSICODEPAGE as returned by <A class="" href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms776270.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms776270.aspx">GetLocaleInfo</A> with the return of <A class="" href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms776331.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms776331.aspx">GetThreadLocale</A> as the LCID.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">Now the thread&nbsp;code page&nbsp;is&nbsp;a pretty shaky thing, and not only for the reason that make me feel like the thread locale <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/08/22/454360.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/08/22/454360.html"><STRONG>stinks</STRONG></A>. Imagine basing code page conversions on something that any code running in the thread can change any time. Yuck!</P>
<P mce_keep="true">In fact, it is downright nasty that ATL and MFC made a breaking change in version 7.0 in this area (as described <A class="" href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/w1sc4t4k(VS.80).aspx" mce_href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/w1sc4t4k(VS.80).aspx">here</A>):</P>

<P mce_keep="true">String Conversions<BR><BR><A class="" title=sectionToggle2 name=sectionToggle2></A>In versions of ATL up to and including ATL 3.0 in Visual C++ 6.0, string conversions using the macros in atlconv.h were always performed using the ANSI code page of the system (CP_ACP).

<P mce_keep="true">Yuck. I hate breaking changes that are bad. And this is definitely one of them. :-(</P>
<P>Sorry Ken, the strange differences here are kind of by [bad] design. And your workaround is actually the fix here -- it works around what I consider a breaking change that breaks a little bit of ATL here.</P>
<P>In the end,&nbsp;my best advice is to NEVER use either the thread locale or the thread code page. For anything. Ever....</P>

<p>Do you know why the ATL &amp; MFC team did this? </p>
<p>It would be interesting to know as breaking changes are normally not approved lightly and particularly the change does not seem to be appreciated and producing the desirable result.</p></div>

<p>We have a specific set of threads that handle communication with various external systems, which must use UTF8. &nbsp;The rest of our system uses the system/user code page and/or UCS2. &nbsp;It would be really, really handy if I could set our communications threads' code pages to UTF8 (65001), so that all those implicit conversions between MBCS and UCS2 done by _bstr_t would `just work' in the comms threads... saving me from converting a lot of legacy (non-MBCS-aware) messaging code to handle it explicitly.</p>
<p>In fact, that's how I reached this page (googling for a cheap way to do this). &nbsp;You tease.</p></div>

<P>We have a non-unicode application written in VC5. Recently we migrated it to VC8. This application includes MFC, ATL, C++, C tech.</P>
<P>Once I change language for non-unicode programs to 'chinese (prc)' on win xp and run the application, user is able to enter chinese characters in the text field. This is being stored and retrieved in the database. </P>
<P>This works fine in VC5. After migration to VC8 it started failing. User provided user input æè³é¼»åç§ is being converted to ÃÃÂ¶ÃºÂ±ÃÂºÃ­Â¿Ã. </P>
<P>Research shows that CString to BSTR string conversion causes this problem.</P>
<P>CString strTemp = _T("æè³é¼»åç§");</P>
<P>BSTR bstrTemp = strTemp.AllocSysString();</P>
<P>MSDN says - </P>
<P>In versions of ATL up to and including ATL 3.0 in Visual C++ 6.0, string conversions using the macros in atlconv.h were always performed using the ANSI code page of the system (CP_ACP). Starting with ATL 7.0 in Visual C++ .NET, string conversions are performed using the default ANSI code page of the current thread.</P>
<P>I tried using SetThreadLocale(LOCALE_SYSTEM_DEFAULT); which resolved my problem.</P>
<P>In our application there are several threads being forked by many dlls. </P>
<P>1) How many times I need to call this API? Where? </P>
<P>2) Does it have any side effect if switched back to 'ENGLISH' system locale?</P>
<P>Testing will be cumbersome. As my product contains 15 exe and 100 dlls (ATL/COM, C++).</P>

<P>I have a hard time considering them confusables since people would be unlikely really confuse them. I mean, would you click on ɯoɔ˙ʇɟosoɹɔᴉɯ˙ʍʍʍ&nbsp;thinking it was <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/">www.microsoft.com</A>? :-)</P>
<P>In any case, still a fun link from way back when, especially as people continue to think about the issue with confusables in URLs....</P>

<p>Nothing bad happens to the site, unless the reader one is using cannot support Unicode well (these are all valid Unicode characters). The display shos lots of null glyphs for some people, but that is hardly damage that is irrepairable....</p>

<p>But that area is one I've talked about in the past (the actual confusables), and been giving feedback to the people doing the work here at Microsoft and writing the security reports for Unicode.</p>

<P>So I was looking at a bug on the cool Vista machine (you know, <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/12/14/1284914.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/12/14/1284914.html">this one</A></STRONG>!) the other day....</P>
<P>Since I last talked about it (a few months ago, to be more precise), I installed a whole bunch of UI languages on it.</P>
<P>Like more than the list of those currently available.</P>
<P>Actually. since I built some of them myself, it is actually a list is possibly more than the list of what will ever be available. :-)</P>
<P>All so I could see a huge language list. The things I'll do when I am bored on the weekend....</P>
<P>Anyway, I was looking at a bug reported with a Traditional Chinese UI language. And here is what I saw:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/spaced-cyrillic2.png"></P>
<P>Interesting spacing on the Cyrillic script languages, huh? :-)</P>
<P>I could not repro this with Japanese, Korean, or Simplified Chinese. It only happens with Traditional.</P>
<P>A couple other weird things, too.</P>
<P>(The unfortunate things that happen with Arabic script when the UI language is LTR&nbsp;have been mentioned before)</P>
<P>Kind of weird....</P>

<p>In big5 encoding (at least in the big5 ETen-extension), Cyrillic scripts are full-width. To compatible with old system, Chinese fonts always comes with full width Cyrillic characters.</p></div>

<P>In the old good time (pre-1995 age), Traditional Chinese computer system comes with <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/09/11/463672.html">full-width</A> Cyrillic fonts.</P></div>

<p>I think this is compatible with Big5 ETEN extension, which have full-width Cyrillic fonts.</p></div>

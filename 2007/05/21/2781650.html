<P>The other day Alex asked me:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2>
<P><EM>Are there any plans for including support for U+267F (the international wheelchair symbol) in any of the fonts that ship with Windows? I'm interested in its inclusion, and I thought you might know something about it.<BR><BR>-Alex</EM></P></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>I went and talked to some folks down the hall in Microsoft&nbsp;Typography to find out, and the word I got was that there is some real interest in picking up many of the various symbols in Unicode like this one in a future&nbsp;version of Windows. So one may well see them some day! :-)</P>
<P>It does of course lead to some interesting questions when one determines how they are included, though.</P>
<P>After all, one of the bad things about Wingdings and Webdings is that you are forced to select the font explicitly. But wouldn't the same requirement be here too?</P>
<P>Well, unless that special <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/10/18/481654.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/10/18/481654.html"><STRONG>sixth condition for being considered a complex script</STRONG></A> I mentioned last year were to be extended to these symbols, I mean....</P>
<P>Now as I asked in the title, I do wonder whether it would be inappropriate to call the efforts on the part of the Typography team in this space to be merely symbolic.</P>

Sometimes, that character will look out of place because of that, but at least it's readable. Well, most of the time, if I copy that wheelchair into a texteditor using a small monospaced font, it's barely decipherable.</p></div>

<p><strong>G&#252;nther</strong> on 26 May 2007 6:46 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Microsoft has released some fonts which everybody is allowed to use. For example Verdana and others which are commonly used on websites, and which I use for this reason. I cannot predict wether that would be useful or possible with future font updates. :-)</p></div>

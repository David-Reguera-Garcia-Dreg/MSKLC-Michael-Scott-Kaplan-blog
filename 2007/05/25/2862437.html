<P><EM>Absolutely nothing technical here!</EM>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When I tell people I enjoy listening to <A class="" href="http://www.teddygeigermusic.com/" mce_href="http://www.teddygeigermusic.com/">Teddy Geiger</A>'s Underage Thinking, people tend to look at me a little funny.</P>
<P>And not just the people who have no idea who the hell Teddy Geiger is. Even the ones who know are a little confused.</P>
<P>After all, he is hardly an angry female singer/songwriter (well, two out of four ain't too bad but it still seems against type).</P>
<P>And I am also not a 17-year-old girl. I don't even know any 17 year olds at the moment.</P>
<P><EM>(I point this out since Teddy was in the cover of Seventeen last November!)</EM></P>
<P>But I carry on and point out his role of Wayne Jensen&nbsp;on <A class="" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Monkey" mce_href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Monkey">Love Monkey</A>, the show that should still be on the air.</P>
<P>And if you take lyrics like this:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><EM>I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have<BR>For you I will<BR>You always want what you can't have<BR>But I've got to try<BR>I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have<BR>For you I will<BR>For you I will</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P mce_keep="true">It is obvious that he is very young and idealistic about love. Was I ever that young?</P>
<P mce_keep="true">Shit, I just realized why I am listening to him.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">Because I once was that young. And I once did feel that way, though I was not nearly as articulate about what I was feeling at the time.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">He has something that I lost some time over the last twenty years. Before I even knew it was something worth happening....</P>
<P mce_keep="true">Summary? As far a I can tell, Teddy Geiger is a more attractive, more articulate, more talented, and more successful version of the person I was back then. :-)</P>
<P mce_keep="true"><EM>(And also fall short of a Tom Ferrell type too, but that's another story!)</EM></P>

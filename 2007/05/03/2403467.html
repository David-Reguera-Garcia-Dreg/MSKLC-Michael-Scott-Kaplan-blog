<P>Kind of a fun localization issue one of the OEMs noticed.</P>
<P>They were looking at the Slovenian LIP, with two identically named menu items on that menu Moishe&nbsp;Lettvin talked about that I mentioned <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/11/26/1154836.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/11/26/1154836.html">before</A></STRONG>. </P>
<P>Luckily the ToolTips are different for people who know Slovenian:</P>

<P>Now for those who don't know Slovenian, here is what it looks like in English:</P>

<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/HibernateEnglish.png"></P>
<P>Kind of fun that the word (Mirovanje) was picked for both&nbsp;menu items&nbsp;-- how do they know when the bears are just napping and when they are actually in their caves for the winter?</P>
<P>Just brought a smile to my face thinking about the myriad of reasons that this kind of thing can happen (including the possibility that a language may not commonly make such a distinction!).</P>

It was found by the Monitor Magazine's reviewer and was promised to be fixed in the final version.</p></div>

<p>Just spent half a week in Slovenia, enjoying the delights of Bratislava. Very nice place. Next time I'll get up into the mountains as well.</p></div>
<p><strong>Ben Cooke</strong> on 4 May 2007 2:53 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>This is such a nit-picky gripe, but it's always annoyed me how the message you get after you select that second option says &quot;Hibernating...&quot; while it's committing the contents of RAM to disk and before the computer has switched off.</p>
<p>&quot;Hibernating&quot; is roughly equivilent in use to &quot;sleeping&quot;, not the process of falling asleep. Thus, a more correct message there would be &quot;Preparing to Hibernate&quot;. That it says &quot;Hibernating&quot; gives the impression that the computer can be powered off at that point because hey, the computer's already gone into hibernation because it's hibernating!</p>
<p>I don't lose too much sleep over it, but I figured since you mentioned the Hibernate feature.... :)</p></div>
<p><strong>Gasper</strong> on 4 May 2007 3:53 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>I am from Slovenia ....</p>
<p>Direct translation for Sleep is Spanje. </p>
<p>Mirovanje in Slovene means to be still (motion) - but it could be used as translation for Hibernate in computer science.</p>
<p>Official dictionary for Slovene is available on web:</p>

<p><strong>Christoph P&#228;per</strong> on 4 May 2007 6:40 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>I don’t know what the German localisation of Windows uses, but the bear metapher won’t work either: ‘to sleep’ is ‘schlafen’ (noun: ‘Schlaf’), but ‘to hibernate’ is ‘Winterschlaf halten’ (noun: ‘Winterschlaf’), ‘winterschlafen’ sounds very wrong. (Yes, ‘Winter’ means ‘winter’.) There are at least two states between being awake and being asleep, though, which may be used: ‘ruhen’ (~ ‘to rest’, rather ‘ausruhen’) and ‘d&#246;sen’ (‘to doze’, ‘to snooze’, ‘to maunder’). Apple at least chose the former with ‘Ruhezustand’ (‘resting state’).</p></div>

<p><strong>Mike</strong> on 5 May 2007 8:29 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>oh bum, that's what long term travel does to you. Well I had half a week in both Ljubljana and Bratislava in the last month (with Vienna and Budapest in between). I got to the Tatras (Slovakia) but not the Julian Alps (Slovenia). </p>
<p>Does this blog cover the eternal Austria/Australia mix-up? The pair that Microsoft mixes up all the time? (Bookshelf listed Australia as a wartime ally of Germany, and regularly posts to its Australian subsidiary through the European mailing office. I remember a MS product manager who attended a Photokina event in Germany, and thought she'd &quot;drop in to the Sydney office while she was in the area.&quot; LOL</p></div>
<p><strong>Primoz</strong> on 5 May 2007 5:33 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>@Mike: No it doesn't. Michael (the writer of The Glory of Carniola) is an American living in Slovenia and writing about Slovenia. Great reading.</p></div>

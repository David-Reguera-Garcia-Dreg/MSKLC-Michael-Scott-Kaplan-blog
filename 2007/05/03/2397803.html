<P>People in the building may not believe me, but I am very careful to make sure I do<FONT color=#ff0000>n't</FONT> ever hit people with the scooter while I am going through the building.</P>
<P>Sure, I make jokes about how&nbsp;it is a "strict rule" to never hit developers&nbsp;versus an "important recommendation" not to hit program managers.</P>
<P>And I take KC's old question of "What's the impact to test?" and suggest the impact is a scooter shaped dent in the SDET standing in the wrong place.</P>
<P>But I truly am kidding and would rather gouge my eyes out than ever hit any of the PMs, devs, or testers I work with.</P>
<P>Apparently there is (unknown to me) a General Manager loophole in all that? :-(</P>
<P>You see, it was after the Town Hall meeting. </P>
<P>I was getting some gummy bears from the back of the room and Julie was standing by the table talking to someone.</P>
<P>Suddenly the scooter started moving forward in its own!</P>
<P>She jumped out of the way sputtering "what the hell, Michael?" and the trip ended shortly thereafter, crashing into a tray of plates and breaking some of them. I realized that my jacket had gotten caught in the lever to go forward.</P>
<P>Mohammed was asking me if I was okay and ll I could think was <STRONG>Forget about me, I just ran over the General Manager!</STRONG></P>
<P>Luckily everyone was okay. Except for a few dishes, which&nbsp;I honestly feel like maybe I should be paying for....&nbsp;</P>
<P>I saw Julie in the hall yesterday and apologized profusely (she told me not to worry, that she was fine). </P>
<P>I am still mortified by the whole experience, even today.</P>
<P>Anyway, there is now an official law to not anyone with the scooter, not even directors, general managers, or execs. I mean, there was a rule before, but by being selective in my joking it could be construed as intentional omission and I don't want execs to feel like it is unsafe to walk the halls!</P>

<p>One completely changed meaning and one with no meaning =P</p>
<p>An amusing story nonetheless, though slightly less amusing for you I guess.</p></div>

<P>Some of you fans of The Fifth Element may recall my post <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/09/16/755152.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/09/16/755152.html"><STRONG>You want to change the time zone? Eto Akta Gamat!</STRONG></A> from last September.</P>
<P>It occurred to me after Bruce asked over in the Suggeston Box a question:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><EM>The old "control.exe timedate.cpl,,/Z Pacific Time Zone" doesn't seem to work in Vista.&nbsp; Is there an equivalent command that will change the client's time zone and refresh their clock immediately?</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>It is easy to see why (since although one can give oneself the privilege at any time, one does not have it by default) not having SE_TIME_ZONE_NAME on the process trying to change the time zone could lead one to not being able to change it....</P>
<P>I guess now the only problem is that as far as I can tell WMI on Vista does not know anything about an SeTimeZonePrivilege in the <A class="" href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/aa392758.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/aa392758.aspx">Privilege Constants</A>? :-(</P>

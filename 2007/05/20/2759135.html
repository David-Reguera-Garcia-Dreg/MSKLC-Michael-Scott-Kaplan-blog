<P>Sometimes the questions and answers go by and I am just a spectator watching (either because I didn't know the answer so I was waiting myself to see what others came up with, or else because I wasn't looking at mail just then).</P>
<P>The question Patrick asked was:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><EM><FONT face="times new roman,times">Do you know a way to reverse (flip right-to-left) the items in an image list that you are loading with ImageList_LoadImage?&nbsp; I am trying to reverse the bitmaps in the list so they will display correctly on an RTL system.&nbsp; The ILC_PERITEMMIRROR flag seems like it would do what I want, but I can’t find a way to specify it to ImageList_LoadImage or to apply it to the ImageList later.&nbsp; Any help would be appreciated.</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Now in this case it was actually due to both reasons (I wasn't looking at mail at the time and also I was not 100% sure about the answer). Luckily <A class="" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing">Raymond Chen</A> knew the answer:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><EM>As you noticed, ImageList_LoadImage doesn't accept ILC flags. You'll have to do it manually. ImageList_Create + LoadImage + ImageList_Add (or AddMasked). That's all ImageList_LoadImage does anyway.</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Now it turns out that in this case I knew part of the answer (the <A class="" href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms671757.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms671757.aspx">ImageList_Create</A> call with the ILC_MIRROR flag), but since I didn't have the whole list handy, it is probably good that I waited. :-)</P>

<P>Carlos asks:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><EM><FONT face="times new roman,times">Hello Michael.<BR>I received a new notebook with Vista Business Edition in Spanish (my local language) but I need it also in English, I search for a LIP file for english and can't find it. Does English LIP installation exists? it is possible to configure it on my spanish vista?<BR><BR>Thanks a lot.<BR><BR>Kind Regards,<BR>Carlos.</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Well,&nbsp;Carlos can look for available LIPs on <A class="" href="http://www.microsoft.com/industry/government/locallanguage/find-a-language.aspx" mce_href="http://www.microsoft.com/industry/government/locallanguage/find-a-language.aspx">this</A> site, to be sure. But in this case there are&nbsp;three problems working against him:</P>
<OL>
<LI>I believe this site is mostly all about the XP LIPs, at least for the moment (I'll keep people posted as more LIPs become available);</LI>
<LI>As far as I know, there is not currently an English LIP available;</LI>
<LI>As I pointed out in <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/12/29/1378466.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/12/29/1378466.html">By design? Well, not beautifully so....</A></STRONG>, most MUI functionality is limited to Vista Ultimate only.</LI></OL>
<P>Now I believe that #3 does not apply to Language Interface Pack languages, but then #2 enters into the situation, since English is a full SKU rather than a LIP language.</P>
<P>I'll tried asking the <A class="" href="http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~ssanty/cgi-bin/eightball.cgi" mce_href="http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~ssanty/cgi-bin/eightball.cgi">Magic Eight Ball</A> the question, and its answer was <STRONG>MAYBE</STRONG>. Hmm, not too helpful.</P>
<P>But never fear,&nbsp;I will try and find out if there is a better answer here over the next day or two -- functionality such as this is only useful to people when they can install it. :-(</P>

<p>I too have the same problem of Carlos, but with a small difference. I bought vaio laptop with Vista business in French version. But I need it in English.</p>
<p>Now I found that vista business does't support MUI since MUI is possibly installed only in vista ulimate/enterprise. So I searched for english LIP in:</p>

<p>Now I scared that english LIP is not available.</p>
<p>How can I change the language of my vista business from French to English? Do you have any update as on now? </p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

An english version of vista home premium that needs to be translated to spanish, is this possible,? I found on some microsoft's technet documents that this can be done, but can't get to the download anywhere. Vista's help states that they should be on windows update, but they don't appear as available updates. Is there a way to do that?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p></div>

<p>I just bought a new PC with Vista Home Premium installed (in French). </p>
<p>My French is terrible so I'd really like to make it speak in English but can't work out how to.</p>
<p>Thanks for the blog, if I work it out, I'll pop back and let you all know, if not, I'll be back anyway to see if anyone else has sorted it.</p></div>

<p>I wish we were all still using Amigas (but obviously more up to date ones!)</p></div>

<P><EM>(Nothing technical here, I promise!)&nbsp;</EM></P>
<P>Sometimes, the truth of a situation is subtle. It takes a whole lot of evidence to figure it out.</P>
<P>And other times, it is so obvious that you wonder why you didn't notice it in the first place....</P>
<P>Start with&nbsp;the fact that where I used to exercise (running) I stopped several years ago, around the time that I started using a cane. Okay, I guess that was about ten years ago.</P>
<P>Add to that they I stopped walking for the most part much more recently.</P>
<P>There is the fact that I am getting older. I can't make fun of my sister for being all old and such since I am nearly two years older than her. That much close to forty than she is, too.</P>
<P>Factor in that my weight is the same as it was when I was 24. <STRONG>Despite</STRONG> the fact that I was in <EM>much</EM> better shape then. The muscle/fat balance has clearly been shifting, even though it is not yet shifting the scale. The pants are the same but some of them have a tiny bit of a muffin top thing going. Which if you don't know what I mean I am not going to&nbsp;explain.</P>
<P>Then there is the cases of Limonata I just ordered. Aside from the odd extravagant meal I have,&nbsp;it is really the only thing different about my diet. I probably eat closer to healthy now than any other time since I was 18.</P>
<P>And finally, there is&nbsp;that Slimquick commercial. You know, the one with the cartoon figure of the woman and the man&nbsp;are there&nbsp;and she is saying </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=4>My husband quit drinking soda and lost 12 pounds I quit and lost <STRONG>one</STRONG>. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4>My husband quit eating subs and lost 15 pounds, and I quit eating bread <STRONG>2 years ago</STRONG>! </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4>My husband took up jogging.... </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4>Now enough already, what do you want to weigh ZERO?!?</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>You know that one?</P>
<P>So, to sum up....</P>
<P>I could blame the age. </P>
<P>Or the lack of exercise. </P>
<P>Or the recent even less exercise since I have the scooter.</P>
<P>Or could stopping the Pro Club membership be an overt act that would affect anything even though I stopped going six months before that? Why not?</P>
<P>Or I could blame the Limonata.</P>
<P>Frankly, I've decided that although The Nile is a river in Egypt that it has a tributary flowing through Redmond, WA. And I will stay&nbsp;by the banks of that&nbsp;river until I gain 12 pounds, like the cartoon husband in the Slimquick commercial. Because he is smiling when she is all mad at him. And because I love the Limonata, and I'd rather just blame some combination of the age thing and the [lack of]&nbsp;exercise thing, since I could try and do something about the latter even if the former is outside of my control....</P>
<P>There is an off chance the exercise might help fix the problem even if it really <STRONG>is</STRONG> due to Limonata.</P>
<P>But it isn't.</P>
<P>I'm really sure that it isn't.</P>
<P>Stop looking at the stack of cases of Limonata, dammit!</P>
<P>It is <STRONG>not</STRONG> the Limonata.</P>

<p>So, here it is:</p>
<p>====================</p>
<p>The Japanese eat very little fat and suffer fewer heart attacks than the British or the Americans.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the French eat a lot of fat and also suffer fewer heart attacks than the British or the Americans.</p>
<p>The Japanese drink very little red wine and suffer fewer heart attacks than the British or the Americans.</p>
<p>The Italians drink excessive amounts of red wine and also suffer fewer heart attacks than the British or the Americans.</p>
<p>Conclusion: Eat and drink whatever you like. It's speaking English that kills you.</p>
<p>====================</p>
<p>You are right, is not the Limonata :-)</p></div>

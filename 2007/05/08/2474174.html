<P>It was like literally a year and a day when I posted <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/05/07/592184.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/05/07/592184.html">See you soon?</A></STRONG> and it was a year when <A class="" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/">Eric Lippert</A> (in a <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/05/07/592184.html#592851" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/05/07/592184.html#592851">comment</A>) asked:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><EM><FONT face="times new roman,times">and why is it that on Classic Rock radio stations they always say "playing classic hits, back to back!" ? &nbsp;Surely the BACK of the previous song abuts the FRONT of the next song. &nbsp;They'd only be back to back if one of them were being played backwards, right? </FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>At the time I&nbsp;remember thinking that perhaps the second song was Stairway to Heaven and they actually were going to play it backwards to see if they could hear <STRONG>my sweet satan</STRONG> or not.</P>
<P>So that it would be back to back? :-)</P>
<P>But I decided that one did not bother me. The one that I couldn't stand was the one used in baseball all the time -- home run streaks that are <STRONG>back-to-back</STRONG>. </P>
<P>Or <STRONG>back-to-back-to-back</STRONG>.</P>
<P>Or <STRONG>back-to-back-to-back-to-back</STRONG>.</P>
<P>And so on.</P>
<P>It starts a phrase that is already a little questionable and takes it around the dance floor a few times in what only can be the most weird-ass, twister-game-from-hell, kind of <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/08/03/687388.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/08/03/687388.html"><STRONG>back-formation</STRONG></A> that I have ever seen.</P>
<P>It gets used other places (I vaguely recall TNT using it for three-hour Law &amp; Order marathon commercials, up until they moved into claiming that everything on their network proved that TNT knows DRAMA -- a factoid that I felt like throwing out the window when they actually mentioned <STRONG>the drama of NASCAR</STRONG>!). </P>
<P>But baseball seems to use it the most. Though at least they never even take it the last mile into backformationville and talk about a home run steak going <STRONG>bat-to-bat-to-bat-to-bat</STRONG> or something.</P>
<P>What's up with that?</P>
<P>Maybe it is just me.</P>
<P>Usually when a baseball game is going on and the team everyone is rooting for is in a position to talk about their team having a nice series of home runs, the best way to guarantee a legally defensible ass kicking would be to complain about this particular misuse of language.</P>
<P>It must be hard to be a linguist, sometimes.... :-)</P>

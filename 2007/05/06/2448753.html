<h1>One product's feature is another product's bug -- just ask 'em!</h1>

<P>Different products have different ways of describing what is essentially the same behavior.</P>
<P>Part of the reason for this is that the audiences are often very different, and it is therefore&nbsp;a matter&nbsp;common sense that something might be described differently.</P>
<P>But more of the reason is usually due to the differing ways that users might run across the behavior -- and whether they would consider it a bug or a feature....</P>
<P>For example, there is the whole issue of WORD sort vs. STRING sort that I have discussed <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/05/05/414845.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/05/05/414845.html">in</A></STRONG> <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/05/04/589656.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/05/04/589656.html">the</A></STRONG> <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/11/16/1086283.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/11/16/1086283.html">past</A></STRONG>, and the fact that WORD sorting is the default since it makes the most sense linguistically in the way it treats (for example) hyphenated words.</P>
<P>This particular&nbsp;behavior and the fact that it is the default in Windows really is considered a feature.</P>
<P>But you can see&nbsp;how Microsoft Jet describes it in MS KB 236952 (<A class="" href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/236952/en-us" mce_href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/236952/en-us">PRB: Sort Order Has Changed with Microsoft Jet version 4.0</A>) -- it is treated as a by design behavior change, with a bizarre combination of examples and explanatory text that is guaranteed to make anyone reading it feel like this is a bug (plus some incorrect descriptions, as well!).</P>
<P>To top it off, it claims that SQL Server full-text queries and Index server have similar behavior when searching (which they do), and then points to another article presumably implying they are related (they are not), which I will talk about another time....</P>

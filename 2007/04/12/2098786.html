<h1>The seven is not being crossed out</h1>

<P>The question in the microsoft.public.word.international.features newsgroup was:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><EM><FONT face="times new roman,times">In Europe the handwritten number seven has a short horizontal line through it. <BR>My question: Is there any Word 2007 or Vista system font that allows one to <BR>type such a European-style seven? <BR><BR>In Brian Livingston's and Paul Thurrott's recently published book, Windows <BR>Vista Secrets, they used this European-style seven. I first wrote to both of <BR>them and have not received a reply. <BR><BR>Perhaps I should also post this to the Vista newsgroup too. My thanks in <BR>advance if you can help me.</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Looking at all of the fonts I have installed on this machine, here are the ones with that short horizontal line through the seven:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Bradley Hand ITC</LI>
<LI>Forte</LI>
<LI>Guttman Haim</LI>
<LI>Guttman Haim-Condensed</LI>
<LI>Magneto</LI>
<LI>Script</LI></UL>
<P>None of these fonts look like the ones used in&nbsp;a book, though....</P>
<P>There do not seem to be many (and I am tempted to say *any*) fonts that will combine the number 7 with U+0335 to allow a line through the seven to look right....<BR><BR>Perhaps some fonts include it as an OpenType feature.</P>
<P>The real&nbsp;answer might be to ask Brian and/or Paul? It may not get the font but at least one will know where the seven comes from!</P>

<h1>Maybe it was registry rumination</h1>

<P>One of the things that <A class="" href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/tools/msklc.mspx" mce_href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/tools/msklc.mspx">MSKLC</A> does in its installation packages is add the necessary registry key and related values to support the keyboard layout on the machine.</P>
<P>These are the ones under <STRONG>HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard Layouts</STRONG>.</P>
<P>Anyway, since one of the big features of the 1.4 update was 64-bit support, I had to look into what had to be done differently for 64-bit machines.</P>
<P>Among other things,&nbsp;I looked up all the information about <A class="" href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/aa384232.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/aa384232.aspx">registry redirection</A>, specifically about <A class="" href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/aa384235.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/aa384235.aspx">registry reflection</A> and <A class="" href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/aa384253.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/aa384253.aspx">shared registry keys</A>.</P>
<P>And after I read those topics and noticed that my subkey's&nbsp;tree was apparently not covered by either technology, I made a little note to look into whether I would need to write the key twice (once for 32-bit and once for 64-bit!).</P>
<P>Luckily I did not do more than make that note, since it was not needed. I only had to write the keys once in the install package, and the keyboard worked for both 64-bit and 32-bit (once I was putting the right layout DLLs into the right directories, at least!).</P>
<P>OK, so its not redirection or reflection or replication or any of these other technologies (or if it is, it is not documented as such!).</P>
<P>So I ruminated on this for a bit, and decided to tentatively name the effect "<STRONG>registry rumination</STRONG>" in honor of this intellectual pause I took between Limonatas.... :-)</P>

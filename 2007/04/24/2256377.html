<P>About a week ago I&nbsp;was talking about <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/04/17/2166496.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/04/17/2166496.html"><STRONG>The problem with using ordinal (a.k.a. lexicographic, a.k.a. binary) type comparisons</STRONG></A> and I mentioned that I talk about it a bit tomorrow.</P>
<P>Well, it was one of those newfangled tomorrows that happen about a week later.... :-)</P>
<P>One of the alternate ideas that has been really popular in&nbsp;one developer's&nbsp;mind (I won't say who!)&nbsp;is the notion of doing a regular linguistic comparison, and then if the two strings are equal doing a binary comparison in order to tell the two apart, like maybe comparing their code points. </P>
<P>Anyone&nbsp;care to venture a guess why that might be a bad idea?</P>
<P>And then as a bonus how that wrong answer can perhaps lead toward an answer that is better than the wrong one and also better than the current one?</P>
<P>I'll talk more about this tomorrow -- the old fashioned kind of tomorrow that is just 24 hours away!</P>

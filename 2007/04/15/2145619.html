<P>I may never be entirely used to working for Microsoft, as opposed to working with Microsoft products....</P>
<P>One of the things Scott Hanselman suggested yesterday in response to this whole series about font embedding in&nbsp;a managed application (prior posts <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/04/14/2128198.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/04/14/2128198.html"><STRONG>here</STRONG></A>, <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/04/14/2133650.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/04/14/2133650.html"><STRONG>here</STRONG></A>, <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/04/14/2134278.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/04/14/2134278.html">here</A></STRONG>, and <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/04/14/2137215.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/04/14/2137215.html">here</A></STRONG>) in bold red so that it would not be missed, in <A class="" href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/CustomCulturesWinFormsFontEmbeddingCodeWithEthiopianAmharicForVistaAndXP.aspx" mce_href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/CustomCulturesWinFormsFontEmbeddingCodeWithEthiopianAmharicForVistaAndXP.aspx">this</A> post of his:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000><STRONG>I hope that folks tell Michael and Microsoft that this is a significant business scenario and encourage them to advance Michael's Sample Code into a full-fledge and supported feature in WinForms</STRONG>.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This idea had never occurred to me!</P>
<P>No need to convince <STRONG>me</STRONG> about the scenario, though. I recognized the number of times that this would be useful and it is one of the reasons I&nbsp;put the sample together (it is hard to pass up those "real world" requirements when they come&nbsp;up.&nbsp;</P>
<P>I had been thinking about perhaps getting some samples integrated into the documentation eventually (after they were cleand up a bit, of course!), but the idea of adding support for embedded fonts into WinForms directly to get proper support within managed applications is a really good idea for people to be thinking about, I think.</P>
<P>Interestingly enough, I was sitting in a meeting on Friday where some people across the street working on .NET asked me for some product feedback ideas for next version telling me that this was a good time to bring up actionable ideas. They were BCL people, to be sure. But ideas are still ideas, right?</P>
<P>My timing is never this good!</P>
<P>Next step, talk to some people on the WinForms team.... :-)</P>

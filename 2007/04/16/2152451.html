<P>We've been talking about DPI a whole bunch, including not disabling and disabling the high DPI support in Vista. These two screen shots taken on a machine with 192 DPI will not show the final word (that comes in another post, soon!), but they will provide the penultimate word....</P>

I'm guessing the top one uses the Vista scaling mode since it's been scaled up from 96dpi, while the second shows that the application can actually handle the higher DPI.</p>
<p>You tell Vista 'no, I really *do* understand DPI' in the manifest, or by calling SetProcessDPIAware. This design has the problem of not working well for any existing applications that did work properly at non-default DPI.</p>
<p>When trialling a late release candidate of Vista on my 'new' laptop (1680x1050, about 15&quot; diagonal, approx 120dpi), I found both options to be equally horrible and set it back to 96dpi. Particularly I found IE 7.0 didn't work well - a lot of too-small icons and misplaced text. AVG seemed to be claiming to be DPI-aware but then getting their font size calculations wrong, so a lot of text was too small.</p>

Regardless of whether that &quot;XP Scaling Mode&quot; was on or off, so many non-Microsoft apps (including Windows Mail, which exposes old MFC UI bugs cleaned up in Outlook Express) produced that astigmatic look. I think all were returned again and again, build after build, as not repro.</p>
<p>Since running a Tablet at real DPI produces tangible benefits in that on-screen measurements = real world measurements, that's one thing that's made Vista less palatable than XP. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn't check the released build, but was comprehensible help text every produced for the &quot;XP Scaling Mode&quot; option?</p>
<p>And while I think about, there's another international twist to the ClearType issue. The ClearType Tuner was never integrated into Vista (IIRC it was only an XP Power Toy because of timing issues with ship dates) and so is left as an English-language-only utility.</p></div>

<p>Once I upgraded to Vista, though, many of my older applications were not marked with the &quot;high DPI aware&quot; compatibility flag -- even ones from Microsoft (Visual Studio 2005 was a big one for me). Even brand spanking new apps, like Hold'Em Poker!! Hold'Em Poker looks AMAZINGLY GOOD with high DPI settings.</p>
<p>Anyway, I've ranted about this enough (see <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://codeka.com/blogs/index.php/dean/2007/02/04/more_high_dpi_woes_in_vista_solution">http://codeka.com/blogs/index.php/dean/2007/02/04/more_high_dpi_woes_in_vista_solution</a> or <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://codeka.com/blogs/index.php/dean/2007/01/13/why_i_won_t_use_windows_vista_mail">http://codeka.com/blogs/index.php/dean/2007/01/13/why_i_won_t_use_windows_vista_mail</a> and so on) so sorry about that... we're getting rather off-topic here anyway ;-)</p>

Kaplan</strong> on 17 Apr 2007 5:12 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Although so many applications you have worked with do well in the original mechanisms for high DpI settings, the fact remains that there are many applications that do not do well here.</p>
<p>Now that I have learned more about the reasons for the high DpI feature added to Vista, I am disappointed in it because it does feel like &quot;giving up&quot; on the plan for having apps properly support the scenario. But at the same time, I think most customers have given up on Microsoft making it easy for developers to do....</p>

<p>It's certainly more work to get your app working in high DPI than it used to be. Even Microsoft gets it wrong (ref the the posts I pointed to above).</p>

<p>But I know that my particular feelings in this case are often outweighed in the minds of those who triage by the real numbers on how many customers end up with a better effect....</p>

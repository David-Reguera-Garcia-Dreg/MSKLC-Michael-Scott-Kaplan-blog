<P><EM>(Absolutely positively nothing technical, whatsoever)</EM></P>
<P>My grandmother said those words as I stood in the kitchen, about to head out to the car taking me to the airport.</P>
<P>Of course I still had to go.</P>
<P>I had been&nbsp;in Ohio&nbsp;a week, probably one of the longest vacations I had taken since I first started working for Microsoft full time.</P>
<P>Vacations have perhaps gotten less glamorous than they used to be. </P>
<P>I mean, back in the day it might have been Bangkok or Grand Cayman or Hong Kong or Hawaii or Singapore or Amsterdam or Taipei or Little Cayman or Tokyo.</P>
<P>Suddenly it was Beachwood.</P>
<P>And now I am heading back to Redmond on a 757.</P>
<P>It was just&nbsp;last week that I realized that I have lived in Redmond longer than any other place I have in my life. I guess the short term contract worked out okay in the end....</P>
<P>But I think back to my grandmother's words again -- <EM>I don't want you to go</EM>.</P>
<P>Now maybe it is just the music I am playing at the same time as I am writing this post, and with that in mind you can proably discount everything that follows to some extent.</P>
<P>But I have heard those words before. And to be blunt the people who said them were people who were important to me. </P>
<P>Well, ast least&nbsp;more important than the people who have said "I <STRONG>do</STRONG> want you to go" (or less formally "get the hell out"!).</P>
<P>A few of these people were girlfriends, or lovers.&nbsp;Some of them were very good friends, people I relied on (and vice versa). One of them was just four years old. And don't think for a minute that the last one on the list was the easiest of the bunch.</P>
<P>Yet each time, at the point where someone was&nbsp;saying the words, I was not going to stay.</P>
<P>Worse, each time, I think the person saying it knew nothing was going to change just because they said something.</P>
<P>So what is being expressed, exactly? </P>
<P>Sadness? Anger? Frustration?</P>
<P>A general sense of pathos about a universe that would conspire to move two people away from each other?</P>
<P>Perhaps all of those things. And more.</P>
<P>Or maybe I am underestimating everyone's intentions.</P>
<P>It could be just what Kathleen Edwards was thinking about in Old Time Sake, or maybe even what&nbsp;William Thacker&nbsp;was thinking when he answered Anna Scott's request to stay a bit longer with <EM>Stay Forever</EM>.</P>
<P>It&nbsp;may just&nbsp;be that in some cases they were actually hoping I would stay. For a day, for a week, for a month, forever.</P>
<P>Maybe by leaving&nbsp;(the situation, the place)&nbsp;I really was letting someone down, dashing a mad hope that someone who would smuggle a cat into Ankara on the way to a Jethro Tull show for no other reason than he promised he would return the cat to its owner&nbsp;might bend the universe for a moment and delay or dash the plans for no other reason than someone said the words.</P>
<P>Would it make a difference? Hard to say....</P>
<P>Now as I re-read this&nbsp;entry that I may just delete rather than posting it, I can recall one time that I did heed the words.</P>
<P>A time that she said <EM>I don't want you to go</EM> that I stopped what I was about to do and asked her if she meant it. And when she said she did I changed the plan of ending a relationship and turned back to her so that I could hold her and tell her that I was hers.</P>
<P>Not that it made much difference, though -- that relationship was over too, eventually. In fact, it might have been easier had I not turned around.</P>
<P>Maybe I just decided to stop heeding the words. Maybe now I just take them as a very sweet expression of sadness in a world that can't change on the basis of six words, even for a little bit. So I nod and say <EM>I wish I didn't have to</EM> and I still leave.</P>
<P>Perhaps I am just a cynic now.</P>
<P>But I'll tell you a secret, though. I don't believe it.</P>
<P>Because I said the words to someone once, and that someone is still in my life. </P>
<P>And they smile around me just often enough that I believe they are happy about it.</P>
<P>In other words, they didn't go. And in the process of all that staying, they showed a strength of character <STRONG>for which</STRONG> I am grateful, <STRONG>of which</STRONG> I am jealous, and <STRONG>to which</STRONG> I aspire.</P>
<P>I mean, I believed in life's rich tapestry even before Modern English was singing about it. And I believe in it now. </P>
<P>If you look&nbsp;Farther&nbsp;Down (apologies to Matthew Sweet!), I am an optimist, no matter how cynical I may seem at times.</P>
<P>So the next time it happens, maybe I'll be braver. Maybe I will change the itinerary or the plans or the direction in life. Whichever might be appropriate.</P>
<P><EM>(Unless the person saying it actually&nbsp;read this post, in which case I might have to disqualify the words; readership may have its privileges around here but I have to draw the line somewhere!)</EM></P>
<P>You may not have any idea what this post is about right now. But maybe some day you will.... :-)</P>

<P>surely sometimes you have to leave - move on - extend yourself as a human being. I think sacrifice is as much a part of life as love.</P>
<P>The person(s) you leave loose you, you loose them, but you get something, I'm not sure what, back in return.</P></div>

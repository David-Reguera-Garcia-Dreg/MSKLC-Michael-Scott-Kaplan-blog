<h1>Those Uniscribe samples from 'the hardest working ISV in complex scripts'</h1>

<P><EM>(Apologies to the&nbsp;very cool ISV who worked hard to provide samples whose name I riffed for the title!)</EM></P>
<P>Over in the Suggestion Box, Chris asked:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><EM><FONT face="times new roman,times">I'd like to know where to find the corresponding .h and .lib files for developing applications that use the Uniscribe OpenType APIs. The version of usp10.h in the latest platform SDK, as downloaded from MSDN today (3 July '07), doesn't have these.<BR><BR>Any practical examples on programming with them would also be welcome, since there is precious little documentation even about using Uniscribe, never mind using it with OpenType features for more advanced typography.</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Well, I just went though the motions and verified that the latest Vista SDK (officially entitled <A class="" href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=c2b1e300-f358-4523-b479-f53d234cdccf" mce_href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=c2b1e300-f358-4523-b479-f53d234cdccf">Microsoft® Windows® Software Development Kit for Windows Vista™ and .NET Framework 3.0 Runtime Components</A>), has the latest version of the lib and header file for Uniscribe, including all of the new OpenType functions and structures.</P>
<P>As for the samples, I bemoaned the&nbsp;lack almost a year and a half ago in <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/12/06/500485.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/12/06/500485.html">The lack of Uniscribe samples</A></STRONG>. Though I&nbsp;got to&nbsp;point out (a few months later) some good work to provide a few samples in <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/03/11/549657.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/03/11/549657.html"><STRONG>Was someone still looking for Uniscribe samples?</STRONG></A>&nbsp;that James Brown put together. There are not plenty of the OpenType samples there, though there actually is info in the documentation of the functions themselves and if one understands the older function one can probably understand the new one without too much trouble....</P>

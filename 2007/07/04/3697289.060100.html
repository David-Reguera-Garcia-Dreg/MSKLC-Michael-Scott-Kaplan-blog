<p><em>(Forgive the Nicol Williamson riff!)</em></p>
<p>There is a difference between the official ISO 8859-7 standard (which provides an 8-bit code page for Greek) and the version of 8859-7 that Microsoft provides (via code page 28597).</p>
<p>Well, they used to be the same, once upon a time.</p>
<p>But then in 2003, as Jukka Korpela describes in <a href="http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/unicode/greek.html">this</a> excellent resource page, the ISO standard was updated to add two entries for previously unassigned code points:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>0xA4  0x20AC  #       EURO SIGN<br>0xA5  0x20AF  #       DRACHMA SIGN</p></blockquote>
<p>People might notice that this is the very sort of thing that Microsoft used to do from time to time that pissed people off -- modifying code pages. In fact, the wide update to add U+20ac to almost all of the Windows "ANSI" code pages did meet with some complaints, which is funny since the very same change happened in the ISO code page too.</p>
<p>In a way, it is unfortunate that we learned our lesson here -- updating 128597 really isn't an option at this point.</p>
<p>Though everyone ought to be using Unicode anyway. :-)</p>

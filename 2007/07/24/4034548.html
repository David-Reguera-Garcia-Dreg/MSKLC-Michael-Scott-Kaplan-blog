<h1>Product [Un]fair?</h1>

<P><EM><FONT color=#ff0000>You almost certainly don't care. Truly!</FONT></EM>&nbsp;</P>
<P>So I spent a bit of time at the [Microsoft Internal] Product Fair today. I just scooted on over.</P>
<P>Scooting&nbsp;to the various tables, seeing who was there, getting SWAG, entering drawings, asking questions. You know, the usual....</P>
<P>I also really confused the woman handing out snow cones when I asked for one that was half blue raspberry and half cherry. :-)</P>
<P>But in the end, it was not a much fun as I would have liked.</P>
<P>I couldn't get anywhere near the popular tables without either being rude or&nbsp;having a&nbsp;handler with me to run interference for crowds and, well, be rude. </P>
<P>I was able to get at the less popular tables because (duh!) they were less popular. But usually there was less of interest to me, too.</P>
<P>It was not a statement of accessibility of the event itself, because I was able to get everywhere if you ignored the huge throngs. But I couldn't ignore the huge throngs since they were in the way a lot of the time.</P>
<P>It isn't like they could run a less crowded version and ask all of those people to run tables just so a few people like me&nbsp;could see stuff (this was a suggestion one person made after we watched someone cut me off and almost get hit by the scooter which was in line for a particular table since I didn't expect someone to do that).</P>
<P>So in the end it was more of a Product [Un]Fair for me, though mainly because I didn't want to be "that guy".</P>
<P>You know the one I mean. The one Richard Brooks was talking about in the second episode ever of Law &amp; Order (Subterranean Homeboy Blues) when he suggested to an arrogant Akili Prince that "<STRONG>No one likes a wiseass in a wheelchair.</STRONG>" Because I know I wouldn't like one either, even if I acted polite about it.</P>
<P>It is probably just me. I mean, no one was being rude, but no one noticed. Until they did and then they quickly moved out of the way and acted like they had been doing something wrong.</P>
<P>Which they weren't.</P>
<P>In the end, I hated making people feel bad, they probably weren't thrilled will feeling bad, there was no international&nbsp;table that I saw,&nbsp;and&nbsp;I didn't get to see lot of the stuff that looked really interesting.</P>
<P>So maybe&nbsp;I'll skip it next time. There are more important things in the world than <A class="" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swag" mce_href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swag">swag</A>. :-)</P>
<P>On the other hand, if they have a separate event for the interns next time, maybe I can convince somebody that I should be allowed to attend that slightly more accessible event? Another good idea from someone who noticed when I was having trouble....</P>

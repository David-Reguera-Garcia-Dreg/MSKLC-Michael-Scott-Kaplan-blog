<P>A tribute to plurals, with fondest memories of the first comedian I ever enjoyed, Allan Sherman (original inspiration of Weird Al Yankovic for those who don't know the name):</P>

<P>Pluralization is hard.</P>
<P>Even in English you need a huge dictionary with all of the weird and interesting exception cases (once you convince yourself that sticking an "s" on the end of every word won't do it.</P>
<P>It came up again&nbsp;in multiple comments to <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/07/22/3998892.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/07/22/3998892.html">In a much better position to handle inserts</A></STRONG> by Centaur like <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/07/22/3998892.html#4000233" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/07/22/3998892.html#4000233">this one</A> and <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/07/22/3998892.html#4011219" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/07/22/3998892.html#4011219">this other one</A>.</P>
<P>And his examples were not really overstatements, believe it or not.</P>
<P>We'll start with the obligatory <A class="" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluralization" mce_href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluralization">Wikipedia link on pluralization</A>, which will help to scratch the&nbsp; surface enough to make one realize what one has just gotten oneself into.</P>
<P>Languages like Spanish are considered pretty simple but can still fill a page with the <A class="" href="http://spanish.about.com/cs/writing/a/writing_plurals.htm" mce_href="http://spanish.about.com/cs/writing/a/writing_plurals.htm">explanation</A>&nbsp;of them.</P>
<P>English is reasonably simple with its cases for one, many, and&nbsp;uncountable (where the uncountables are usually in singular form, and zero items take the plural form). But all of the rules with subject/verb agreement are the min force behind me not paying attention in English class as a youth and being much more interested in the weird rules of other languages than the rules of my own. You could almost blame my linguistic notions on the crazy orgy of inconsistencies&nbsp;embodied in&nbsp;my native tongue.</P>
<P>And then in French things are pretty simple (ref: <A class="" href="http://www.ielanguages.com/french1.html#plural" mce_href="http://www.ielanguages.com/french1.html#plural">here</A>, <A class="" href="http://www.ielanguages.com/french2.html#precede" mce_href="http://www.ielanguages.com/french2.html#precede">here</A>, and <A class="" href="http://www.ielanguages.com/french2.html#plurals" mce_href="http://www.ielanguages.com/french2.html#plurals">here</A>). Then again those page list exceptions up the wazzoo. Oh, and zero items take a singular form, which also sounds weird to me though someone from France would find the converse to be true.</P>
<P>Then there is <A class="" href="http://www.hebrew4christians.com/Grammar/Unit_Four/Pluralization_Rules/pluralization_rules.html" mce_href="http://www.hebrew4christians.com/Grammar/Unit_Four/Pluralization_Rules/pluralization_rules.html">Hebrew</A>, whose uncountable words tend to take plural form. Oh, and they add gender to the mix as many others do, each with a different suffix. Then there are those bisexual words like "one" which have both a masculine and feminine suffix form. And some words that are feminine yet take a masculine plural suffix.</P>
<P>Most <A class="" href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;newwindow=1&amp;q=+site:en.wikipedia.org+pluralization+indic" mce_href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;newwindow=1&amp;q=+site:en.wikipedia.org+pluralization+indic">Indic languages</A> have singular, dual, and plural forms, though <A class="" href="http://lrs.ed.uiuc.edu/Students/avatans/grammar.html" mce_href="http://lrs.ed.uiuc.edu/Students/avatans/grammar.html">Hindi</A> only has singular and plural while Sanskrit has the dual form too.</P>
<P>Lots of other Indo-European languages also have a dual form.</P>
<P>Polish has singular and plural like most of them, but then it also has a paucal form for when the last digit is 2, 3, or 4 (not including 12, 13, or 14).</P>
<P>Persian (<STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/05/16/599204.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/05/16/599204.html">or is it Farsi?</A></STRONG> <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/05/23/604843.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/05/23/604843.html"><STRONG>Or maybe not!</STRONG></A>)&nbsp;has&nbsp;many&nbsp;rules a lot like English, other than the influx of Arabic loan words that come with their plurals and make up a lot of exceptions -- which, come to think of it, is also a lot like English. Though with different loan words (and of course the different script).</P>
<P>And Slovenian has a special purpose "dual" that is used for all numbers ending in two.</P>
<P>To put into programming a bit, Jeff Boulter has talked about it in his&nbsp;<A class="" href="http://boulter.com/blog/2005/04/22/5-ways-to-pluralize/" mce_href="http://boulter.com/blog/2005/04/22/5-ways-to-pluralize/">5 way(s) to pluralize</A>, and I just noticed that <A class="" href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/tomwhite/archive/2006/07/pluralization.html" mce_href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/tomwhite/archive/2006/07/pluralization.html">Tom White</A> also quoted a bit of that Allan Sherman sing has even made a plea for people with knowledge of other languages to get involved with Java solutions here.</P>
<P>But C# is out there too -- see dmitryr's&nbsp;<A class="" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dmitryr/archive/2007/01/11/simple-english-noun-pluralizer-in-c.aspx" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dmitryr/archive/2007/01/11/simple-english-noun-pluralizer-in-c.aspx">Simple English Noun Pluralizer in C#</A>, for example, which has a couple of great comments that delve into additional exceptions and other language.</P>
<P>Or fun ones like Bradley Tetzlaff's <A class="" href="http://99-bottles-of-beer.net/language-csharp-956.html" mce_href="http://99-bottles-of-beer.net/language-csharp-956.html">C# 2.0 Ninety Nine Bottles of Beer Example</A>, which shows a very important practical implementation. :-)</P>
<P>Even my own <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/03/13/394822.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/03/13/394822.html">IStemmer'ed the tide</A> talks about how stemming is involved with pluralization (among other things).</P>
<P>The rules are very complex even to get any one language done perfectly, so doing lots of languages is staggering.</P>
<P>Definitely a hard problem to consider. I think I'll leave that one alone, myself, and just try and stem some tides (leaving the stemmering to others!).</P>

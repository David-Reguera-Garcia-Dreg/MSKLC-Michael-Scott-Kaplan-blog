<P>How does that expression go, that you can't keep a good Windows International Open Language tool down?</P>
<P>Well, you may recall back in January of this year when I was saying <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/01/16/1475944.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/01/16/1475944.html">Please excuse the interruption</A></STRONG> how the Locale Builder beta had expired.</P>
<P>The tortuous wait is now over, and the Microsoft Locale Builder is now back!</P>
<P>Do you think we should call it MLB or MSLB? I prefer the latter so it sounds like MSKLC, but I'm sure people will have their own opinions....</P>
<P>In any case, you can get it <A class="" href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=96654" mce_href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=96654">right here</A>&nbsp;from the download center, and I am sure other sites will be up soon (I'll update with additional&nbsp;links as they are made available).</P>
<P>Congrats to all the work behind the scenes to make this happen and thanks! Entirely too many people had to do&nbsp;a lot of&nbsp;work that I can't even talk about to make the tool available again. And I am incredibly glad they did. :-)</P>
<P>I started with a half-hearted version of the Mark Morrison song (Return of the Mack) but my heart wasn't in it (in part because it forced me to use MLB the way it was shaping and in part because the themes of that song don't seem entirely appropriate here!)....</P>

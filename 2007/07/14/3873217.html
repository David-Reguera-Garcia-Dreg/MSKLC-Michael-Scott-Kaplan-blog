<h1>Code pages don't overlap all that much</h1>

<P>It was over two years ago that I mentioned how <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/03/01/382289.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/03/01/382289.html"><STRONG>code pages are really not enough</STRONG></A>.&nbsp;But it is still&nbsp;a problem that comes up all the time....</P>
<P>Ahmet's question is very representative of the situation:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times"><EM>I need help for an encoding issue while creating a text file. A customer of mine is creating a text file with some strings and integer values. He is calculating byte representation of the integer and writing it to a text file.<BR><BR>For example, integer value is 222 and string contains “ĞİÜ”. If the customer uses ISO-8859-9 to keep Turkish characters unchanged, binary repr. of 222 changes to question mark, instead of Ş. However, if he uses ISO-8859-1, 222 is written as Ş but the Turkish characters are changed to nearest characters, for example, Ğ changes to G, İ changes to I (however, strangely, Ü stands same).</EM></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This really shows the most fundamental problem with&nbsp;code pages and multilingual text, doesn't it?</P>
<P>There is no one code page that contain all the characters in Unicode, with the exception of:</P>
<UL>
<LI>GB18030 (which promises a 1-to-1 mapping with Unicode), </LI>
<LI>UTF-16 (which is what Microsoft calls "Unicode"), and</LI>
<LI>UTF-8/UTF-32 (the other encoding forms of Unicode)</LI></UL>
<P>Any time you try to use some other code page, there are tens of thousands of characters that will not be able to survive the operation....</P>
<P>One last point of interest -- Ahmet's observation that <STRONG>Ü</STRONG> strangely is not affected. This is not all that strange, since both <A class="" href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/reference/iso/28591.mspx" mce_href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/reference/iso/28591.mspx">ISO 8859-1</A> and <A class="" href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/reference/iso/28599.mspx" mce_href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/reference/iso/28599.mspx">ISO 8859-9</A> both contain Ü in them -- these code pages really were designed to support various languages and that is a letter that happens to be used by several languages (in the case of this letter at a minimum both German and Turkish use it, though there are several others!).</P>

<p><strong>Christoph P&#228;per</strong> on 15 Jul 2007 6:27 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Amongst ISO 8859, German is really well supported. The umlauts and eszett are not only included in every Latin variant, they even stay in the same places.</p></div>

<P>Subconscious efforts on the part of German standards folks? :-)</P></div>
<p><strong>Cristian Secară</strong> on 16 Jul 2007 12:28 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Codepoint 222 (DE hex) is Ş (S with cedilla below) in ISO-8859-9 (Latin 5), but &#222; (Latin capital letter Thorn) in ISO-8859-1 (Latin 1).</p>
<p>Not that this would changes much the rest :)</p>

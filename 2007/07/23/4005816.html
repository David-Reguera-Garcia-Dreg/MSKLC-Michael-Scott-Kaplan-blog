<h1>Going to Réunion?</h1>

<P>No, this post is not about my 20-year high school reunion, that is coming up next year. </P>
<P>In fact they are starting to gear up for that, though.&nbsp;I just saw that former classmate Melanie Rosenberg Luria&nbsp;is involved with the planning and they are looking for some assistance.</P>
<P>Maybe I should offer to help out a bit, something that might be nice since I kind of blew off the 10-year.</P>
<P>But like I said this post is not about that kind of reunion.</P>
<P>It is about developer Tracey's question about the Reunion region entry in Regional and Language Options:</P>
<P><IMG height=818 src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/reunion.png" width=421></P>
<P>She wondered what that was about -- was it the region you use when you are at high school reunions?</P>
<P>Actually, it is not. Though that would be funny for reasons that I will talk about another time involving RAS and networking and phone books and such....</P>
<P>It is actually talking about <A class="" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Réunion" mce_href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Réunion">Réunion</A>, the island east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean, one of the overseas départements of France. </P>
<P>It is on that list for the same reason that one sees Puerto Rico, Taiwan, Antarctica,&nbsp;or any number of different regions that appear on the list -- because a setting covering where you are at needs to cover a lot of the places you might be.</P>
<P>The <STRONG><FONT size=5>é</FONT></STRONG> becomes an <STRONG><FONT size=5>e</FONT></STRONG> most likely because of the US tendency to drop diacritics at the drop of a hat, even though the rest of the English-speaking world is less likely to do that. The French version of Windows might have fixed this since it is a localizable resource, though the context they seem to be given is piss-poor enough that if they missed it I wouldn't tend to blame them. :-)</P>
<P>I tend to consider the lack of other strings&nbsp;<STRONG>and</STRONG> the lack of&nbsp;an acute to be&nbsp;core issues, as well as the fact that most regions have both friendly names and official ones and it seems like Réunion could use that kind of thing....</P>
<P>In any case, the reason for an entry for <STRONG>Reunion</STRONG> is that it is an entry for <STRONG>Réunion</STRONG>!</P>

<p>Now we need a version of Windows that doesn't drop the letter 'u' at the drop of a hat, or carelessly invert &quot;re&quot; :-P</p>
<p>R&#233;union's loss of an accent is more acute (haha) when you notice that S&#227;o Tom&#233; and Pr&#237;ncipe still has all 3.</p></div>

<P>That's right, the <A class="" href="http://www.typesociety.org/" mce_href="http://www.typesociety.org/">Society of Typographic Aficionados</A> (SOTA) is putting on <A class="" href="http://www.typecon.com/" mce_href="http://www.typecon.com/">TypeCon 2007</A> August 1st-5th at the <A class="" href="http://www.ichotelsgroup.com/h/d/cp/1/en/hd/seadt" mce_href="http://www.ichotelsgroup.com/h/d/cp/1/en/hd/seadt">Seattle Crown Plaza Hotel</A>.</P>
<P>And I'm going to be there -- SIAO will be talking about the event!</P>
<P><EM>(I am not a speaker at the event, but there are like more than 85 people who are and who are more qualified than I to do so!)</EM></P>
<P>I didn't get press credentials or anything like that, though I'll see what I can do about blog entries as the conference progresses, as there are a lot of interesting things going on. :-)</P>
<P>If you're going to be there, let me know (if you would like to be there, they extended the regular registration until tomorrow (details <A class="" href="http://www.typecon.com/talk/?p=108" mce_href="http://www.typecon.com/talk/?p=108">here</A>).</P>
<P>In their own words:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><EM>The typographic center of the universe is at <STRONG>TypeCon2007: Letter Space</STRONG>. More than 85 amazing speakers will be in Seattle for SOTA’s ninth annual conference, including Marian Bantjes, David Berlow, Roger Black, Robert Bringhurst, Matthew Carter, Art Chantry, and Modern Dog. We've extended regular registration so that more people can enjoy an affordable week of presentations, workshops, panel discussions, exhibitions, and special events.</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Now someone mentioned the other day that this blog seemed like the collationary center of the universe and I don't think his choice of words can be put down as a mere accident. In my opinion,&nbsp;you can think of SIAO being at TypeCon2007 as&nbsp;a reasonably geeky kind of <A class="" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_Convergence" mce_href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_Convergence">harmonic convergence</A>, one that was too cool for even the Mayan calendar to make note of.</P>
<P>I suspect the universe will not explode, in any case....</P>
<P>I'll be the one with the scooter and the MacBookPro with Mac OS X Tiger, Vista 32-bit, and Vista 64-bit partitions!</P>
<P>So, see you at <A class="" href="http://www.typecon.com/" mce_href="http://www.typecon.com/">TypeCon 2007</A>, whether you are my "type" or not! :-)</P>

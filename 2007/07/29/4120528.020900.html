<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Yes, here is where you can suggest a topic for future coverage by <EM>Sorting it all Out</EM>. I will allow any item that even remotely&nbsp;makes sense for me to cover, and will probably remove items after they are covered. We'll see how it goes, I am new at this....</FONT></P>

<p>However, there is one little issue that I notice almost daily.</p>
<p>As I am constantly switching between English, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese, I usually always &quot;Restore the [IME] language bar&quot; on the desktop. Hence, it is not minimized to the tray. This is my preferred setting.</p>
<p>Whenever I watch a movie in Media Player, I set the screen to full size. This works well; however, the IME bar never disappears instead overlays the video. As there is not much opportunity to type anything while watching a movie in full screen, I think it would be best if the IME would become invisible.</p>
<p>I do not remember anymore, but I do not recall having this type of problem in XP. Other than manually minimizing it, is there anything that can be done to solve this tiny but constant issue? Not sure if this would be an IME or a Media Player issue.</p></div>

So Microsoft eventually releases an update for our culture when ..it happens.</p>
<p>You mean that all existing e.g. Excel spreadsheets with currency/accounting data will show up in^H^Hwith euros instead of krowns? I can't believe there were no support calls regarding this. Unless nobody is actually using these formats. :)</p>
<p>So any note on how similar transitions works, or if/how multiple currencies per region are handled, would be helpful. Thanks!</p>

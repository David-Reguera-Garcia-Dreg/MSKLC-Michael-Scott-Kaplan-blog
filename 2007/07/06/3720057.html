<P>People who have been reading here for a while know that I am pretty down on the way Windows supports calendars. Posts like <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/01/14/353347.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/01/14/353347.html">Calendars on Win32 -- Not all there yet</A></STRONG> and <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/01/14/353216.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/01/14/353216.html">Calendars on Win32 -- just there for show....</A></STRONG> make it clear that the limitations in the way calendars are implemented simply bother me any time I think about them.</P>
<P>And as posts like <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/02/23/378804.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/02/23/378804.html">Calendars.NET -- new platform, new issues</A></STRONG> show, I don't think the situation really improved all that much under .NET. </P>
<P>The underlying architecture&nbsp;of calendars on&nbsp;both platforms&nbsp;is just really not inspiring.</P>
<P>However, calendars themselves fascinate me. </P>
<P>In fact, were it not for the fact that there are a few other things that capture more of my fascination (e.g. collation and linguistics), I'd actually be trying to push vision documents and architecture proposals for how I see calendars working in the future. It is a very interesting area that deserves the time and attention, generally.</P>
<P>Maybe one day I'll talk about some of my thoughts in this space, too. Just to mix it up&nbsp;a bit!</P>
<P>In any case,&nbsp;when Shelby Eaton (our SDET who owns calendars) set up a two hour meeting for people in my old group to talk with <A class="" href="http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~nachumd/" mce_href="http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~nachumd/">Nachum Dershowitz</A> (co-author of <A class="" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0521777526" mce_href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0521777526">Calendrical Calculations</A>), I knew I had to be there.</P>
<P><EM>(And yes, I had him sign my copy of his book!)</EM></P>
<P>That book, in both of its editions, not only was of tremendous help in learning about calendars, but&nbsp;they have actually helped lots of other people as my copies kept getting borrowed by people over the course of the last few years....</P>
<P>Anyway, the whole&nbsp;conversation was really fascinating, and I suspect it may even be ongoing as people work to determine what happens next with calendars, and how to make for a better international experience in the future for calendars in both managed and unmanaged code.</P>

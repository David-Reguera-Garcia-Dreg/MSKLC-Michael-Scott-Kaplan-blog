<FONT face="Comic Sans MS">
<P>It is a known fact that some people hate Comic Sans MS (why else have a website like <A href="http://www.bancomicsans.com/">http://www.bancomicsans.com/</A> if everyone loved it?).</P>
<P>Though as Mark Liberman pointed out yesterday in Language Log in his post entitled&nbsp;<A class="" href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004688.html" mce_href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004688.html">Font Rage</A>, some people are choosing to be pretty extreme.</P>
<P>I happen to like the font -- it is my main font in email in Outlook, and just like <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/05/09/593108.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/05/09/593108.html">last year</A></STRONG>&nbsp;I still pine for the day that they make Comic Sans Fixed a reality:</P>

<P>This despite the fact that holding my breath waiting would likely prove fatal....</P>
<P>I'll dig up another instance of font rage in a few hours.</P>

<p>If I remember correctly, Comic Sans MS was first bundled with Microsoft Windows 95 OSR2, which included Comic Chat, a grossly RFC-neglecting IRC client that called channels “rooms” and represented users with graphic cartoon characters. Comic Sans MS was used there as the default font for users’ phrases.</p>
<p>To facilitate consistency in character appearance, Comic Chat transmitted an encoded string every time one opted to change one’s appearance. Users of other IRC clients saw this string raw and were often annoyed.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Comic Chat disappeared in Windows 2000, but the font remained “for backward compatibility” as it became widely used by web sites. Occasionally, one also sees paper-based advertisements printed in Comic Sans MS.</p>

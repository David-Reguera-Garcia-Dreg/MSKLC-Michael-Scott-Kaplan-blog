<P><EM>(Does anyone not think that the word "Sansless" is freaking hilarious, like The La Trattoria in Mickey Blue Eyes?!?)</EM>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Ok, font joke of the day, which was constructed by yours truly (Michael Kaplan) and Carolyn Parsons:</P>
<P>Q - Why did</P>
<P mce_keep="true">&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times" size=8>&nbsp;&nbsp; Times New Roman</FONT> </P>
<P mce_keep="true">&nbsp;</P>
<P>go out with</P>
<P mce_keep="true">&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT face="courier new,courier" size=8>&nbsp; Courier New</FONT></P>
<P mce_keep="true">&nbsp;</P>
<P>?</P>
<P mce_keep="true">&nbsp;</P>
<P>A - He wanted to be more <STRONG>Open</STRONG> and was dating against <STRONG>Type</STRONG>.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">&nbsp;</P>
<P>Q - Why did</P>
<P mce_keep="true">&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times" size=8>&nbsp;&nbsp; Times New Roman</FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P mce_keep="true">&nbsp;</P>
<P>eventually break up with&nbsp;</P>
<P mce_keep="true">&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT face="courier new,courier" size=8>&nbsp; Courier New</FONT></P>
<P mce_keep="true">&nbsp;</P>
<P>?</P>
<P mce_keep="true">&nbsp;</P>
<P>A - She was way too&nbsp;<STRONG>Fixed</STRONG> in her ways, and really had no sense of <STRONG>Proportion</STRONG>.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">&nbsp;</P>
<P>{Insert groan here}</P>
<P mce_keep="true">&nbsp;</P>
<P>Unsurprisingly, the Fall 2007 Fox Sitcom (<STRONG>Dating Against Type</STRONG>, the endearing comedy of a bunch of young fonts learning about life and love and smooth clean lines and&nbsp;parents suggesting they practice&nbsp;"sans" sex)&nbsp;was cancelled when&nbsp;studio execs&nbsp;heard rumors&nbsp;about this kind of humor being the cornerstone of the series.</P>
<P>Maybe if the pitch had been clips like this they would have gone for it:</P><EMBED name=efp pluginspage=http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer align=middle src=http://www.ifilm.com/efp width=448 height=365 type=application/x-shockwave-flash flashvars="flvbaseclip=2826814" bgcolor="000000" quality="high"></EMBED> 
<P mce_keep="true">Or the other version:</P>

<embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/pMBGcN7x-Ow" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></OBJECT>
<P mce_keep="true">On the&nbsp;other&nbsp;hand, this is&nbsp;Fox we're talking about....&nbsp;</P>
<P mce_keep="true">I wonder whether either of these two videos can legitimately be considered <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/07/06/3723277.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/07/06/3723277.html">font rage</A></STRONG>? :-)</P>

<p>I smiled &gt;.&gt;</p></div>
<p><strong>Serif Sam</strong> on 6 Jul 2007 1:35 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Courier New, we’ll miss her. </p>
<p>I guess it all started with her employer IBM. Sure they made her, but cast her into the public domain, where with no trademarkable name she soon fell into disrepute. </p>
<p>She loved sport, started out hawking golf balls, loved baseball and famously threw out the fixed-pitch at a minor league ballgame. </p>
<p>With Times New Roman, an older man, I guess it was never going to work out. Courier kept mono-spacing in the middle of conversations. She tried to change but his command-line wasn’t appreciated. When she was replaced by a new font, nothing could console her. </p>
<p>Cheers, Sam</p></div>

<p>Oh yeah, when that happens you need to do something with a bunny and a pancake, right? :-)</p>

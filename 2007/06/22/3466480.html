<h1>Your VC++ files don't support Unicode identifers? Drop a BOM on them!</h1>
<p><em>by Michael S. Kaplan, published on 2007/06/22 15:10 -04:00, original URI: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/michkap/archive/2007/06/22/3466480.aspx</em></p>
<hr/> <!-- Archival Source: ProcessPostNew -->
<P>What with Unicode being the default way that things are compiled in Visual Studio, the fact that identifiers were limited to ANSI has really been a sore point for a lot of people.</P>
<P>Including me. :-)</P>
<P>Thankfully, VC++ Architect Mark Hall helped set me straight on a not-entirely-well documented feature in the latest version of Visual C++.</P>
<P>If you don't like the lack of Unicode identifiers, then all you have to do is drop a BOM on your UTF-8 source!</P>
<P>You can read more about it in the topic <A class="" href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/xwy0e8f2(VS.80).aspx" mce_href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/xwy0e8f2(VS.80).aspx">Unicode Support in the Compiler and Linker</A>.</P>
<P>And you do need the BOM for UTF-8 in this case (no matter how controversial that requirement may be). As one of the cool test leads over there pointed out:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><EM>...we don’t support UTF8 w/o BOM, since it’s pretty much indistinguishable from ANSI</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Note that you do not need a BOM for UTF-16LE or UTF16-BE. </P>
<P>In theory the BOM probably shouldn't be needed for UTF-8 given how easy UTF-8 detection is, but since NLS didn't provide a function I can hardly blame them for not wanting to go off and write their own (note that it *should* in my opinion be a part of <A class="" href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms776445.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms776445.aspx">IsTextUnicode</A>, as I have pointed out <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/01/30/363308.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/01/30/363308.html">before</A></STRONG>. But I don't know when (or even if) that might be happening.</P>
<P>Maybe I'll just post a little IsTextUtf8 function in the meantime. :-)</P>
<P>The other problem would be that all of the important docs that refer to things like identifiers are still making ASCII assumptions in <A class="" href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/565w213d(VS.71).aspx" mce_href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/565w213d(VS.71).aspx">7.1</A>, <A class="" href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/565w213d(vs.80).aspx" mce_href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/565w213d(vs.80).aspx">8.0</A>, <A class="" href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/565w213d.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/565w213d.aspx">8.5</A>, and even current (preliminary) <A class="" href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/565w213d(vs.90).aspx" mce_href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/565w213d(vs.90).aspx">9.0</A> docs.</P>
<P>So one should not assume that the full support of <A class="" href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr31" mce_href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr31">Unicode Standard Annex #31 (Identifier and Pattern Syntax)</A> is being implemented, but hopefully some not entirely incompatible subset is what would turn out to be available....</P>
<P>I'll say more on this soon, both as soon as I find out what the answers are and as soon as I get the doc story to be updated (I assume the former will happen prior to the latter).</P>

<p>But I am being given the rules and will be able to blog about them this weekend.... :-)</p>
<p>I agree that the RC and RichEdit stuff needs a high priority.Luckily the folks who have to do work here are all on different teams....</p>

<p>Luckily the folks who have to do work here are all on different teams....&quot;</p>
<p>In order to fix it, the bug should first be accepted as bug.</p>
<p>Which is not, in this case.</p></div>

<p>RC.EXE/RCDLL.DLL are actually OS-provided components that VC/VS pick up from the OS. I'm on it....</p>
</div>
<p><a id="3486272" href="#3486272">#</a> <strong>Mihai</strong> on 23 Jun 2007 2:45 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>&quot;RC.EXE/RCDLL.DLL are actually OS-provided components that VC/VS pick up from the OS. I'm on it....&quot;</p>
<p>Good to know. </p>
<p>I just did not have any idea that RCDLL.DLL also saves the files from the resource editor. And I did not imagine that RCDLL.DLL is that one that puts a warning message dialog if characters are lost. Maybe RCDLL.DLL returns an error and the UI part (Res Editor?) ignores it.</p>
<p>OK, I will wait and I will test the next release :-)</p></div>
<p><a id="3486390" href="#3486390">#</a> <strong>Mihai</strong> on 23 Jun 2007 2:50 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>On another note, it would be really-really nice to have some public interface to RCDLL.DLL. It would save so much grief to all the localization/validation tools vendors that have to create proprietary RC parsers (most of the times buggy).</p>
<p>It might alleviate the problem with the Resource Editor not exposing any kind of automation, events, extensibility, like the rest of the IDE.</p>
<p>(although the right thing would still be to become part of the IDE Automation Model)</p></div>

<p>RC.exe can properly compile .rc files saved as UTF-16LE (strangely not UTF8-with-BOM though), but VS just can't edit them. I found this out while writing a database-to-.rc localization tool.</p>
<p>Remember to take out the &quot;#pragma code_page(..)&quot; bit.</p></div>
<p><a id="3522689" href="#3522689">#</a> <strong>Mihai</strong> on 25 Jun 2007 12:35 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>@John: I know, rc can compile utf-16 files since (at least) VS6.</p>
<p>But the bug reported is about the VS 2005 (and Orca) resource editor, which can edit utf-16 files.</p>
<p>Read the bug description.</p></div>
<p><a id="3524083" href="#3524083">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 25 Jun 2007 1:35 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Perhaps it is just me, but I rate the bug that Mihai is referring to as being a much lower priority given that for most developers the localization process happens outside of Visual Studio.</p>
<p>In the scheme of things, I give UTF-8 support with rc.exe/rcdll.dll a *much* higher priority since it is much more likely to impact real users. </p>
<p>The &quot;not automatically noticing the file format is insufficient&quot; is a minor issue, and the &quot;choice of default file format&quot; is also much less crucial.</p>
<p>Just my opinion, of course....</p>
</div>
<p><a id="3533627" href="#3533627">#</a> <strong>Mihai</strong> on 25 Jun 2007 9:21 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>About priority: Both of them we have workarounds.</p>
<p>It depends how you look at it.</p>
<p>Not supporting UTF-8 is just ugly. Saving as ANSI a file that contains text outside ANSI (without a warning) results in data loss. Notepad does better.</p>
<p>Personally I don't really care if a file is UTF-16 or UTF-8, as long as my data does not get corrupted and the final application works (I have a much worse bug filed against DLGINIT).</p>
<p>And providing workarounds for VS bugs keeps my web site interesting ;-)</p></div>
<p><a id="3533694" href="#3533694">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 25 Jun 2007 9:30 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Yes, but using VS as the localization TOOL is much less common. So yes it can corrupt, but no it is not corrupting in the most common scenarios....</p>

<P>I was watching a Bones rerun the other night (The Truth in the Lye) and one of those funny language moments came up:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><EM><STRONG>Angela Montenegro</STRONG>: What you thought were teeth marks, Dr. Saroyan, turned out to be Chinese characters engraved along the side.<BR><STRONG>Jack Hodgins</STRONG>: What do they say?<BR><STRONG>Angela Montenegro</STRONG>: They say "what make foolish man think I speak Chinese?"<BR><STRONG>Jack Hodgins</STRONG>: I thought you were half Chinese!<BR><STRONG>Angela Montenegro</STRONG>: And I thnk you're half Swedish. Let's hear some Swedish!<BR><STRONG>Camille Saroyan</STRONG>: What is it Angela, please.<BR><STRONG>Angela Montenegro</STRONG>: Its a chopstick, only its not the kind you eat with.<BR><STRONG>Jack Hodgins</STRONG>: Like there is another kind?<BR><STRONG>Angela Montenegro</STRONG>: Well you wouldn't comb your hair with a fork, would you?<BR><STRONG>Jack Hodgins</STRONG>: My hair?<BR><STRONG>Angela Montenegro</STRONG>: Alright look the one character I was able to translate, off the internet, is the word beauty, then I realize that its meant for hair<BR><STRONG>Camille Saroyan</STRONG>: Where you twist it in a bun and stick it in to hold it in place.</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The things we take for granted without realizing it -- I can't even count the number if times that I have asked people at work if they knew what some text said. I guess I've been lucky so far (though I supoose being the daughter of Billy F. Gibbons of ZZ Top (as Angela is the series) might have been an interesting conversation point, too.... :-)</P>
<P>Here is the chopstick in question:</P>

<P mce_keep="true">I even knew which character Angela found, though I have no idea how or where I learned that particular ideograph for beauty....</P>

It's called &quot;簪&quot; or &quot;钗&quot; or &quot;笄&quot;. I can't really tell the difference, because you can hardly see these things today and I'm a dude.</p></div>

<p>Babelfish gives me &quot;human beauty&quot; for Japanese-to-English, and &quot;Person America&quot; for Chinese-to-English (both Simplified and Traditional).</p>
<p>No entry in EDICT.</p>
<p>Using Google I find lots of entries on Chinese Simplified sites, very few Japanese.</p>
<p>Based on some machine-translated sites and some guessing I will go with &quot;inner beauty&quot; :-)</p></div>

<p><a id="3644109" href="#3644109">#</a> <strong>jonlfh</strong> on 1 Jul 2007 11:34 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Mihai, you're reading it backwards. If you take it as vertically written Chinese (rotate it 90 counterclockwise), it reads 美人 (měir&#233;n or bijin) or &quot;beautiful person&quot;. I'm Singaporean Chinese, by the way.</p></div>
<p><a id="3646298" href="#3646298">#</a> <strong>Mihai</strong> on 1 Jul 2007 2:49 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>&quot;Mihai, you're reading it backwards&quot;</p>
<p>Oups, right :-)</p></div>
<p><a id="3678095" href="#3678095">#</a> <strong>Igor</strong> on 3 Jul 2007 7:43 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Why is that Angela character's last name &quot;Montenegro&quot; when Montenegro is the name of one of the former Yugoslav republic and she is supposedly what, Chinese?!?</p>
<p>Gosh... my sense for humor got confused.</p></div>
<p><a id="3679609" href="#3679609">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 3 Jul 2007 10:22 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>That is a good point -- maybe I should not have put the last names in! :-)</p>
</div>
<p><a id="3734427" href="#3734427">#</a> <strong>Erzengel</strong> on 6 Jul 2007 5:11 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>I'm curious as to how she could find the first character on the internet, but not the second? The second character, 人 (じん, jin) is very common, and 美 (び, bi) is also common, but not quite as common (it's still one of the ~2000 漢字 (kanji) that a highschooler must know to graduate). How could one have found one but not the other?</p>
<p>I'm speaking from Japanese, rather than Chinese, but it does mean Beautiful Person.</p></div>
<p><a id="3756217" href="#3756217">#</a> <strong>Igor</strong> on 7 Jul 2007 11:13 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Nah, it is just the proof that wide audience will tolerate any illogical crap thrown at them from the TV screen in the name of fun and profit.</p></div>

<P>It may not be #1 for the list of words I never expected to here Erik say. But if you had asked me I would have put it in the top five....</P>
<P>As I was passing by his office in the scooter, he said "<EM>Wait, Michael. You have to hear this song from Barry Manilow.</EM>"</P>
<P>The song? It's from the remastered This One's for You, and the name of the song is <STRONG>I Really Do Write The Songs</STRONG>.</P>
<P>It was very cute, and funny given the irony surrounding the fact that his big hit <STRONG>I Write The Songs</STRONG> was not written by him and was not actually about a songwriter anyway. :-)</P>
<P>I listened the song all the way through, since I was kind of hoping he would talk about the bridge and such -- you know, more into the musical side of things. He didn't, but it was okay. It isn't like I bought the album of anything, so my right to ask for things from the man is decidedly limited....</P>
<P>You can see the album on Amazon and even listen to a bit of the track if you like <A class="" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000GG4XEM" mce_href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000GG4XEM">here</A>.</P>
<P>I even wrote up my own version of the lyrics, entitled <STRONG>I Really Do Compare Strings</STRONG> for your entertainment.&nbsp;Probably not <STRONG>too</STRONG> useful if you have never heard the song. But perhaps a little funny....</P>

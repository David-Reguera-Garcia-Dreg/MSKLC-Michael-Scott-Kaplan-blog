<h1>A Windows International-style Ziva-ism</h1>

<P>When English is not one's native language, it can be hard to master all of the slang expressions. </P>
<P>This is something that the CBS series <A class="" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCIS_(TV_series)" mce_href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCIS_(TV_series)">NCIS</A> takes advantage of, with their Mossad Liaison&nbsp;Ziva David (played by Cote de Pablo). It seems there is never an expression she gets right, which strains credulity since&nbsp;more of them probably ought to be right when she tries them, just by random chance. But it still stays funny when&nbsp;it happens. And no one ever really thinks about how hard it is&nbsp;to&nbsp;imagine that one could have such complete command of the idiom while being able to&nbsp;so consistently flub the idiomatic usage....</P>
<P>Apparently her fans call these idiomatic slips Ziva-isms. :-)</P>
<P>Anyway, the NLS team has some of these too, on occasion. So perhaps they are not so rare....</P>
<P>Like earlier this year when a coding milestone was reached and the team was congratulated for reaching the milestone ahead of schedule. One of our non-native English speakers pointed out:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt; COLOR: #1f497d; FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri','sans-serif'">NLS is rocks </SPAN><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt; COLOR: #1f497d; FONT-FAMILY: Wingdings">J</SPAN></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P mce_keep="true">Now one of the other team members, also not an native English&nbsp;speaker, nevertheless did notice the idiom cache miss here, and quickly corrected it:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P mce_keep="true"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt; COLOR: #1f497d; FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri','sans-serif'">Yes, we rock ;-) </SPAN></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P mce_keep="true">Unfortunately, he then made a tiny slip of his own while trying to make a joke after recognizing not only the idiom here but another different but related one:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P mce_keep="true"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt; COLOR: #1f497d; FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri','sans-serif'">But we are not stones ;-)</SPAN></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P mce_keep="true"><EM>(I think he meant to say that although the team rocks, they are not stoned. which does show certain command of idiom even if as few details are missed!)</EM></P>
<P mce_keep="true">I daresay, a Windows International-style Ziva-ism!</P>
<P mce_keep="true">And in that case, calling it a WIva-ism makes for a nice <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/08/03/687388.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/08/03/687388.html"><STRONG>back-formation</STRONG></A>, doesn't it? :-)</P>

<p>For example: </p>
<p>We cool</p>
<p>in slang means We are cool or, dependent on context, can be everything is cool between us.</p>
<p>So We Rock </p>
<p>can be We are made of Rock, We are Rocks.</p>
<p>Thus it should be pointed out that We are not stones.</p></div>

<p>How does that work, exactly?</p>

So he could be just explaining this is a grammar mistake and NLS is NOT stones - no punt, jokes or references to drugs was intented.</p>

<p>It reminds me one silly problem I've got yesterday.</p>
<p>I've installed a self made keyboard layout on WinXP, and assigned a shortcut key to it.</p>
<p>Then uninstalled it and, few days (and reboots) later, installed a new version. Now I can't assign the same shortcut key! &nbsp;Windows says that this key is assigned to some another item. Zayin!</p>
<p>Where these shortcut keys are stored? How to wipe them away?</p>
<p>Is there any simple scripting interface to assign and remove these shortcuts?</p>

<p>So you should ask the original team member what the idea was. &nbsp;It might not have been about stoned (in the drug-indulging sense) at all.</p>

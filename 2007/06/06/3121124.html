<h1>My heart palpitates at the thought of receiving 'Zugesagt: The big feature!'</h1>

<P>There are all kinds of special messages that Microsoft Outlook will send. </P>
<P>Like when you accept a meeting request, or reject one, or propose a new time.</P>
<P>The interesting (well, maybe not so interesting) part about this is that it is done in the UI language of the sender, not of the receiver.</P>
<P>So I send out a meeting request entitled <STRONG>The Big Meeting!</STRONG> and eagerly await responses.</P>
<P>Some come back as <STRONG>Accepted: The Big Meeting!</STRONG> and others as <STRONG>Declined: The Big Meeting!</STRONG>&nbsp;and so on.</P>
<P>And then when colleague Erik over on the MUI team responds, it says <STRONG>Zugesagt: The Big Meeting!</STRONG> and this is because Erik has his UI language set to German.</P>
<P>Now keep in mind this is NOT what Outlook does with&nbsp;date formats or time zones associated with the date of the item when it is received -- those items are based on the receiver's settings.</P>
<P>Since the purpose of a message is to communicate, I think it really is a much better design to use the settings of the receiver of the message, so that even if I do not know what&nbsp;<STRONG>Zugesagt</STRONG> means I still can get the intended message.</P>
<P>As designs go that just makes more sense to me. The Developer in me imagines potential solutions that might work, the Technical Lead in me imagines who I might talk to if I wanted to see someone consider a change. Or maybe that's the Program Manager. Hey, the tester in me imagines what kinds of weird funky settings could be used to try and break it. </P>
<P>It is very crowded in me, at times like this. :-)</P>
<P>Of course Outlook has been doing it this way for a long time so I don't know how receptive they would be to a change here. But maybe I can hope....</P>

<hr/><p><strong>Mike Dimmick</strong> on 6 Jun 2007 4:04 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>It's embedded in the Subject field, so here we're into parsing the subject field, and as a developer that gives me the heebie-jeebies. Any decision made on user-supplied freeform data is likely to head off into Clippy-style 'It looks like you're writing a letter' territory.</p>
<p>The same problem occurs with the simple prefix 'RE:' which in German is 'AW:' for Antwort and I've seen 'SV:' as well. Not sure if Outlook handles all these now, but in previous versions you could easily see a subject line of 'Re: AW: SV: Re: SV: AW: stuff' as the message made its way across users using different languages.</p>

It is a very controlled environment....</p>

<p><strong>Dean Harding</strong> on 6 Jun 2007 7:47 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Actually calendar-based requests in Outlook follow RFC 2445 (I don't know how closely it follows that standard and whether deviations are already made -- which would make further deviations not such a big deal [perhaps &quot;extensions&quot; would be the better word?])</p>
<p>At least, that's for email that passes through an SMTP server. If it's all done inside exchange, I assume it's something totally different...</p>
<p>But still, it's something that could be done outside of the subject line I suppose.</p>

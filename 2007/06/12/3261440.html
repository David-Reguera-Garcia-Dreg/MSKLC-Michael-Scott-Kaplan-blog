<P><EM>Nothing technical, you know the drill...</EM>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I heard there was a cold going around.</P>
<P>I think I caught it.</P>
<P>Of course I figured out through that weird way I always do -- I had one of those acute onset M.S. exacerbations.</P>
<P>The emotions involved were weird though -- first it was excitement that a new exacerbation would indicate I was still in the <STRONG>secondary progressive</STRONG> category, then it was unhappiness that my vacation/reset the Novantrone provided was done, finally it was the realization that neither of these things were true -- I just had a fever and the M.S. symptoms were&nbsp;inspired&nbsp;by that.</P>
<P>So, feeling too guilty to get paid while home sick I took it as sick time, but feeling too bored to do nothing I stayed on mail and answered lots of questions.</P>
<P>But then I also picked up some of the videos that were on my list, such as the SNL <A class="" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/More_Cowbell" mce_href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/More_Cowbell">More Cowbell</A> one that inspired the title.</P>
<P>And I got to watch The O.C. on SoapNet, and I realized how awful it is to have The O.C. in a format that has a season done in like five weeks -- because the show went in four seasons from brilliant to pretty good to glimmer of what once was to I can't believe I'm still watching this show now that Marissa is gone and it is a hollow shell of what it once was. That is simply too much of a history to have on every day such that the cycle has to be repeated 3-4 times a year. It is just sad, and if art's main purpose is to evoke pity and terror, then The O.C. on SoapNet had become art on several levels and I am glad that I am not home every day to watch it....</P>
<P>I also got a chance to watch <A class="" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Kepple" mce_href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Kepple">Andrew Kepple</A>'s masterpiece <A class="" href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/222458" mce_href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/222458">Zero Wing Rhapsody</A>&nbsp;-- as Andrew put into the hidden credits, it is <STRONG>Obscure Internet cult meets megafamous musical cult. The perfect match.</STRONG> I'm sorry I waited so long, that was hilarious.</P>
<P>Someone had pointed out to me that the whole All you base are belong to us thing with:</P>
<UL>
<LI>The original Japanese text</LI>
<LI>The cheesy Engrish translation that became an Internet phenomenon</LI>
<LI>A literal English translation</LI>
<LI>an alternative "free text" translation, intended to capture the spirit of the original</LI></UL>
<P>are all in the Wikipedia article, <A class="" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_your_base_are_belong_to_us" mce_href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_your_base_are_belong_to_us">here</A>. A fascinating study in both good and bad translations. :-)</P>
<P>Some of the questions I answered may turn into future blog posts, names changed to protect everyone.</P>
<P>I'll base whether I am at work tomorrow on how much better I am feeling (and if the fever is gone, I don't want to make anyone else sick if I can help it)....</P>

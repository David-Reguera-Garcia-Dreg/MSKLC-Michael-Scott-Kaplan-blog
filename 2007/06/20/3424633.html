<P>Someone showed me a special sequence off the Forever Charmed DVD where they were doing interviews with cast and crew and fans, after the show was ending. An interesting bit From Rose McGowan (Paige Matthews) on seeing herself in the different language versions of Charmed (text approximate since I only got to listen to it a few times):</P>

<P><EM><FONT face="times new roman,times">I've seen myself in Spanish, in Bulgarian. In German, and French. And the French she does a great job -- I mean they are all great, it's just obviously it's easier on the ears in certain languages versus others -- and the Italian sounds like me. And it's interesting because they had the same person do you throughout the run of the series, so I guess she's out of a job too....</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>I've always thought this is a really interesting form of translation/localization that needs people to really know&nbsp;a lot more about culture than even&nbsp;a complex software localization product.</P>
<P>I've never met Rose but I've seen her in several movies and of course on Charmed, and I used to run across her mom from time to time when I was working (I was a fan of her work too, even if she wasn't as famous for it!).</P>

Here in Hungary, every single show and movie on TV is dubbed into Hungarian. Not that the Hungarian dubbing is worse than other dubbing (sometimes it's claimed to be outstanding), but I've started to really hate dubbing some time ago.</p>
<p>I'm actually quite alone with this in my surrounding, and this might be the smuggiest thing about me, but come on... putting words into someone else's mouth in a different language (and thereby breaking the original directorial vision, breaking the original acting performance, and creating a totally new something) -- it's a bit childish, I believe.</p>
<p>And the worst thing is, you don't have a choice. Fortunately, cinemas rarely show dubbed films, but the TV is horrible. DVDs are the best, as they let you have a choice.</p>
<p>Down with the dubbing! Go subtitled original-voice movies!</p></div>

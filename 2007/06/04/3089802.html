<P>Just the other day, Cristian Secară, regular reader from Romania asked me about a newsgroup post in microsoft.public.windows.inetexplorer.ie6.browser <A class="" href="http://www.microsoft.com/communities/newsgroups/list/en-us/default.aspx?dg=microsoft.public.windows.inetexplorer.ie6.browser&amp;tid=e15a378d-0574-4047-a141-b0def779f5bd&amp;cat=en_us_41c3ac23-46c0-48c4-9f96-5734a3d7fafd&amp;lang=en&amp;cr=us&amp;sloc=en-us&amp;p=1" mce_href="http://www.microsoft.com/communities/newsgroups/list/en-us/default.aspx?dg=microsoft.public.windows.inetexplorer.ie6.browser&amp;tid=e15a378d-0574-4047-a141-b0def779f5bd&amp;cat=en_us_41c3ac23-46c0-48c4-9f96-5734a3d7fafd&amp;lang=en&amp;cr=us&amp;sloc=en-us&amp;p=1">here</A>&nbsp;he wrote&nbsp;that said:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>My system is set to Romanian locale, that means 24 hours, time separated <BR>with :, date separated with ., comma for decimal separator, etc.. <BR><BR>When viewing ftp locations with Opera or Firefox, the date and time of <BR>displayed items are correctly represented on my system, for example [file] <BR>4.109 KB 16.05.2007 14:27:00. <BR>However, when viewing the same with IE, the English representation is used, <BR>which is very confusing for me. The same above example will give 05/16/2007 <BR>02:27 4,207,104 [file]. <BR><BR>How can this be corrected ? Works the same with IE 6 and/or IE7. <BR><BR>Cristi </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>There were no replies....</P>
<P>Anyway, Cristi is right, no matter what one's default user locale or default system locale settings may be, whether one looks at IE6:&nbsp;</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/ftp_ie6.png"></P>
<P>or IE7:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/ftp_ie7.png"></P>
<P>it never picks up the locale settings or time zone settings of the machine upon which you are running.</P>
<P>Although something very weird about this -- on one of my machines (XP SP2 with IE6), the FTP site was actually showing up with Explorer, and it was supporting all of settings for time zone and user locale date formatting.</P>
<P>Everything worked properly, while it was in this odd FTP mode.</P>
<P>I call it odd for two reasons:</P>
<OL>
<LI>It went away when I tried switching to classic from the XP theme, and</LI>
<LI>I could not find any setting that took it back to the way it was!</LI></OL>
<P>It apparently was not the <STRONG>Enable folder view for FTP sites</STRONG> and it also apparently wasn't <STRONG>Use Passive FTP (for firewall and DSL modem compatibility)</STRONG>. I tried playing with lots of other settings and nothing gave me back the right locale support via the Windows Explorer of my FTP sites....</P>
<P>I don't know if that IE web page that comes up on all of machines now is part of some old FTP standard that Microsoft never updated, or just&nbsp;or how to get the cool Shell mode to work.</P>
<P>I do NOT want to get this support by installing add-ins -- I want the built-in stuff.</P>
<P>Does anyone know what I am talking about?&nbsp;And how to get it back?</P>

<p>Though, when I access FTP sites through IE, I see this message at the top of the page:</p>
<p>&quot;To view this FTP site in Windows Explorer, click Page, and then click Open FTP Site in Windows Explorer.&quot;</p>
<p>Anyway, I don't really like the IE or Windows Explorer FTP client. It seems to open up lots of connections to the server, which can play havoc on servers that limit the number of allowed connections. I prefer specific FTP clients where I can control the number of connections.</p>

<p>But when I look at the site through Windows Explorer, it still opens that text view....</p>
<p>At least I know I am not crazy.... :-)</p>

<p><strong>Dean Harding</strong> on 6 Jun 2007 3:12 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Hmm, that's odd... it works 100% for me, XP SP2 and Vista. I do have the &quot;enable folder view for FTP sites&quot; checked -- that only seems to affect Windows Explorer, not Internet Explorer.</p>

<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 6 Jun 2007 4:09 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Very odd -- is it on all pages? Or just some of them?</p>

<p><strong>Dean Harding</strong> on 6 Jun 2007 8:47 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Well, all the ones I've tried at least...</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 6 Jun 2007 11:16 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Damn. This means it was something in my config that I messed up when I switch to the XP theme, plus there is some other config reason why it is not available.</p>
<p>I wonder what it is?</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 15 Jun 2007 7:04 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Ok, I at least found SOMETHING -- a menu option:</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;View|&amp;Open FTP Site in Windows Explorer</p>
<p>which takes you from the non-locale friendly web page version to one that respects my views. :-)</p>

<P><EM>Just a heads-up to Microsoft full-time employees, everyone else can ignore....</EM></P>
<P>I will be presenting at the 2007 Engineering Excellence &amp; Trustworthy Computing Forum, talking about both the security issues and the less dire (but still buggy) consequences of incorrect string comparisons -- both of which make&nbsp;a good seque into the best practices in both unmanaged and managed code.</P>
<P>Think of it like SIAO, but a bit more focused.</P>
<P>And organized!</P>
<P>The session number is IPE05 and is happening at 4pm on Friday, June 29th (last day, last session!) and I will make it worth people's time to not cut out early that day with a very lively session.</P>
<P>If you enjoy the blog, then take the opportunity to enjoy it live (and spell-checked!), :-)</P>
<P><EM>(And if you don't enjoy the blog, then feel free to take the opportunity to heckle, I'll be taking questions at the end.)</EM></P>

<P>So over the weekend, <A id=ctl00___ctl00___ctl01___Comments___Comments_ctl01_NameLink title="A. Skrobov" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/utility/Redirect.aspx?U=http%3a%2f%2fcs.usu.edu.ru%2fhome%2fskrobov%2f" target=_blank rel=nofollow>A. Skrobov</A>&nbsp;asked in the Suggestion Box:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times"><EM>What does ASMO stand for in the names of the Arabic-ASMO codepages? I've been googling for a while and still couldn't find any organization of this name.</EM></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>As far as I know,&nbsp;ASMO&nbsp;is an acronym&nbsp;for <STRONG>A</STRONG>rabic <STRONG>S</STRONG>tandard <STRONG>M</STRONG>etrology <STRONG>O</STRONG>rganization. Though I do not know if the organization still exists under that name or not (there is <A class="" href="http://www.sasmo.org/en/index.php" mce_href="http://www.sasmo.org/en/index.php">SASMO</A> which is the Syrian organization but I couldn't find a web site for&nbsp;ASMO, myself.</P>
<P>Maybe somebody else knows what happened to ASMO and where it is today. Anyone?</P>

Now at least I can find stories telling that &quot;An Arabic computer standardized code (ASMO-449) was established in 1985 under the Arab Standards and Metrology Organization (ASMO) and the Arabization Coordination Bureau, specialized organizations under the Arab League. However, both died of political and budgetary problems&quot;.</p>
<p>The other question that I asked over the weekend, and the one which seems to have vanished tracelessly, was about the word &quot;transparent&quot; in relation to the Arabic font and codepage names. What does that word really mean, as in &quot;Arabic Transparent&quot; font, and in &quot;transparent ASMO&quot; codepage?</p></div>

<p><a id="1568858" href="#1568858">#</a> <strong>A. Skrobov</strong> on 31 Jan 2007 8:47 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>It seems that I finally found the traces of ASMO: &quot;ASMO was one of the Arab League organizations till 1989 when it was dissolved and replaced by a center attached to The Arab Industrial Development and Mining Organization (AIDMO), called Center for Standardization and Metrology (CSM), with the head-quarter in Rabat.&quot; So, it was just disbanded in 1989.</p>
<p>And thanks again for the insight on transparency!</p></div>

<P>This time it was International MVP Ted who led me (kicking and screaming) over to the MSDN Forums to answer a <A class="" href="http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=1054026" mce_href="http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=1054026">question</A> asked by Phrediac:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FPNT face="Times New Roman,Times" size="2"><I>
<P>I don't know it this is the right place to post - if not apologies.<BR><BR>Can anyone tell me the value of LOCALE_ITIMEMARKERUSE.&nbsp; I can't find it in any Win API include file;&nbsp; Google returns one result, straight out of the MSDN documentation showing what it returns; this site apparently has no mention on it.<BR><BR>Any help would be appreciated.</P></I></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P mce_keep="true">LOCALE_ITIMEMARKERUSE was mentioned in a book about International programming that no one from the international team had ever heard of before (Ted noticed the same reference). And this was not a conspiracy to flush out people who didn't try out their sample code like a map company does adding a fake street here or there to find people who copy their maps, it really was once in the docs.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">But as a constant it had been taken out of the Platform SDK docs, for a simple reason.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">It doesn't exist.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">And as far as&nbsp;I can tell, it never has? Maybe there is an oldtimer who remembers it,&nbsp;but it does not seem to be in the source or headers for any version of NT since 4.0, CE since it first shipped, or Win95 since OSR2 (I don't have ready/immediate access to versions before that for searching purposes).</P>
<P mce_keep="true">I can't find an MSDN link myself, but if someone finds it, I'll try and get it yanked it since it doesn't exist in the code....</P>

<p>BTW, I *really* hate it when maps and books do that. &quot;Hey, there should have been a street between Kennedy Avenue and Jackson Parkway. WTF?&quot;</p></div>

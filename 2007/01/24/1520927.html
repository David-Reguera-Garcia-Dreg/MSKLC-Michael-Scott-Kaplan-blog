<P><EM>(Nothing technical in this post, whatsoever)</EM></P>
<P>Just a quick update on the MS situation, for those who are curious. :-)</P>
<P>Well, first of all, I did get my driver's&nbsp;license after the retest (did better this time that I did the first time, technically!). I still think the state is discriminating (as I said <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/11/14/1074214.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/11/14/1074214.html">before</A></STRONG>, though I know&nbsp;some disagree). For what it is worth, the person who set up the appointment for the test remembered me when I came back and actually went out with me for the test itself. She expressed some dismay over how the other location&nbsp;handled the whole thing, and since I passed she was happy to&nbsp;help me resolve the situation.</P>
<P>At least until 2011 when I get to maybe go through it all again? I'll be sure to go the same office next time, at least!</P>
<P>In other news, I have decided to stop the Novantrone treatments for the time being. They really have done as much good as they will for now. I'd rather save my remaining doses for the future if they are needed (since there is that whole 12 doses lifetime maximum thing I mentioned in my <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/08/03/447149.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/08/03/447149.html"><STRONG>Napalm</STRONG></A> post).</P>
<P>Besides, it's hard to argue that voluntary&nbsp;infusion of a chemotherapy drug is not in some sense intentional&nbsp;self-destructive behavior. :-)</P>
<P>Novantrone has done a good job of acting as&nbsp;something of a&nbsp;RESET button on a lot of my MS symptoms,&nbsp;which has been a good thing. But st this point I think I'd rather hoard those last few infusions I am permitted for some possible future time when the reset button is needed again....</P>

I failed to mention before that although I doubt the drugs help as advertised, I finally went on Copaxone and have been on it for almost 7 years. One more thought: new Copaxone ads state that it is safe and effective long term,&quot;...12 years...&quot; Sooo...what happened to those who started in 1991? (when I was offered it and told THEN others had been on it for years) &nbsp;Did they die? What happened to them? And the ads over 5 years ago that stated &quot;...10 years...&quot; what happened to THEM? Teva won't say. What do you suppose?</p>

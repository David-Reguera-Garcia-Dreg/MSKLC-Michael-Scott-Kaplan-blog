<P>The question that came in the other day:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2>
<P>ok, i read about your theory thing about Hangul, and i was actually having a trouble with installing Korean on my keyboard... i did install Korean, but however, it comes out to be the second type of korean that you talked about where all the letters come out seperately, not connected... also the place of the letters are different from my previous computer... i need to talk to my family in Korea, but i can't type anything correctly in Korean... please help me. i want&nbsp;한국어, not </FONT><FONT face=Dotum size=2>한국어</FONT><FONT size=2>, you know? please help me. thank you</P></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>I am pretty sure this was a reference to that post from this past July (<STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/07/22/674270.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/07/22/674270.html">We're off on the road to Korea! We certainly do get around...</A></STRONG>) or maybe the original one it linked to (<STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/03/12/549951.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/03/12/549951.html">Traditional versus modern sorts</A></STRONG>).</P>
<P>But as far as I know, there is no IME that Microsoft ships in Windows that ever produces separated Jamo (conjoining or otherwise) on anything but incomplete sequences (and even then it is only the non-conjoining ones); they all produce Hangul. Which suggests&nbsp;three possible answers here:</P>
<UL>
<LI>A separate keyboard using MSKLC was produced, in the hopes that it would build up Hangul syllables like an IME might do (and like the Korean IME does);</LI>
<LI>An IME coming from someone other than Microsoft was installed, and it is this IME that is being referred to;</LI>
<LI>Some third possibility that did not occur to me at the time but which a follow up comment (from the original person asking or a reader of this blog)&nbsp;might make clear.</LI></UL>
<P>For now, the solution in any case would be to switch to the built in IME and let it construct Hangul syllables as needed. :-)</P>
<P>On an only somewhat related note, I have gotten lots of positive feedback from&nbsp;native speakers of Korean&nbsp;both inside and outside of Korea who have expressed frustration at the position of standards organizations within Korea and the negative impact it has had within Unicode, ISO's WG2/10646, and within country. The distance between the people working on these standards and the actual users of the language grows every day. </P>
<P>I suppose you could say I serve Microsoft (those less charitable would call me a shill for Microsoft), though&nbsp;since I have been strongly encouraged to keep the customer focus for the entire time I have been here, it is probably more accurate to say I serve customers, or at least try to. Given that, my frustration about the situation grows every day as well....</P>
<P>I also have to wonder whether Apple gets into any trouble given their preference for Normalization Form D, given Korea's antagonism toward it as it applies to Hangul/Jamo? Wouldn't support on the Mac actually force this whole issue once and for all? </P>
<P>Microsoft, as a mostly "Normalization Form C" shop that is kind of late to the Unicode Normalization game in terms of support, has less vested of an interest in the C vs. D debate&nbsp;here than Apple does, other than the whole customer thing I mentioned!</P>
<P>I don't have a Mac or I'd probably be testing this all out more just because&nbsp;it is an interesting area to me&nbsp;(to be honest, at this point I don't know where I would put a Mac if I had one, though I suppose if I won one in a contest or something I'd probably go buy a bigger table!). But are there any Mac users out there who know about the story with Korean on a Mac and how it is supported?</P>

<p>I'm sure you can find room for a Mac Mini, 8 x 11 x 12 :-)</p>

<p>That kind of easy back and forth is the thing that has the Korean standards folks so unhappy....</p>

<p><a id="1394771" href="#1394771">#</a> <strong>Tom Gewecke</strong> on 1 Jan 2007 4:09 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>You're correct, even copy/pasting filenames into a document results in Form D.</p>
<p>You don't need another monitor, you can just switch one of the ones you &nbsp;already have over temporarily or play with the Mini via VNC or something similar:-)</p>
<p>Do you know where I can get a font with OT tables for Old Hangul syllables? &nbsp;I'd like to see if I can get it work on my system.</p></div>
<p><a id="1394964" href="#1394964">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 1 Jan 2007 4:20 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><P>There are ones that the Korean versions of Office used to ship which are no longer available (they are the ones I used for that blog post). Lots of people are trying to get something out there, given all the work in OT and MST to make the functionality work, but I don't know of any publicly available options, yet....</P>
<P>My other computers are all laptops with docking stations and external monitors, which makes the switcher idea impractical unless I were to get that new table (which I wouldn't do unless I won the Mac, as I pointed out!). Plus, I'd probably want a laptop anyway....</P></div>
<p><a id="1400657" href="#1400657">#</a> <strong>Norbert</strong> on 2 Jan 2007 5:36 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Yes, the use of NFD in file names causes problems - they remain NFD when pasted elsewhere, so that searching for them typically doesn't work anymore, even though Korean text in NFC and in NFD renders identically on the Mac.</p>
<p>To get a Mac without another table, you could replace one of your current laptops with a MacBook. All current Macs have Intel CPUs and can run Windows XP along with Mac OS X. Depending on how often you plan to switch between Mac OS and Windows, you can use Apple's Bootcamp software (which requires rebooting) or Nova Development's Parallels Desktop for Mac (which can run both OSes simultaneously).</p></div>

<p>How about Old Hangul? Does it render correctly on the Mac?</p>

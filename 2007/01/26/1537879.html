<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Yes, here is where you can suggest a topic for future coverage by <EM>Sorting it all Out</EM>. I will allow any item that even remotely&nbsp;makes sense for me to cover, and will probably remove items after they are covered. We'll see how it goes, I am new at this....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>(Due to the way the blog server is set up, comments close in 90 days. At this point, a new suggestion page gets set up every 90 days, if I don't forget to create a new one. I'll try to not forget. :-)</FONT></P>

<hr/><p><a id="1879902" href="#1879902">#</a> <strong>IMEless in Tōkyō</strong> on Wednesday, March 14, 2007 6:10 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>The IME bar occasionally disappears. By disappears, I do not mean &nbsp;becomes transparent or hidden; it is really gone. When I click on another application, the IME is available; click back and it is gone. Thus, it must be on a per-application basis. I have no idea how to reproduce it consistently, but I have experienced it on Windows 2000 (JP) and Windows XP (ENG and JP) on multiple machines. I typically hit it once or twice a week. Completely restarting that application fixes it. As well as in XP (not 2000 so far) pressing the IME language change key sequence (such as Alt + Shift) will &quot;often&quot; restore it.</p>
<p>Any ideas what is going on? Is this a known issue? Restarting the application is easy enough, but often not very desirable.</p></div>

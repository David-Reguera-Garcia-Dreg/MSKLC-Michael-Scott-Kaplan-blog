<P>You might remember when I was talking about how <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/12/16/1300320.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/12/16/1300320.html">Thinking about MUI is making me bipolar</A></STRONG>.</P>
<P>Well, I was given the news that the problem was investigated and verified, and some initial work went into determining what the fix might entail.</P>
<P>However, there was not a compelling customer scenario based on actual requirements that I could name. Which means that under the current secret squirrel criteria it is a tough sell to try and get that fix pushed into the product ASAP.</P>
<P>And I can understand that -- me trying to put together a sample for this blog, even if it at the request of customers and even though it found this problem, is not a business justification, not a customer scenario.</P>
<P>It is at best the result of a customer scenario.</P>
<P>And that is of course only true if we can assume the customers who were requesting a sample had actual business reasons behind wanting to get more information on MUI functions and if we can assume that they wanted info on functions like&nbsp;<A href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms776237.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms776237.aspx">SetThreadPreferredUILanguages</A>&nbsp;and&nbsp;if we can assume that&nbsp;their reasons&nbsp;involved wanting to use custom locales/custom cultures.</P>
<P>I can't disagree with&nbsp;the powers that be&nbsp;if they&nbsp;tell me&nbsp;that there are a lot of assumptions in that last paragraph. And that&nbsp;I would need a helluva lot more in the way of customer requests/requirements in hand to be able to attempt to&nbsp;justify getting the fix done sooner rather than later (for example in a service pack, as opposed to a future release).</P>
<P>So, for those who were looking for more information on MUI either after <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/12/16/1300320.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/12/16/1300320.html">that post</A></STRONG>, after <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/05/30/610605.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/05/30/610605.html">this one</A></STRONG>, or even before that, my request is to you.</P>
<P>If you are such a developer or architect and you were really looking into (or wanting to look into) using MUI and custom locales to try and provide a localized version outside the language list provided by Windows, then please let me know, either by commenting here or by sending me info via the <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2004/11/01/280092.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2004/11/01/280092.html">contact link</A></STRONG>. Of if you are part of an internal group at Microsoft then just send me mail, <STRONG>you are eligible too</STRONG>!</P>
<P>I will go to the mat for this one if I&nbsp;can get enough ammunition from customers (inside and outside of Microsoft) to do so. </P>
<P>Help me, Obi Wans, you're my only hope....</P>

<p>I was happy to see that the MUI API is now public, but now I am playing with it, and I see stuff (not much) missing.</p>
<p>And considering the reduced availability of MUI for Vista (only for Ultimate and Enterprise), it seems that the API is even less useful that I initially thought.</p>
<p>And the problems are there even for the languages in the MS list, there is no need to go to custom locales.</p>
<p>So yes, Leia, I will help you :-)</p></div>

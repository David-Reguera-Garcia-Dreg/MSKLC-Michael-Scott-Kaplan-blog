<P><EM><FONT face="times new roman,times" size=2>Hi, I'd like to suggest something that may be in line with your recent 'convert to unicode' posts, although it's very specific, perhaps too specific. Anyway: for a print monitor, the function you pass in the MONITOR2 structure as pfnStartDocPort, gets a &nbsp; DOC_INFO_1 or &nbsp; DOC_INFO_2 structure passed as a LPBYTE. the level parameter tells me wether it's 1 or 2, but what I currently can't find: how do I know if I'll get the A or the W version? I can see nothing to indicate my preference, and if I read the docs right users of printers can pass whatever they want. I'm guessing windows is converting to the one I need, but how does it know what I need?</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The answer&nbsp;-- it is ONLY ever Unicode. </P>
<P><STRONG>CLUE #1</STRONG>: You can tell by the prototype in the documentation for <A class="" href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa506784.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa506784.aspx">StartDocPort</A>&nbsp;and in winsplp.h:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2 fsce="Consolas,Lucida Console,Courier New,Courier"><B>
<P>&nbsp;BOOL&nbsp; (WINAPI *pfnStartDocPort)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HANDLE&nbsp; hPort,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT color=#ff0000>LPWSTR&nbsp; pPrinterName</FONT>,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DWORD&nbsp; JobId,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DWORD&nbsp; Level,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LPBYTE&nbsp; pDocInfo<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; );</P></B></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P mce_keep="true">See that 2nd parameter? It's an LPWSTR.SO this function can only be getting Unicode. </P>
<P mce_keep="true"><STRONG>CLUE #</STRONG>2: The DOC_INFO_1 and DOC_INFO_2 structures choose their Unicodality based on the function called that gets them.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">Since NT-based platforms only support DOC_INFO_1 (according to the docs) combined with the fact that the function is only in newer versions (which feeds into the fact that ANSI is not being added so much anymore)&nbsp;kinda conspires to requiring it all to be Unicode.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">So, to indirectly answer the bigger question that Legolas posed -- to find out if a function takes Unicode or ANSI in otherwise ambiguous cases, one probably just has to do some spelunking around in the SDK and the DDK and the header files. :-)</P>

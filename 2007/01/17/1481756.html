<P>Hi Michal,<BR><BR>we have visual basic 6.0 code. The code comments and code are all in japanese characters. we dont have japanese version of VB 6.0,so the japanese characters are all showing junk characters.<BR><BR>i like to know is there is any possible to view japanese characters without japanese version VB 6.0.if so how its possible .<BR><BR>Reply me<BR><BR>Thanks and Regards</P></I></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P mce_keep="true">First and foremost there is the problem that VB6's IDE does not support Unicode, so your default system code page is really controlling how much you can seed. Changing your default system locale to Japanese and rebooting, or alternately using (the <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/11/09/490791.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/11/09/490791.html"><STRONG>previously discussed</STRONG></A>) AppLocale, is the way to take care of the biggest problem.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">From there you will likely find some sporadic problems with font selections that you&nbsp;may have to change sometimes to see the text.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">But that should make the Japanese comments available to look at.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">Now actually running the application can run into a whole bunch of other problems that might be worthy of a post at some point. </P>
<P mce_keep="true">Come to think of it, just&nbsp;like that <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/12/27/1368334.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/12/27/1368334.html">Converting an Application to Unicode</A> series, if I had an application that I could take through the whole process as a sample, it might actually be a lot of fun to do (not specifically for VB 6.0 of course, I mean for any sort of application!). Though I suspect it might prove even harder to do find such a project then it was for the Unicode conversion....</P>

<P>That isn't it (once again it is one of the full size cultures being returned when only a small subset of properties was needed).</P>
<P>But why Windows only cultures fall back to Invariant is kind of obvious -- because since Windows NLS has no notion of neutral locales, there is no good way to synthesize a neutral out of nothing. o there is nowhere to fall back to.</P>
<P>Of course it may be hasty to consider that useless, since it was all of the neutrals fall back to in the .NET Framework anyway. And of course one can always create a custom culture with a custom fallback if one wants to. :-)</P>
<P>I'll talk more about some of the thinking outside of the box that took place on alternate solutions (the "roads not taken")&nbsp;soon....</P>

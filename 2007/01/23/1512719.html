<P>Around the end of 2006, when I was explaining how <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/12/23/1351269.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/12/23/1351269.html">Vista turns on everything</A></STRONG>, and I explained about how you could no longer turn off advanced text services in Vista, developer Kyle sent me some email to correct me on this point:</P>

Even though it has been taken out of the user interface, you could still turn it off in your application with this shim, don't you think?</EM></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Well, I had some good news and bad news for Kyle....</P>
<P>The good news is that he was right; I had never heard of this shim by that name before (though I knew about the choice on the appcompat tab in the Shell properties dialog that is supported by this shim).</P>
<P>And the bad news is that the him was also removed in Vista, so even learning about it doesn't change anything; you still can't turn off Advanced Text Services in Vista....</P>
<P>Sorry Kyle! Vista is still an operating system you can't turn off!</P>

What is your default system locale, since this will affect the CP_OEMCP of the machine? </p>

<P>I probably have to stop going by Erik's office.</P>
<P>It doesn't matter what he wants to mention to me, but somehow it sucks me in every time -- whether it is a Brad Paisley video, an old story about IBM, a Barry Manilow song, or whatever. But he gets me every time.</P>
<P>I think he will be doing a guest blog post soon, so stay tuned. It will probably be technical though, so if you are a weekend reader you may not be as interested....</P>
<P>Anyway, today he pointed me <A class="" href="http://althouse.blogspot.com/" mce_href="http://althouse.blogspot.com/">Ann Althouse's blog</A>, specifically her Thursday post entitled <A class="" href="http://althouse.blogspot.com/2007/10/and-another-thing-crotch-down-where.html" mce_href="http://althouse.blogspot.com/2007/10/and-another-thing-crotch-down-where.html">"And another thing - the crotch, down where your nuts hang - is always a little too tight..."</A>, where they released all of the presidential phone conversation recordings.</P>
<P>Listen to the audio, too.</P>
<P>Something about hearing LBJ commenting about the pants he had received and what he wants in his next pair. TMI, big time!</P>
<P>Definitely something to file under FOTMI (the "Freedom Of Too Much Information" act)....</P>

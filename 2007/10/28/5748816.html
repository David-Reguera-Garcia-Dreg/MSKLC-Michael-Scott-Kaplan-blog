<P>I decided to say what the hell and pick up a new copy of Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) and went to upgrade&nbsp;my Mac&nbsp;earlier today (you know, the MacBook Pro I have <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/07/22/4005455.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/07/22/4005455.html"><STRONG>mentioned</STRONG></A> <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/07/27/4081784.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/07/27/4081784.html"><STRONG>before</STRONG></A>).</P>
<P>This was a scary thing to do, since I had no AC adapter (I accidentally left in San Jose after my last IUC 31 talk, after having previously left it twice during the conference and getting it back!).</P>
<P>So, armed with a battery with what I thought was only a 50% charge, and even with the setup warning me that I should plug in, I decided to throw caution to the wind.</P>
<P>Leaving the DVD aside for days and not installing it just seemed like a worse idea!</P>
<P>Of course as soon as the time had been calculated I decided I was in trouble -- it was saying the setup would take 2 hours and as it happens I had only 48% left on my battery.</P>
<P>"I'm screwed," I decided.</P>
<P>Luckily, Apple is just as bad as Microsoft is in this area (and Mac is better on battery life than Vista!)&nbsp;-- the time went down much faster than the battery power did, and setup was able to finish. :-)</P>
<P>I even had enough to boot into my 32-bit and 64-bit Vista Boot Camp partitions and install the updated drivers right off the Mac OS X 10.5 disk.</P>
<P>I barely had time to look at it yet, but 10.5 looked nice and spacey and 32-bit Vista seemed okay.</P>
<P>The 64-bit Vista looked good before the reboot but would not let me log back in after (the keyboard wouldn't recognize the DELETE key for the CTRL+ALT+DEL and it failed in with the soft keyboard as well -- I'll have to plug in a USB keyboard once I have a power cord again and try and figure out what is failing there).</P>
<P>But for the most part, it looks like the Tiger is now a Leopard and the spots have been upgraded! :-)</P>
<P><EM>I am sure I'll be blogging about this more once I have a power source again!</EM></P>

<P><EM><FONT color=#ff0000>This post originally was part of a very different blog which (thankfully) </FONT></EM><EM><FONT color=#ff0000>no longer exists and could be best described as a rawer version of SiaO -- a fledging blogger's first effort at transformation.&nbsp;</FONT></EM><EM><FONT color=#ff0000>It has been reposted here for essentially no good reason whatsoever.

<P>My latest task is to try and make myself more attractive to Canadian singer/songwriter Alanis Morissette. </P>
<P>It is not that I am undeniably attracted to her in a conventional sense (I have to admit that I am not).</P>
<P>And it is not that she falls under the "angry singer/songwriter" category that so many <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/02/05/367904.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/02/05/367904.html"><STRONG>believe I fancy</STRONG></A>.</P>
<P>To be completely honest, the principal appeal is that she has explicitly listed out what she is looking for from a man, and I think I can meet a lot of the "qualities that she prefers". </P>
<P>So often men wonder what women want, and (ignoring trite Gibson/Hunt comedies) so seldom do we get to find out -- it's quite amazing to have qualities listed explicitly this way. </P>
<P>The time savings alone makes this a worthwhile consideration!</P>
<P>The song (for those who do not memorize song lyrics such as I do) goes like this:</P>

<P>By my count (depending on how you number them), I have somewhere between 19 and 20 of these items (I say 20, a friend of mine says 19). And I have frankly been wavering on the capital punishment issue for a few years now and am very willing to be flexible here.</P>
<P>Now if you consider the fact that her engagement to&nbsp;Ryan Reynolds is over and then ignore the fact that the odds of her ever even talking to me are close enough to nil as to make a lottery win seem certain, I may have a shot, right? :-)</P>
<P>Well, actually, I don't. I recall an interview (sometime after the above&nbsp;was written) where she claimed that she actually had more like 673 things she was looking for, and that the actual list was updated after each relationship. So this idealized view of making relationships easier by having if not the needs at least the qualities that a woman might prefer is tragically not available, for her or anyone else.</P>
<P>Even that movie <STRONG>What Women Want</STRONG> is a superficial take on things that would have been better titled <STRONG>What Women Think</STRONG> since that what the premise actually provided. And while it succeeded in making Mel Gibson's character less of a prick, it still proved to ultimately be worse rather than better for relationships as a permanent gift. It was a t best a parlor trick that made seductionin one-night-stands&nbsp;easier.</P>
<P>What we learn is that even if a man could magically know what a woman was thinking it may provide nothing in the way of explaining what that woman might want. Because how often is anyone (mn or woman)&nbsp;literally thinking specifically about what they want in anything but the most superficial circcumstances?</P>
<P>I guess that means I'll have to&nbsp;sort it all out the hard way?</P>

<h1>'I was thinking of Lara from Dr. Zhivago....' she said; 'As I often am....' I responded.</h1>

<P><EM>Overheard at the 31st Internationalization and Unicode conference, nothing technical whatsoever....</EM></P>
<P>I had just met Laura, who works for ACT (the standardizing testing people). At the opening reception at Adobe.</P>
<P>Now I had taken the ACT years ago since I came from the midwest and all. I think I did well, if memory serves, though I doubt it matters now.</P>
<P>But it was fascinating hearing about their interests in Unicode.</P>
<P>Of course I was a bit disturbed about the number of people with names like Laura, Lara, Laurel, and so on.</P>
<P>Not all of those memories are perfect, either. My luck with Lauras and Laras has not been stellar in the past....</P>
<P>When all this was mentioned, the exchange in the title took place, with Laurel.</P>
<P>She smiled, as did I (though my smile was more wistful than hers, obviously!).</P>
<P>Later when I mentioned all this Lara/Dr. Zhivago reference to Stacy, her response was "who?"</P>
<P>Perhaps it should not have shocked me but it did....</P>
<P>Fuck I'm getting old.</P>
<P>Isn't Dr. Zhivago available on NetFlix? :-)</P>

<p>It prompted my to buy the DVD with the TV episode and make sure ewveryone I knew saw it....</p></div>

<p>I don't see anyone different when I look in the mirror (need new optics?), but when I see recent works of those actors I wonder, how come they have aged so much? &nbsp;Then I have to face who else has.</p>
<p>[This past summer I attended the 50th reunion of my high-school graduating class and it was startling to see all those older folks who sometimes vaguelly resembled someone I went to school with, some starting as far back as the same elementary school.[</p></div>

I felt my jaw drop and realized just how old I was ... or how young they were .... YIKERS!! &nbsp;BTW ... are there movies about SandM out now??</p></div>

<P>What's SandM?</P>
<P>Just kidding, I know what it is. Though I haven't sampled much of the field there.</P>
<P>Of course this wasn't about quotes (though I remember all of them; some people like it, some don't -- it averages out), this was about knowing the movie at all. :-)</P></div>

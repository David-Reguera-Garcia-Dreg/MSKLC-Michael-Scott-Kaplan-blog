<h1>CSI: Unicode?</h1>

<P>So I attended Tex Texin's <A class="" href="http://unicodeconference.org/program-d.htm#ses9_1" mce_href="http://unicodeconference.org/program-d.htm#ses9_1">How to be a CSI (Encoding Crime Scene Investigator)</A> and although I would have named it differently (preferring <STRONG>CSI: Unicode</STRONG> to go with the theme of the shows), I really did love the entire presentation.</P>
<P>It's description:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times">Join the CSI team, Grissom, Willows, Sidle, Stokes, et al. in the forensic analysis of character encoding crimes. This presentation will elaborate on the techniques of CSI forensic analysis and its application to debugging character encoding problems in software and web applications. Several example problems will be diagnosed.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>It is amazing how far he took the metaphor here, and how effectively he did it!</P>
<P>So much of my job has been working with people to try and fix those same encoding issues, and puting myself in the mindset of being like an investigator who knows that the witnesses lie ("my code is fine, it is IE that is broken here!") and so on is really fun to contemplate....</P>
<P>Hell, many of m blog posts have been about these problems, like <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/12/23/1354366.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/12/23/1354366.html"><STRONG>Do not adjust your browser, a.k.a. sometimes two wrongs DO make a right, a.k.a. dumb quotes</STRONG></A>&nbsp;and <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/03/21/399589.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/03/21/399589.html"><STRONG>Linguistic and Unicode considerations (or Language-specific Processing #4)</STRONG></A> and <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/06/04/616892.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/06/04/616892.html"><STRONG>What's the encoding, again?</STRONG></A> and <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/05/27/608351.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/05/27/608351.html"><STRONG>Consistent garbage text can be incorrect encoding identification (or detection)</STRONG></A>, and the list goes on!</P>
<P>Of course, I always preferred <STRONG>Crossing Jordan</STRONG> to the various CSI franchises, part of why it was so sad to see it go off the air.</P>
<P>Crossing Jordan just always seemed like more of&nbsp;a character-driven drama, much moreso than any of the CSIs....</P>
<P>On top of which,&nbsp;the image I will always have will be Jill Hennessy needing to bend like a GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA while her father has to look like a bunch of strangling smart quotes so they can re-enact the encodoing crime against characters!</P>

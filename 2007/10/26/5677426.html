<h1>Superstition: Why MSLU stopped using GetFileAttributesW in its platform detection</h1>

<P>I was reading Raymond's <A class="" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/10/23/5612082.aspx" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/10/23/5612082.aspx"><STRONG>Superstition: Why is GetFileAttributes the way old-timers test file existence?</STRONG></A> the other day and all I could think about was the fact that the way that <A class="" href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=14851" mce_href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=14851">Microsoft Layer for Unicode on Windows 95/98/Me Systems</A> (MSLU) had to drop its usage of this function!</P>
<P>You see, originally we used a GetFileAttributesW call to determine whether we were running on a 9x or an NT-based platform.&nbsp;</P>
<P>MSLU (in the loader)&nbsp;would pass it <FONT face="courier new,courier"><STRONG>L"???.???"</STRONG></FONT> as a filename, and then after the function failed (which it always did since the filename was invalid) we'd call GetLastError and look for either ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER on an NT-based platform or ERROR_CALL_NOT_IMPLEMENTED on a Win9x-based platform.</P>
<P>The method being used was actually recommended by several old-timers, interestingly enough. Raymond might even have been one of them though I honestly can't remember; several others definitely did. The theory was simple:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Available on every platform</LI>
<LI>No Unicode version on any 9x platform</LI>
<LI>Always a Unicode version on any NT platform</LI>
<LI>Function does its work very quickly and every oldtimer knew it</LI></UL>
<P>The first&nbsp;few releases of MSLU shipped with this code in its loader and in the DLL.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Then we got an interesting bug report from a product team that was using MSLU (I believe it was <A class="" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Picture_It%21" mce_href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Picture_It%21"><STRONG>Microsoft Picture It!</STRONG></A>) that was getting random failures trying to use MSLU, on some but not all machines -- <STRONG>NT only</STRONG>!</P>
<P>We had not been having any NT-based bug reports before since the library worked so hard to run as little code as possible on NT-based platforms, so I was understandably freaked by this turn of events....</P>
<P>It was quite difficult to get the repro set up, as no one could isolate when it happened and once I was vigorously looking into it, no one was seeing it anymore.</P>
<P>Finally, I&nbsp;found out that the close-to-headcheck for the filename being invalid was preceded by a closer-to-headcheck for the&nbsp;drive being invalid.</P>
<P>And it just so happens that <STRONG>Picture It!</STRONG> was often setting the CDROM drive to be the current drive, even though someone might remove the disk from the drive prior to any Unicode based functions being called.</P>
<P>And when this happened, the detection was failing and nothing good was happening after that.</P>
<P>We triaged it and looked all kinds of fixes (like always appending a valid path which seemed stupid to have to do for a file that was going to be invalid anyway or detecting the additional case as an NT-based platform&nbsp;and so on) before finally deciding to stop using GetFileAttributesW and finding another way to do the detection. We wanted to be running as little code as possible and adding any code in there was just not really something we wanted to do....</P>
<P>So much for GetFileAttributes being the fastest function, in my mind it will forever be associated with all the rest of the Win32 functions that do too much! :-)</P>

In fact since the 9x code path was known and fixed, it could have been written smarter to assume all other errors are NT-based. But it still meant the code paath was slower than it had to be, so we gave up and found a faster method (one that would not involve more code running!)....</p>

<p>(Actually, is the C: drive actually guaranteed to exist in both 9x and NT? &nbsp;I suspect so, but I don't know for sure. &nbsp;It's not guaranteed in ancient windows versions (1.0 at least, and possibly 3.1), as they can (in a pinch) run from a floppy disk only. &nbsp;But I don't think you can do that in 95 and newer anymore.)</p>

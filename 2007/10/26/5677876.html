<P>I saw Raymond Chen's <A class="" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/10/22/5586861.aspx" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/10/22/5586861.aspx">The best way to process Unicode input is to make somebody else do it</A> and I wholeheartedly second that motion.</P>
<P><EM>Wow, riffing on Raymond two posts in a row!</EM></P>
<P>And there are lots of reasons for it -- not just the things he talked about but also for random reasons like the problems that came up the next day in <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/10/23/5623838.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/10/23/5623838.html"><STRONG>If you would wait till I *FINISHED* what I was trying to say, you punk... (aka Premature validation)</STRONG></A> where eager Unicode character input processing to do validation did not take some of the fundamental issues with character input into account -- supplementary characters.</P>
<P>There are also the many issues that come up with complex scripts where it is quite easy for real problems to come up unless you leave that processing to the professionals and avoid doing character input processing in your own code, entirely.</P>
<P>Unless you happen to be writing your own edit or richedit control, in which case you have the job of learning and supporting these many scenarios, and I wish you luck (since you're going to need it!). :-)</P>
<P><EM>As an aside, I don't think that first letter in Raymond's IME table is the one he meant to use, but the one that as there and the one that probably he meant to go there are both co-sponsoring this post....</EM></P>

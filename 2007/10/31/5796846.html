<P>Even the most occasional reader of this blog probably has some notion of my love for <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/search.aspx?q=Limonata&amp;p=1" mce_href="../../../../search.aspx?q=Limonata&amp;p=1"><STRONG>San Pellegrino Limonata</STRONG></A>.</P>
<P>Anyway, after <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/05/13/2589142.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/05/13/2589142.html"><STRONG>Trader Joe's stopped carrying</STRONG></A> this vital substance (to me, less important than oxygen since I&nbsp;inhale but more important than water since I don't hydrate), I switch over to Larry's Market and once again enjoy those periodic trips to pick up my Limonata cases.</P>
<P>I have been getting 10 cases at a time, a nice easy number and large enough to work out some kind of deal for....</P>
<P>Then this last week U was running low so I called my contact over there. The conversation always starts the same way....</P>
<P>"Hello, is&nbsp;_________&nbsp;there?"</P>
<P>"One moment please." </P>
<P>{I am placed on hold}</P>
<P>"Hello?"</P>
<P>"This is Michael Kaplan, I was calling about getting an order of..."</P>
<P>She interrupts me and puts the word in herself: "Limonata!"</P>
<P>"You remembered! How sweet!"</P>
<P>"Like I'm going to forget this order?" {smile}</P>
<P>"How about 15 cases this time -- how soon would they be in?"</P>
<P>"Well, ordinarily it would come in on Monday. But we just put in our order and with the holidays starting to coming up I'm not supposed to put in a second order. So it would probably not be until Friday."</P>
<P>{pause}</P>
<P>"But let me see if I can get them&nbsp;it add it to the order. 15 cases, hopefully Monday but worst case Friday. I'll call you on Monday either way."</P>
<P>"Thanks, I really appreciate it."</P>
<P>"Any time!"</P>
<P>She was successful in getting it added, and so there would be&nbsp;no interruption in Limonata. But there was one problem....</P>
<P>The ordering changed a bit, and while ordering was done by the case, the price was by the six-pack (there are 4 six-packs to a case).</P>
<P>The order went through and she multiplied by 4 to get the price/quantity right, but that actually quadrupled the quantity.</P>
<P>So waiting for me was 60 cases.</P>
<P>Oops!</P>
<P><EM>Yes, I had a <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/11/03/488525.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/11/03/488525.html"><STRONG>Math is Hard</STRONG></A> moment.</EM> :-)</P>
<P>I had to admit to her that my car wouldn't fit that much. But I asked her whether if I bumped the order up to 25 could she make the deal any sweeter?</P>
<P>She laughed and said she'd what she could do.</P>
<P>So yesterday morning I drive to Larry's Market and enter the store.</P>
<P>&nbsp;I ask the cashier for the assistant manager.</P>
<P>"You're the Limonata guy?"</P>
<P>Heh. "Yeah, that's me."</P>
<P>"OK, I have the price here so I can ring you up, I'll call her so she can bring it to your car."</P>
<P>I ask whether she will have problems with too muck stock?</P>
<P>"Not at all, it's a fast seller even without your orders. By the time you're back I'll be order new cases to fill the order."</P>
<P>Whew, I definitely didn't want to cause any extra stress!</P>
<P>We manage to fill the backseat with 20 cases and the last five go in the front seat.</P>
<P>I drop those five off in the garage but leave the 20 in the back to deal with after work. I drive into work -- who the hell would steal cases of Limonata from my car! :-)</P>
<P>My neighbor at work pops by to mention he saw my car -- the license plate made him pretty sure but the backseat full of Limonata clinched it....</P>
<P>And when I get home I make five trips between the garage and the apartment, taking five cases each time. They are now stacked in the kitchen. I should probably take a picture of it....</P>

<h1>Living ain't wrong with an excised song (Cleveland rocks!)</h1>

<P>So I was telling somebody about how I had just been in Cleveland visting family and spending time with my nieces, he asked me about that theme song on The Drew Carey Show with the wierd lyrics like "living in sin with a safety pin".</P>
<P>The song is by Ian Hunter and is <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/09/29/5202528.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/09/29/5202528.html"><STRONG>perhaps a good&nbsp;example</STRONG></A> of how people use songs&nbsp;and don't care that the meaning of the song is hurt by the altered song.</P>
<P>I'll show you what I mean. Here are the lyrics to the theme song:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><EM><FONT face="times new roman,times">All this energy callin' me,<BR>Back where it comes from<BR>It's such a crude attitude,<BR>It's back where it belongs.<BR>All the little chicks with the crimson LIPS go<BR>Cleveland rocks! Cleveland rocks!<BR>Livin' in sin with a safety pin goin'<BR>Cleveland rocks! Cleveland rocks!<BR>Cleveland rocks! Cleveland rocks!<BR>Cleveland rocks! Cleveland rocks!<BR>Cleveland rocks! Cleveland rocks!<BR>Cleveland rocks!<BR>OHIO</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>And there we go.</P>
<P>But if you look at the original lyrics in the Ian Hunter song:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Now to explain a bit further, the phrase "<STRONG>living in sin with a safety pin</STRONG>" is a slang term meaning to have a child out of wedlock (cite <A class="" href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Living+in+sin+with+a+safety+pin" mce_href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Living+in+sin+with+a+safety+pin">here</A>). Something that makes quite a bit more sense in the context of the beginning of the second verse:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times"><EM>Momma knows, but she don't care. She's got her worries too.<BR>Seven kids, and a phony affair, and the rent is due.</EM></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>All&nbsp;lost in the contraction of the song's lyrics, and it is now slightly bereft of context and meaning....</P>
<P>But who cares? It's just a song, I suppose....</P>
<P>(Though a simple search will find lots of people asking about the meaning of that line which is quite out of place both before and after one understands the meaning!)</P>

The song was written by Ian Hunter, the former leader of Mott the Hoople, in 1977 as &quot;England Rocks&quot;, not &quot;Cleveland Rocks&quot;. It was re-recorded later as &quot;Cleveland Rocks&quot; to appeal to the US market. But the original &quot;England Rocks&quot; was written about the British punk rock explosion of 1977, whose adherants's main visual gimmick was to dress in clothes held together with safety pins, and sometimes to pierce themselves with safety pins. The phrase &quot;living in sin with a safety pin&quot; was meant by Hunter to refer to committing yourself to the punk lifestyle.</p></div>

<p>Absolutely, yes. But that's what Hunter was thinking when he originally wrote it, and I guess he liked the line enough to leave it in...</p></div>

<P>I am going to try doing my regular blog posting at a different time -- like nearer to 7am Redmond time than to the 12am Redmond time I usually do now. It should make the daily splog spam maintenance tasks less cumbersome.</P>
<P>And I'm also thinking about opening up the comments to longer than 90 days, though I have not committed to this for sure yet. The reason for this is that most of my traffic is from Google searches and obviously those aren't all from the fist ninety days by a long shot. I figure that if any comments are worth more posts then I can still do that, otherwise I can just handle it inline. Now if anyone has thoughts on this they should share them, as I haven't decided yet!</P>
<P>Oh, I may have a guest blog post or two coming soon. </P>
<P>And I'm going to try and bring my "to post about" list down to a more reasonable level so the posts may be coming a bit more often for a bit.</P>
<P>There were also some conversations about stack ranking I'll probably have to say a few words about at some point. I am still deciphering&nbsp;my thoughts&nbsp;at the moment though, so it may take a little time.</P>
<P>Okay, I cannot think of anything else, I'll leave now. Thank you for reading this episode of blog track maintenance....</P>

I don't feel it is worthy of suggestion box, since the topic was actually covered already; so this might help. Or you can open the comments for signed users only.</p>
<p>In either case, if you can't decide, just try it. If it turns bad, you can always close them again! :-) That's my little thought on this.</p>

<p>This is because I am looking for a certain article, and the Google search is way better for that than the blog search exposed on this page.</p></div>

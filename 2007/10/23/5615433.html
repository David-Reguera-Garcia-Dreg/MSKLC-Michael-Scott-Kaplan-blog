<P><EM><FONT color=#ff0000>This is one of those multiple sclerosis posts that you probably should just skip. Seriously, I mean it -- I'd skip it if I didn't have to stay and write it!</FONT></EM></P>
<P>Someone I know had gotten a link in the mail about&nbsp;multiple sclerosis&nbsp;and they sent it to me asking how I felt about it. This happens way too often, believe me.</P>
<P>The link is <A class="" href="http://blog.healthtalk.com/multiple-sclerosis/postcards/who-will-i-be/" mce_href="http://blog.healthtalk.com/multiple-sclerosis/postcards/who-will-i-be/">Who will I be?</A> and the picture is this one:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/postcard.png"></P>
<P>It's interesting, the post had been up for months with just three comments, then&nbsp;yesterday dozens of comments&nbsp;were added (I guess a lot of people are on the same mailing list as my friend?).</P>
<P>The picture seems a bit depressing to me, and definitely not how I think about MS.</P>
<P>About the whole multiple sclerosis thing....</P>
<P>I act like it doesn't bother me. But mostly it is only true since I don't think about it much. Even when I get mail with links like that.</P>
<P>When I do think about it, then I have to admit it bothers me some.</P>
<P>I'll show you what I mean....</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>That picture?&nbsp;It kind of pales compared to the comments -- there are some real hard stories there, and although I feel like I have been through a lot this kind of thing makes me realize I have somehow manged to avoid the worst of it.</P>
<P>Frankly, it's the reason I stopped going to MS Society meetings. </P>
<P>Because I hated feeling <STRONG>bad</STRONG> since I didn't feel <STRONG>worse</STRONG>, you know? </P>
<P>And I didn't feel like my <STRONG>bad</STRONG> stories were quite <STRONG>bad enough</STRONG>, and I certainly wasn't going to make stories up.</P>
<P>On the other hand, I have essentially changed careers six or seven times before settling where I ended up and most of those changes were avoiding MS symptoms that made it look like I'd&nbsp;end up&nbsp;on <A class="" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_Disability_Insurance" mce_href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_Disability_Insurance">SSDI</A> if I didn't change careers under the argument that I couldn't be gainfully employed....</P>
<P>Lots of&nbsp;people who have a harder time&nbsp;here, are&nbsp;people who couldn't find something else to do, or who&nbsp;never had the chance to&nbsp;do so?</P>
<P>They aren't that far away from me, I guess.&nbsp;There but for the grace of, yada yada yada.</P>
<P>I might just be in denial. </P>
<P>If I don't think I am in denial, have I proved my point that I and in denial by denying it?</P>
<P>If I had a dime for everyone I wanted to throw something heavy at after they watched the West Wing episodes where they talked about having to play chess with Jed Bartlett given the cognitive MS symptoms....</P>
<P>Made me want to rethink the wisdom of such a visible MS presence on television, when I was having to reassure people that they didn't have to start playing chess with me!</P>
<P>By the way, did you notice how many of the comments in that post with the picture talked about how God/god fit in here?</P>
<P>Well, I kind of covered how I feel about that in <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/06/30/653149.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/06/30/653149.html"><STRONG>Quando Dio vuole castigarci ci manda quello che desideriamo</STRONG></A>. I don't think that a divine presence has time for Holland's parking spaces or for my medical condition. This is all just life and what it brings to the mix.</P>
<P>Mildly on-topic, there was a Giving Campaign event in our building today -- a miniature golf tournament, spread throughout the building.</P>
<P>Really spread in all the hallways -- I barely made it my office and I wouldn't have made it if I had the big scooter today.</P>
<P>I left after the first time I had to go the bathroom -- being that boxed in is just very un-fun, and it's unfair to tell people they can't have a nice event that they are enjoying....</P>
<P>I'd worry about the fire hazard and trying to get out of the building, but in truth I'd be semi-screwed if I were on my own then anyway since I can't take the scooter down the elevator in an emergency and it's not like I can take on the stairs. This is why I stay home on fire drill days....</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Anyway, you see what happens when I start thinking about it. </P>
<P>You just witnessed a whole little thing that happened to me, right on the spot as I was writing the above.</P>
<P>And my outlook is much more hopeful than all that, really.</P>
<P>If you did read this post then I'm really sorry, it is kind of a waste, and just ends without any</P>

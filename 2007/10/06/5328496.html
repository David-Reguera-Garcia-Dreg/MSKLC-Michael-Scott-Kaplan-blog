<P>Fritz, in response to my <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/10/05/5295391.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/10/05/5295391.html"><STRONG>Making the THE silent, and at the same time not doing so, as the answer?</STRONG></A>, asked via the contact link what would be the effect of Mark Liberman's <A class="" href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004886.html" mce_href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004886.html">Naming Opportunities</A> over on Language Log.</P>
<P>Hmmm.</P>
<P>I admit I am under-equipped here, and not just because I am not a lawyer, and not just because I have seldom if ever found myself in direct contact with anyone named Fritz. :-)</P>
<P>But I think we're safe. It is not like they are doing anything special with the word <STRONG>THE</STRONG> if they are ignoring it indexes. In fact, I would make the claim that ignored <STRONG>the</STRONG> is either exempt from royalties or at least deserves a smaller royalty amount? :-)</P>
<P>But ignoring that issue, if on indexes only the sentence with the ignored THE, then the sort key would be at least three bytes smaller and maybe more -- over a huge dataset the reduced storage costs could at&nbsp; some point become significant (though if you follow the Glenda Browne suggestion and index it twice the storage costs would be higher)....</P>

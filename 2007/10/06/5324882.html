<h1>Work/life balance, step 1 -- take back the weelend!</h1>

<P>As a part of the whole work/life balance thing, I am going to try to not work so much over the weekend.</P>
<P>I mean, I am sure I'll think about language stuff and all that. But I am going to ty to put aside the work stuff as much as I can.</P>
<P>The blog consequence? Well, if you are here for technical topics then think of the weekend as a real wasteland, and if the non-technical topics are your cup of tea then most of the week for you will be like the Sahara Desert but perhaps with more water if you bring it with you.</P>
<P>We'll see how well this works out, but I have to do something to get a bit of "life" time back; I have been putting way too much into the job lately and I need to be able to do some of the other things that interest me outside of the job....</P>

<p>Your in-the-week technical posts are what I clip and mark for follow-up in my feed reader. &nbsp;I don't always have a picture of how the different pieces fit together, but I know they will and they will end up being about something important to me down the road.</p>
<p>The in-your-life stuff I tend to read all the way through and I smile a lot. &nbsp;That ads up to a lot of smiling (including all sources) on the weekend.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<P>The other day, in response to my post <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/10/09/5372681.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/10/09/5372681.html"><STRONG>It looks like you are using Google anyway</STRONG></A>, reader Michael <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/10/09/5372681.html#5391542" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/10/09/5372681.html#5391542">commented</A>:</P>

<P><EM>:-D not to mention that the builtin search tool doesn't provide $ to your adsense for search account! Which it should, I've just signed up for a blog at msdn yesterday and feeling my way around in the dark. &nbsp;We should be able to slightly monetise our blogs on msdn specially seeing as I'm a lowly Database Specialist on the Southern Tip of Africa of all places ;-). &nbsp;Great Article! (another ;-)) and I'm not ranting... would just be a nice to have.</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Well, I don't have such an account, and I'm not trying to offset expenses here or make any money....</P>
<P>I'm just trying to figure out to make this blog more searchable, lacking the skill and resources to accomplish the kind of thing <A class="" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing">Raymond</A> accomplishes with <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/01/06/1420754.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/01/06/1420754.html"><STRONG>his book</STRONG></A>, which was to provide a more ordered look at a medium that is by its very definition unordered and unstructured. :-)</P>
<P>This is a problem that gets worse by the day as there are so many posts here and that number can get in the way of the overall usefulness.</P>
<P>But the content here is free and I make no money off of ads or whatever. </P>
<P>Hopefully if you are reading this you are enjoying it (if not then you have to ask yourself why you're here, right?)....</P>
<P>So it isn't free as in beer or as in speech; this blog is free as in I'm not charging!</P>

<P>It was a real deja vu experience when Kevin pointed this one out to me:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times">From just released Microsoft security bulletin: <BR><BR></FONT><FONT face="times new roman,times"><EM>“…formerly known as Wang Image Viewer, handles specifically crafted images files…” <BR></EM><BR>Let me just say, it takes a certain naivety to call one’s software the Wang Image Viewer. </FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(The actual bulletin was <A class="" href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS07-055.mspx" mce_href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS07-055.mspx">MS07-55</A>.)</P>
<P>Weren't you just reminded of <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/07/26/679063.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/07/26/679063.html"><STRONG>The name of the enum is KeysEx, dammit</STRONG></A> just a little bit?</P>
<P>Well, never mind -- I wasn't either. This is a different problem....</P>
<P>It actually reminded me more of the issues from <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/11/19/494420.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/11/19/494420.html"><STRONG>Screw language; it's about the dialect, baby!</STRONG></A> where differences in meaning of sounds and words as they cross languages lead to amusing little stories....</P>
<P>Though I suppose you could blame all of these issues on the fact that geeks never tend to really understand many of the pragmatic meanings that underly their words.</P>
<P>From that point of view, it is much more like the KeysEx/KeySex and PenIsland/PenisLand problem than I was silling to give it credit for, with the other-language component added in for good measure!</P>

<h1>A less intelligent strain of blog spam</h1>

<P>I am under attack here by spam and by splogs (hundreds of messages a day almost none of which is getting through due to my comment settings but almost none of which is getting caught by the spam filters. :-(</P>
<P>They seem to be equal opportunity (looking at any post as a good target) though three in particular get the bulk of the lame traffic attempts:</P>
<UL>
<LI>The Suggestion Box</LI>
<LI><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/05/06/591174.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/05/06/591174.html"><STRONG>Getting the real (localized) name of the keyboard</STRONG></A> from May of 2006</LI>
<LI><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/12/30/508157.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/12/30/508157.html"><STRONG>More on cursor movement</STRONG></A> from December of 2005</LI></UL>
<P>Other than the Suggestion Box, which I guess is more widely seen with a link available from every page, I don't see much rel reason behind the focus in these posts. The attempts at spam are all over the map from porn to Viagra to artificial enhancements of various sorts for both sexes (or maybe the undecided of one sex), nothing really to do with the post topics.</P>
<P>They take two different forms, with&nbsp;a third&nbsp;formerly common one that I don't see much of these days:</P>
<UL>
<LI>A bunch of URLs to another site, or</LI>
<LI>A single word such as "Nice!" or "Sorry" or "Great!" or similar, with a link to their spam site, or</LI>
<LI>Text like "This is s great resource. Thanks for posting it!" or such, again with evil links.</LI></UL>
<P>Things may have picked up a it since I opened up comments longer than 90 days, but I am not quite ready to give up on that just yet....</P>
<P>Is it unreasonable to ask for a bit more intelligent targeting of the spam here? So it can at least claim some nominal sort of relevance? Am I reaching for the stars here?</P>
<P>I guess providing servics in Windows to improve the searching for relevant spam targets would be counter-producctive for users, on the whole. :-)</P>

<p>According to its stats readout, it claims to have eaten 23K spam comments so far, so.. it's definitely better than nothing :)</p>
<p>They do have an XML-RPC API, so I suppose it might conceivably be possible to implement it in asp.net, but given that blogs.msdn.com is a shared hosting thing, I guess that probably wouldn't go over well. &nbsp;Yet another reason why I prefer hosting stuff on my own hardware.</p></div>

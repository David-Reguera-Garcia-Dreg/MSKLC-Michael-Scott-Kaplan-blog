<P><EM>Kind of a meta-blog post....</EM></P>
<P>I have a friend who&nbsp;told me how she and her boyfriend, despite often being separated by travel, have at the very least talked by phone every day for over a year -- and they alternate who calls each time.</P>
<P>I was stunned -- I mean, how could anyone accomplish that? </P>
<P>Forget about the "we're in love" crap, the ins and outs of life alone will often get in the way. How could a daily call be so consistently never forgotten?</P>
<P>Then she told me their secret.</P>
<P>They have no set time for their daily call.</P>
<P>If it is getting late and designated <STRONG>callee</STRONG> of the day has not heard from the <STRONG>caller</STRONG>, the <STRONG>callee</STRONG> might call and wonder whether someone forgot to call....</P>
<P>And then the <STRONG>caller</STRONG> can deny this and say that of course they didn't -- they had to finish doing the thing they were doing first. They were of course going to call, just <STRONG>not yet</STRONG>....</P>
<P>How does this relate to the blog?</P>
<P>Well....</P>
<P>I do not have a PDA.</P>
<P>And my handwriting is awful enough that I don't carry around a paper and pen.</P>
<P>I do have a laptop (actually, several of them!) but opening them up in random places to take down notes is generally not practical.</P>
<P>The upshot of all this is that there are lots of times when I don't have a chance to write stuff down.</P>
<P>This should not matter because I tend to remember everything, right?</P>
<P>Well, no.</P>
<P>For whatever reason, when I think of ideas that might be become interesting blog posts, I remember probably less than a quarter of them by the time I in a position to record it so I won't forget it.</P>
<P>Conversations with people, I usually remember. But even conversations about blog posts I tend to forget what the idea was even if I remember that an idea was mentioned.</P>
<P>Now sometimes I remember some of them later, or the idea comes up again and I remember that it was already an idea.</P>
<P>And obviously there always seems to be something to write about, so the blog itself is not starving&nbsp;-- the beast is fed pretty regularly.</P>
<P>But from time to time someone will ask me if I wrote about that thing that came up in a conversation, and sometimes it is one of these "lost ideas."</P>
<P>And I say <STRONG>not yet</STRONG>, but it'll get there eventually....</P>
<P>So are my friend and her boyfriend lying when they say they didn't forget?</P>
<P>Am I?</P>
<P>I haven't decided yet for sure, but I am inclined to say no. </P>
<P>That tickler keeps you from forgetting, so the claim that the call would happen is true, in large part because of the unspoken "<STRONG>because&nbsp;I have you to keep me from forgetting</STRONG>" that the other person may not even know about is a real thing.</P>
<P>It is much more genuine than a situation that is a lie. Like&nbsp;the reflex response to the late phone call question "Did I wake you?" (you know, where you almost always say <STRONG>no, you didn't</STRONG> even when you obviously did).</P>
<P>We never thank people for reminding us, mainly because the delicate dance of the illusion of remembering demands of us that we do not. But we owe them our thanks....</P>
<P><EM>I don't mean to imply that I am in love with all my readers, or that they are in love with me. I just noticed the situational similarities!</EM></P>
<P>If you wonder whether you are yourself in that same category for me, the easiest way is to put in the Suggestion Box&nbsp;or in&nbsp;email, like via that Contact link. Because once it gets there, it won't ever be forgotten, until it is done. :-)</P>

<P>And no, I always say "F*ck YEAH you woke me up! It's 1am!" - people know not to ask me a question if they're afraid of the possible answers. I never understood the "No, you didn't" thing. Work keeps me locked in a cage away from the paying customers.</P></div>

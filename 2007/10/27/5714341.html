<h1>Keyboards gone wild, or maybe just French (aka CSI: Text Input)</h1>

<P>Mike's question, despite being disarmingly simple, went several days without anyone responding to it:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times"><EM>Periodically (2 or 3 times a day) if I click on the start icon/pearl and start to type something, my keyboard just goes wild....a regular one is transposing the Q and A keys:-<BR><BR></EM><FONT face=tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; aaaaaa&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;éééééézzzzddddqqqa<BR></FONT><BR><EM>I just typed </EM><FONT face=tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif>qqqqq111112222233333dddddaaaaq</FONT><EM> and the string above is what comes out.&nbsp; I get another one where the “m” key moves to the “;” key.<BR><BR>I’m running Vista Ultimate (6000) UK English on a ThinkPad T60 and this has just started happening fairly recently – no new s/w installs.&nbsp; Not a major problem but wondered if anyone had seen it?&nbsp; </EM></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>They always say that when you hear hoof beats, expect horses (not zebras)....</P>
<P>Sounds a little like <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/02/24/379466.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/02/24/379466.html"><STRONG>The keyboard does not do what I tell it to!</STRONG></A>, doesn't it?</P>
<P>So let's momentarily assume (given the consistency for the resultant characters from the keystrokes, that the keyboard has not gone wild. :-)</P>
<P>Well, maybe it has gone wild.</P>
<P>Are French people wild? :-)</P>
<P>Because the results that Mike is seeing look a lot like the French keyboard layout in Windows:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/frenchkbd.png"></P>
<P>and we'll just put the US English layout up too for kicks:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/uskbd.png"></P>
<P>Wow, every single altered keystroke he mentions is an exact match to the French layout!</P>
<P>So in this situation, going <STRONG>wild</STRONG> (or going <STRONG>French</STRONG> if you prefer) is likely due to a[n inadvertent] hitting of the keystrokes to switch the keyboard, and the fix is due to either [again inadvertently] hitting the keystrokes to switch the keyboard back or&nbsp;more likely&nbsp;switching focus to some other application which will see the layout switch back....</P>
<P>Another case solved by the keyboard spinoff of <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/10/17/5499362.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/10/17/5499362.html"><STRONG>CSI: Unicode</STRONG></A>, <STRONG>CSI: Text Input</STRONG>!</P>

So far I never had the need to use any other keyboard layout than the one that matches my keyboards; assuming that number of users who might install a language version which default keyboard layout (isn't that selectable during install anyway?) does not match the physical (or memorized/used/whatever) seems to be rather low - e.g. I never heard someone commenting in such a thread that she would have a hard time without the feature enabled by default.</p>
<p>Hm, somehow I have the feeling that the reason was mentioned on this very blog before, but with the amount of posts and the diversity of topics found on this very blog it might very well have been some between the lines hint...</p>

I guess I should use a VM to refresh my memories of the install process :]</p>

<P>And one can remove any keyboard from that list that one is not using, if course....</P></div>
<p><a id="5719493" href="#5719493">#</a> <strong>jmdesp</strong> on 27 Oct 2007 5:16 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>You know I just constantly meet this problem and I'm not convinced any of the explanation I see here is the right one.</p>
<p>I use a lot Alt-Tab to switch from one application to another, and very often the time find out I've just switch from the french to the english keyboard for no reason. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But I almost never use alt-shift-tab, I prefer to keep my open windows list short and cycle through it, &nbsp;so I don't believe that's the explanation. I'm convinced there must be something more than makes me switch.</p>
<p>One interesting thing is that when this happens I also often find myself in caps lock, despite the caps lock led being off.</p>
<p>By the way, configuring a machine so that pressing shift resets caps-lock (the french standard), and then using remote desktop to connect to another machine, sometimes gives very random behavior where pressing shift changes between caps-lock on or off in a non-predictable way. The only way to get back to a sensible behavior was to go back to the default of having to press cap-lock again to release it.</p></div>

<P>I have yet to find a time that the keyboard switching shortcut was not invoked, so I am going to have to remain skeptical on this one without a repro....</P></div>

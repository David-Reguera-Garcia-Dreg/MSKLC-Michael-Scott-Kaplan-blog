<P><EM>Yet&nbsp;another metablog post -- and this one even has linguistic&nbsp;delusions!</EM>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A good&nbsp;friend warned me the other day that some people might be afraid to talk to me, since they would fear me directly or indirectly quoting them here on my blog.</P>
<P>In honesty I don't know that I have seen as much of that (people who are worried about such things&nbsp;tend to tell me explicitly that "this is not for the blog" before they tell me things if they are worried.</P>
<P>Though I am keeping&nbsp;the issue&nbsp;in&nbsp;mind in case I am wrong (any responsible strategy always&nbsp;allows for the possibility of one's assumptions about the situation being completely wrong!).</P>
<P>With that said, I did see another phenomenon today.</P>
<P>I was scooting by Carolyn Parsons' office and stopped to say hello, and I asked how she was.</P>
<P>She paused for a moment, carefully considering how to answer.</P>
<P>Her eventual response after that pause was completely and utterly awesome:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=5>Somewhere between </FONT><A class="" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Vick" mce_href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Vick"><FONT size=5>Michael Vick</FONT></A><FONT size=5>'s dog and </FONT><A class="" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_Degeneres" mce_href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_Degeneres"><FONT size=5>Ellen DeGeneres</FONT></A><FONT size=5>' dog.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>I laughed, and immediately asked whether I could quote her on that.</P>
<P>Her reply: "Why do you think it took me a minute to come up with it?"</P>
<P>Now my first thought was about how this was a new spin on the idea of people who were afraid of being quoted -- the people who would (if they are perhaps going to be quoted) rather have it be a clever quote. :-)</P>
<P>This idea may not scale though, ultimately.</P>
<P>In this particular case, Carolyn's response was freaking brilliant, but of course&nbsp;delusional belief in&nbsp;the law of averages help assure us that not every one of them will be.</P>
<P>Could I be building up resentment in the long run with things that I wouldn't choose to blog (either <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/10/21/5578381.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/10/21/5578381.html"><STRONG>because I forgot</STRONG></A> or I couldn't think of a hook<FONT size=1><SUP>1</SUP>,</FONT> or I just didn't think it was as smart as the other person did, or whatever) and I would tend to fear the whole <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/06/28/433622.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/06/28/433622.html"><STRONG>You Wish</STRONG></A> factor:</P>

<P>Anyway, back to Carolyn's response (to which the above does not apply!).</P>
<P>It reminded me of the issues behind&nbsp;<A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/06/19/430591.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/06/19/430591.html"><STRONG>Star Trek with linguistic pretensions</STRONG></A>, After all, since I understood both references, it really was a case of a story being told by its story references!</P>
<P>So maybe I need to rethink the theory of that episode. As long as you have people with enough shared stories, perhaps they could speak in metaphor, after all....</P>

<P><EM>NOTE: In addition to the wonderful&nbsp;lesson in this post,&nbsp;please keep in mind the lesson from <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/02/20/1724946.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/02/20/1724946.html"><STRONG>Dumb quotes... or maybe they are just smart-ass quotes</STRONG></A> when you are applying the solution discussed below....</EM></P>
<P>The other day, Michel asked me via email:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><EM><FONT face="times new roman,times">Hi Michael,<BR><BR>Would you know how I can escape the "h" character in order to display it without being interpreted?<BR><BR>To get for instance a more natural "9 h 58" rather than electronic clock-like "09:58" for French?<BR><BR>This is the natural format .... for French content, but I find the time is used so frequently in software sentences that it is less shocking displayed as "Hhmm".<BR><BR>I could not find this information in the help. I tried backslashing it, to no avail.<BR><BR>Thanks,<BR>Michel.</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>I too had real problems trying to find the information in help or documentation or other resources. The question is not just how to handle the situation of ambiguous literals in a format string; even unambiguous literals are disallowed, as my attempt to add an "ABC " prefix to the long date format below:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/literal01.png" mce_src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/literal01.png"></P>
<P>The trick here is to always quote literals with single quotes, like this:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/literal02.png" mce_src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/literal02.png"></P>
<P>That was easy, right? You can then even see it show up in the user interface:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/literal03.png" mce_src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/literal03.png"></P>
<P>Looks like I should update my Defender signatures, now that I look a little closer at the tray, too. :-)</P>
<P>Okay, let's go back to Michel's original question and apply the same solution:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/literal04.png" mce_src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/literal04.png"></P>
<P>There we go. Just what the doctor ordered.</P>
<P>Note that this does not apply in the .NET Framework, which can run the following code with no problem, testing&nbsp;both ways:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT face="Consolas,Lucida Console,Courier New,Courier"><B>
<P>CultureInfo ci = new CultureInfo("en-US");<BR>DateTimeFormatInfo dtfi = ci.DateTimeFormat;<BR>dtfi.LongDatePattern = "'QQQQ' " + dtfi.LongDatePattern;<BR>Console.WriteLine(DateTime.Now.ToString("D", dtfi));<BR>dtfi.LongDatePattern = "RRRR " + dtfi.LongDatePattern;<BR>Console.WriteLine(DateTime.Now.ToString("D", dtfi));</P></B></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and it will return:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT face="Consolas,Lucida Console,Courier New,Courier"><B>
<P>QQQQ Monday, October 08, 2007<BR>RRRR&nbsp;QQQQ Monday, October 08, 2007&nbsp;</P></B></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Now for the record, the rule in unmanaged code is not always applicable, 100% of the time. Clearly there are no problems with the punctuation in the format string, for example.</P>
<P>And people running in managed code might think they don't need to bother with the quoting, but you never know when you will have a component that does a bit of unmanaged work as&nbsp;well, so the quotes that won't ever hurt and may save you from unintended failure.</P>
<P>So&nbsp;to be safe, it is always better to quote literals because you never know when the code that parses and/or validates the format string will (in managed or unmanaged environments)&nbsp;try to take your string at its word, a bit too literally!</P>

<P>I admit I'm not the biggest fan of the search built into the blog.</P>
<P>And if I am to believe the mail I get from the Contact link, not too many of you are, either. :-)</P>
<P>But my options are really pretty limited....</P>
<P>I could put in Google search, but that does seem a bit provocative, even for me. I actually have to meet and work with the search folks from time to time!</P>
<P>And I could put in Live Search, but due to a side effect of the way Community Server takes care of tag nesting, you know, like if you click on <STRONG>Collation/Casing</STRONG> you get this link:</P>
<P><A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/tags/Collation_2F00_Casing/default.aspx">http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/archive/tags/Collation_2F00_Casing/default.aspx</A></P>
<P>and then if inside that page you click in <STRONG>Int'l Programming</STRONG> you get this link:</P>
<P><A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/tags/Collation_2F00_Casing/Int_2700_l+Programming/default.aspx">http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/archive/tags/Collation_2F00_Casing/Int_2700_l+Programming/default.aspx</A></P>
<P>and then if inside that page you click on <STRONG>Unicode Lame List</STRONG>, you get this link:</P>
<P><A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/tags/Collation_2F00_Casing/Int_2700_l+Programming/Unicode+Lame+List/default.aspx">http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/archive/tags/Collation_2F00_Casing/Int_2700_l+Programming/Unicode+Lame+List/default.aspx</A></P>
<P>and so on. And of course all of the just about&nbsp;"equivalent" entries:</P>
<P><A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/tags/Unicode+Lame+List/Int_2700_l+Programming/Collation_2F00_Casing/default.aspx">http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/archive/tags/Unicode+Lame+List/Int_2700_l+Programming/Collation_2F00_Casing/default.aspx</A><BR><A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/tags/Unicode+Lame+List/Collation_2F00_Casing/Int_2700_l+Programming/default.aspx">http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/archive/tags/Unicode+Lame+List/Collation_2F00_Casing/Int_2700_l+Programming/default.aspx</A></P>
<P>You get the point, I'm sure.</P>
<P>All well and good, but any post that is in that last link is also in the preceding several.&nbsp;</P>
<P>And Live Search can through that nesting find the same page multiple times and not notice that it is not looking at the same page -- so even if you found what would have been the blog's equivalent of a Live Search <A class="" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googlewhack" mce_href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googlewhack">Googlewhack</A> then the fact that is under multiple columns will cause the same page to be found under every possible combination of the categories.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">So when I searched for content on a page, it was finding the same page over and over. </P>
<P>Not fully cool for built-in search. :-(</P>
<P>Though in the end I'll blame it in Community Server's tagging setup, and probably leave the built-in search alone.</P>
<P><EM>It&nbsp;appears that&nbsp;Google has a little of the same problem, though not nearly as bad.</EM></P>
<P>Though if the referrer stats are to believed, all&nbsp;53 of&nbsp;my readers who search are using <A class="" href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=&amp;hl=en&amp;newwindow=1&amp;num=100&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;lr=&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_nlo=&amp;as_nhi=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=blogs.msdn.com%2Fmichkap&amp;as_rights=&amp;safe=off" mce_href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=&amp;hl=en&amp;newwindow=1&amp;num=100&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;lr=&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_nlo=&amp;as_nhi=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=blogs.msdn.com%2Fmichkap&amp;as_rights=&amp;safe=off">Google's site search</A>&nbsp;anyway, whether it is built-in or not....</P>

<p>Well then, if they commented on you using Google, you would then have an opportunity to say &quot;if your search WORKED, I'd use it!&quot; and give 'em a well-deserved kick in the pants.</p>
<p>A little embarrassment might get the product manager to elevate the bug and put some programmer resources into it. Tons of people silently going &quot;ZOMG, why can't MS do searching right?&quot; rolling their eyes and clicking their Google bookmark won't.</p></div>

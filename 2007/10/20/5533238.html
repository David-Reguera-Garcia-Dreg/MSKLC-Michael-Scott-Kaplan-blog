<P>One of the great things about being able to spend time out in the world, with people,&nbsp;is getting the chance to hear things.</P>
<P>I tend to be a people watcher. too. </P>
<P>And with all that, you get to hear things from time to time, as well.</P>
<P>And sometimes the lines are very clever, even!</P>
<P mce_keep="true">Like when they are like from the Friends episode <STRONG>The One Where Ross Finds Out</STRONG>, where Ross discovers that Rachel likes him:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P mce_keep="true"><EM><FONT face="times new roman,times"><STRONG>ROSS</STRONG>: Rach, I got a message from you. Who's Michael?<BR><BR><STRONG>RACHEL</STRONG>: Oh my God. Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone Ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the...<BR><BR><STRONG>ROSS</STRONG>: You're over me?<BR><BR><STRONG>RACHEL</STRONG>: Ohh God.<BR><BR><STRONG>ROSS</STRONG>: Wha, you're uh, you're, you're over me?<BR><BR><STRONG>RACHEL</STRONG>: Ohh, ohh.<BR><BR><STRONG>ROSS</STRONG>: When, when were you, under me? Rach. Rachel do you, I mean, were you uh... What?</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The line I heard was better, I think. </P>
<P>Since as far as&nbsp;I could tell from my amateur eye it was not rehearsed or created by a staff of writers....</P>
<P>The overheard quote?</P>

<P mce_keep="true">I probably would have better served by having some more context (before and after these words) to be able to fully discern their meaning. I admit I was confused at first.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">Though my imagination&nbsp;readily filled in quite a bit of the backstory on&nbsp;this&nbsp;one....</P>
<P mce_keep="true">Know what I mean? :-)</P>
<P mce_keep="true">In linguistic terms, this would be the [fictional] pragmatic content to explain the semantic content.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">&nbsp;</P>

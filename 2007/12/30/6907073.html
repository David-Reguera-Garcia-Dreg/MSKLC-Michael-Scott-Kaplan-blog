<P>How many people think Michael should remember to log off of blogs.msdn.com from machines he lets his good friends use, even if they are running <FONT color=#999966>Panther</FONT><STRONG><FONT color=#ff0000><STRIKE>Leopard</STRIKE></FONT></STRONG>&nbsp; and have no access to secret Microsoft information? :-)</P>
<P>Assuming he keeps his word and doesn't check the blog this weekend, it will be days before he notices I even did this.</P>
<P>Shhhhhh! Don't anyone tell on me!</P>

<p>(Michael, I can't stop you from deleting this post or not approving this comment, but if you do -- you will make me think less of you. &nbsp;So there.)</p></div>

<p>Mike, what the hell were you thinking?</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>Let this be a lesson to everyone. &nbsp;No matter what MS does to increase security, no matter what any software does to protect you, sooner or later the user (read: YOU) must make certain that you follow procedure and protocols. &nbsp;At least rememeber to log off before you take off.</p>
<p>I wish I could be there when Raymond Chen, Larry Osterman, or Rico Mariani finds out about this.</p>
<p>Oh! &nbsp;Wait! &nbsp;You don't think it could be one of.....naaawwww!!</p>

Also, given the mention of &quot;Panther,&quot; I would guess that it's his laptop which this person is borrowing, not a &quot;work PC.&quot;</p>
<p>So, it's pretty funny, but no worse than somebody posting stuff to your facebook page while you let them borrow your computer (to the OP: I hope you checked that as well :p~)</p></div>

<p>I do agree with you, and this situation is pretty funny. &nbsp;However, I must say that my point remains. &nbsp;Remember, it didn't have to be a friend.</p>

<p>Considering this involves a website where any user can choose to remained logged in, using cookies, how does this have anything to do with Microsoft. Every web browser on the planet offers the same option.</p></div>

<p>I was only logged in to THIS site, so there is no weird NT security issue James.Anyone logged in to this site can get comments posted right away; others are moderated. </p>
<p>Anyway, I have to get back to stuff here, I will come back and explain further on Wednesday.</p></div>

<p>You're absolutely right. &nbsp;But cookies can be cleared out or chosen not to be saved. &nbsp;Or don't let anyone borrow that computer. &nbsp;For example, my laptop has access to vast swaths of protected healthcare information - much of it through a web browser with saved cookies. &nbsp;No one touches my laptop. &nbsp;No one.</p>
<p>Michael Kaplan,</p>
<p>I did not mention anything about a &quot;weird NT security issue.&quot; &nbsp;You will also find, as time moves on, that I am a staunch supporter of Microsoft. &nbsp;My point was that people need to remember to follow security protocols - regardless of how secure or good a system may be. &nbsp;My apologies for upsetting you and for perhaps carrying this case too far.</p>

<p>P.S. I know you put the same comment in both posts. I am not going to do that.</p></div>

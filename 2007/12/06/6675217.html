<P>So last night at 7:59pm I posted <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/12/05/6674157.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/12/05/6674157.html"><STRONG>A Strange and Sublime HASANT</STRONG></A> and a ways down the page I put in a nonexistent Bengali word, made by adding a HASANT (aka Virama, aka hôshonto) to an otherwise valid Bengali word whose final vowel is not there despite lacking a hasant....</P>
<P>You'll have to look at the page to see the word, for reasons that will hopefully be apparent shortly.</P>
<P>On the page I pointed out that Google could find no instances of the word, a word that is "sensible" by&nbsp;a naive&nbsp;understanding of&nbsp;Unicode "Virama model" rules, though not by the way native speakers would use their language.</P>
<P>And I joked that soon you'd be able to find one&nbsp;site --&nbsp;my blog post.</P>
<P>NINE MINUTES LATER, Google found my page.</P>
<P>FIFTY THREE MINUTES LATER Google found that awful sucky Noticas Externas&nbsp;splog site copy of my page (but only as one that was filtered by default and you had to click the "show all results" link to see it!).</P>
<P>Thus for 44 minutes, my blog had a <A class="" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googlewhack" mce_href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googlewhack">Googlewhack</A>! Or even longer if SPLOG sites don't count...</P>
<P>Well okay, not technically a Googlewhack since there was only one word involved.</P>
<P>But that is not the point of this post anyway. :-)</P>
<P>Because the word was so far into the post, most splog sites did not pick up the word....</P>
<P>In any case,&nbsp;nearly half&nbsp;a day later, Live Search had not yet found either page with that nonexistent word.</P>
<P>Now I like the new page for Live Search, and I do like the relevance stuff -- a lot. I like the new features and I like the future promise. There's nothing like knowing that Microsoft is spending money on research and technology in an area to make one feel like cool stuff will happen. I really do believe that.</P>
<P>But I think we&nbsp;may still be at the stage where Microsoft could&nbsp;perhaps still&nbsp;throw some serious hardware money at the problem to be spidering more often, finding stuff faster. :-)</P>
<P>Not to find my almost Googlewhack, obviously.</P>
<P>My search is a silly and unintentional symptom of a very real difference in the two search engines.</P>
<P>But to be able to find the latest info, up to the minute, maybe that is a very worthwhile feature for when you need it?</P>
<P>Now of course it is hardly the only feature -- I find myself using both engines these days for most searches, as they often have slightly different takes on results.</P>
<P>And to be honest, while this "up-to-the-minute" crap makes for a cool demo, I am not out to see Britney's latest over-exposure, so the vast majority of searches (that I want to do) don't really benefit from it.</P>
<P>I guess this post was all about the fact that I had an almost&nbsp;Googlewhack for 44 minutes last night if not for a silly two-word rule.</P>
<P>Are there non-Britney scenarios where the faster results really are that important? I honestly could not think of very many.</P>
<P>Sometimes I honestly wonder if Google's search strategy is not run by the same principles that cause middle-aged men to leave their wives, get&nbsp;hair pieces, and&nbsp;buy fast sports cars.</P>
<P>Or maybe they just want to track Britney "exposure" shots as soon as&nbsp;they happen, something that the news services are never as fast to cover as the seedier side of the web?</P>
<P>Just Kidding. Mostly. :-)</P>
<P>And I honestly don't mean to be so denigrating -- how credible is a Microsoft employee who thinks Google is a bit off? Even a Microsoft&nbsp;employee who is not afraid to slam Microsoft when it is deserved will be treated skeptically.</P>
<P>But when I think about what has to be behind those results, hardware-wise, I am staggered, and wonder what could be accomplished by taking a big chunk of that computing power and doing something more significant than that....</P>

<p>(Technically technically, the words in Googlewhacks have to be available in Google's spelling dictionary in order to count.)</p></div>
<p><strong>Dean Harding</strong> on 6 Dec 2007 4:53 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>I could've just been a fluke. I mean, maybe Google and Live Search crawl your site at the same rate, but Google just *happened* to crawl it a few minutes after you posted, and Live Search just *happened* to crawl it just *before* you posted.</p>
<p>One data point isn't enough to draw a conclusion :-)</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 6 Dec 2007 4:58 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><P>That would be pretty amazing coincidence -- Google picked three links within a few hours from two different sites (my home page and the specific blog page are the two), and Live Search still doesn't find any of them with that bogus word. I think there is a pattern here.</P>
<P>Note that I did not post at my usual time either -- so any process paying attention to that sort of thing would not have found it so soon either....</P></div>
<p><strong>Asztal</strong> on 7 Dec 2007 7:17 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Does perhaps your blog software send notifications to external entities when you post? I know mine sends a ping to pingomatic.com. Perhaps Google is getting a notification.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 7 Dec 2007 10:55 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Aha, it does! There are actually several that the site is set by default to send to automatically, though it can be overridden to send anywhere one chooses....</p>
<p>(It might be a fun experiment to turn that setting off on a post, and then turn it back on later -- to see how long it takes without the ping?).</p>
<p>I guess Live Search is not picking up such notifications....</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Geoffrey Coram</strong> on 10 Dec 2007 1:05 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>MSDN doesn't send notifications to Microsoft's own search engine? &nbsp;or LiveSearch isn't picking up notifications from MSDN? &nbsp;Right hand doesn't know what the left is doing.</p></div>
<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 10 Dec 2007 1:15 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Well, blogs.msdn.com is not exactly MSDN, though most search engines covering blogs these days do seem to be using ping servers as far as I can to determine. No idea whether Live Search is not or whether they are using different services (the latter is a genuine disconnect, the former is an architectural decision, so it remains to be seen whether this is genuinely a bug or not)....</p>
<p>Though my original point on the &quot;instant&quot; feature makes for a great demo though is really not the most crucial one for a blog that is not generally covering latest news and such.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Maurits [MSFT]</strong> on 11 Dec 2007 11:48 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Another possibility is that Google Search is digesting the blogs.msdn.com RSS feed, and Live Search isn't.</p>

<h1>In SQL Server, A-Z, A-z, a-Z, and a-z may not mean the same thing!</h1>

<P>Yesterday, I was blathering about how <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/12/05/6660685.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/12/05/6660685.html"><STRONG>In SQL Server, the distance between A and Z is wider than you might think</STRONG></A>.</P>
<P>So now let's add case sensitivity to the mix, which is&nbsp;a great way to find problems, as I pointed out in <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/10/30/897681.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/10/30/897681.html"><STRONG>If you are more sensitive, you'll pick up on more problems</STRONG></A> and <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/05/11/416293.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/05/11/416293.html"><STRONG>Case/kana/accent/width sensitive SQL Server, for testing</STRONG></A>.</P>
<P>In particular, it will help find the problems I am about to talk about. :-)</P>
<P>Now, we already know that you should avoid</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG><FONT face="Courier New">LIKE '[ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ]'</FONT></STRONG></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>like it is poison.</P>
<P>But let's say, on a case sensitive server, what do you think might be the difference between all of the following expressions?</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG><FONT face="Courier New">LIKE '[A-Z]'<BR><BR>LIKE '[a-z]'<BR><BR>LIKE '[A-z]'<BR><BR>LIKE '[a-Z]'</FONT></STRONG></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Now wait before you answer.</P>
<P>First you might want to read <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/11/13/492179.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/11/13/492179.html"><STRONG>Which comes first, 'a' or 'A' ?</STRONG></A> and <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/11/26/495072.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/11/26/495072.html"><STRONG>Technically it *is* a hungarian sort</STRONG></A>.</P>
<P>So, how confident are you feeling now about ranges?</P>
<P>And now would you create an expression that would not break when the collation underneath it changed? :-)</P>
<P>Damn. You know, this series was certainly heading toward the areas where good expressions were hard to find and/or unfindable, but I really was not trying to get close so fast. And we still have some distance to go!</P>

Basically it supports &quot;%&quot; for &quot;0 or more characters&quot;, &quot;_&quot; for exactly one character, and [] and [^] for in-range, not-in-range respectively.</p>
<p>To be honest, the number of possible uses for the LIKE operator is relatively small, and I tend to avoid it.</p>

<P>Now as I said in <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/12/02/6639141.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/12/02/6639141.html"><STRONG>Learning to spell in Bengali (when one doesn't know the language)</STRONG></A> -- admitting I said many different things in that post -- I wanted to get a copy of that book by Amit Chaudhuri.</P>
<P>It arrived yesterday (actually a collection of three of his novels entitled <STRONG>Freedom Song</STRONG>).</P>
<P>I have no idea why it seemed so important. I really don't.</P>
<P>But it did.</P>
<P>I jumped immediately&nbsp;into the first story (I had to read <STRONG>A Strange and Sublime Address</STRONG> first, you knew&nbsp;I did too, I'd wager).</P>
<P>I am blown away by beautiful language and&nbsp;sharp imagery. Of places, and people, and food, and more.</P>
<P>And&nbsp;a world that I admit I know nothing about. </P>
<P>Yet I find myself learning.</P>
<P>Because&nbsp;I am there, in Calcutta. </P>
<P>Visting when Sandeep, who is only ten, is.</P>
<P>Could I be ten, and there? It seems unfathomable.</P>
<P>By tonight I have finished the novel. </P>
<P>By the end of the book I find that&nbsp;I am so completely lost in the language that I worry how I will get back.</P>

<p>Bengali shares with most of the other modern Indo-Aryan languages a pervasive loss of final vowels. &nbsp;That being so, it's customary not to bother with a final virama, and the reader just has to know when there's still a final vowel (usually in a borrowing, particularly a borrowing from Sanskrit, where final vowels were still much in evidence) and when there is not.</p>
<p>The explanation of &quot;give&quot; and other words with &quot;-ve&quot; is that until about the 18th century &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot; were basically glyphic variants, and the rule was to pronounce a consonant if a vowel followed, and a vowel otherwise. &nbsp;So final silent &quot;-e&quot; (another case of loss of final vowels) was always retained after &quot;v&quot; whether the preceding vowel was long or short.</p>
<p>As for the &quot;o&quot; in &quot;love&quot;, that's from Middle English, where it was hard to read handwritten sequences like &quot;un&quot;, &quot;um&quot;, and &quot;uu&quot; (&quot;uv&quot;) because they were just runs of ups and downs (minims), so &quot;u&quot; was often changed to &quot;o&quot;, as in &quot;son&quot; (but not &quot;sun&quot;), &quot;come&quot;, &quot;love&quot;. &nbsp;This didn't affect the pronunciation at all, of course.</p></div>

It's used strictly to form conjunct consonants - which are far more common in Bengali than in other Indic languages. Apparently there's an ongoing fight between the modern and traditional linguists, where the modern linguists are trying to eliminate the conjunct consonant altogether in favor of your very own internal hasant. The traditionalists are bound to win this one, and if your poetic tendencies are indication, I'm sure you'll be one to agree.</p>
<p>About the ending hasant, Indic languages in general tend to not pronounce ending vowels and have no use for the hasant. Sadly, I can't find anything specifically about Bengali, though I've got my feelers out there on a few folks with better Bengali know how then I...</p></div>

Or is it believed to not be there at all by people who know the language well?</p>
<p>This of course doesn't prove either way how things should be done, but it would help elucidate why things are looked at a certain way (if Unicode is losing anywhere, it is much more in &quot;hearts and minds&quot; than technical merit, so how people feel becomes very important).</p></div>

<p>In other words: The writing is not 100% reflecting the pronunciation, and one has to know/learn how to pronounce written texts. The mechanism seems to be simple in Hindi: Don't pronounce the vowel if it can be done easily, else pronounce it. </p>
<p>The exact correspondence between sound and writing which Michael expected (and anyone learning any language would highly appreciate) seems to be there only in Sanskrit.</p>
<p>Completely off-topic here: Dear Michael, I've posted something about typing in Dutch and smart quotes, but I'm not sure if it &quot;took&quot; as I don't find it anywhere on this site. Should I post it again, and if so, how?</p></div>

Yes, I read that before: &quot;Start a new topic in the Suggestion Box,&quot; but I'm not sure where to find that... </p>
<p>Sorry to pollute your topics, although I must say that I find the &quot;sweet disorder&quot; on your site really sweet :)</p>
<p>Ah yes, my friend says that Bengali drops the end-vowel less often than Hindi. For example, shubha would be pronounced &quot;shubha&quot; in Bengali, but &quot;shub&quot; in Hindi. </p>
<p>&quot;bh&quot; can't be pronounced without a following vowel, so it becomes like &quot;b&quot; unless another word starting with a vowel follows it. </p>
<p>Just in case you're not familiar with the sounds in these languages: The Hindi &quot;a&quot; is rather colourless and sometimes it's impossible to say whether it is pronounced or not. The English word &quot;pot&quot; has some sound after the &quot;t&quot; which could be called a rudimentary vowel. That's what becomes of the ending &quot;a&quot; in Hindi all the time. </p>
<p>This is about where my knowledge ends. Someone please correct me, but I think that when such a word is followed by another word, the ending &quot;a&quot; comes back to life, so to say, and is either pronounced more fully -- if the second word starts with a consonant -- or else combines with the following vowel to form a &quot;sandhi&quot;. </p></div>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Two stories here are retellings--and quite personal interpretations--of episodes from the Hindi mythologies. <STRONG>An Infatuation</STRONG> is a retelling of an episode from the <EM>Ramayana</EM>, in which Lord Ram (often spelt Rama) is exiled to the forest for fourteen years because of a curse; he is accompanied by his brother Lakshman and his wife, Sita. Here, a rakkhoshi (the Bengali word for female rakkhosh, or rakshas in Hindi--a powerful demon), Surpanakha, falls in love with him and tries to seduce him. Ram plays along with her and then humiliates her, as the episode shows. She rushes to her brother Ravan, the king of demons, who will avenge her by abducting Ram's wife, Sita--thus setting in motion the main action of the <EM>Ramayana</EM>. <STRONG>The Wedding</STRONG> is a retelling of the story of Lord Shiv's (often spelt Shiva) wedding.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Note what he does here for both Ram--&gt;Rama and Shiv--&gt;Shiva, but not Sit--&gt;Sita. Which kind of drives home the issue and one of the challenges that is clearly by multiple reports much more common in Bengali than Hindi....</P></div>

(They're usually called &quot;short&quot; and &quot;long&quot;.)</p>
<p>The vowel that gets dropped is always a single &quot;a&quot;, never a double one -- it just has to much &quot;colour&quot; to be phased out that easily. And as feminine names often end in a double &quot;a&quot;, that one is not dropped.</p>
<p>So the problem boils down to the question why single a is written the same as double a.</p>
<p>The cause is probably twofold: </p>
<p>1. The established standard for Sanskrit transliteration in the West, IAST, has always been difficult to type. Even in Unicode, some of the necessary characters are in Latin Extended Additional -- from the name you can already see that they were not high on the priority list.</p>
<p>2. Indians don't bother to write the names accurately in English texts anyway, because they know it can't be done really: Those who know Hindi will pronounce them correctly whatever the writing, and those who don't know Hindi will not pronounce them correctly, again whatever the writing.</p>
<p>To make it complete, here's the IAST spelling of the names in Sanskrit:</p>
<p>Rāma, Śiva, Sītā.</p>
<p>Also noteworthy here (see how the author sometimes writes the ending a, sometimes doesn't): Śūrpaṇakhā, Lakshmana, Rāmāyaṇa/Rāmāyaṇam</p>
<p>In my post, I see little squares for the &quot;n + dot below&quot;. Hopefully the other specials are coming through as displayed. Maybe I'll add some ITrans spellings, just in case:</p>
<p>raama, shiva, siitaa, shuurpaNakhaa, lakShmana, raamaayaNa</p></div>

<P>My friend Liz was heading to Alaska&nbsp;on Sunday morning&nbsp;and she ended up with something of a layover in Seattle.</P>
<P><EM>I suspect she just missed </EM><EM>me, since </EM><EM>it seems like there are flights to various pieces of Alaska every 7.5 minutes, even&nbsp;on Sunday. :-)</EM></P>
<P><EM>But these days I'll take what I can get,&nbsp;what with me&nbsp;hemorrhaging friends </EM><EM>left and right to other parts of the country</EM><EM>!</EM> :-(</P>
<P>Anyway, she left the&nbsp;"secured" area and met me&nbsp;in the pre-secured area, and we chatted for a bit (she had a few hours, and what the hell else was&nbsp;I going to do on a Sunday morning that would be more interesting -- laundry?).</P>
<P>I&nbsp;told her that I could have met her at the gate if she wanted.</P>
<P>She interrupted to explain about all the TSA rules.</P>
<P>So then I explained how&nbsp;all you have to do is by a refundable ticket for that day, no penalty for refund or change. Then just get it refunded when you are ready to&nbsp;leave the airport. They look at you funny, but they still do it<FONT size=1><SUP>1,2,3</SUP></FONT>....</P>
<P>Anyway, among all of the other&nbsp;non-technical pieces of conversation (and we had hours of that, lots had happened since we last talked!), she was asking me about that <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/06/14/631016.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/06/14/631016.html"><STRONG>Behind 'How to break Windows Notepad'</STRONG></A> post, and I found out that some kinds of conversation might not be appropriate in aiports....</P>
<P>I was telling her about an interesting reverse&nbsp;question that had come up the other day&nbsp;where&nbsp;a file was Unicode (it was a log file) but it was being detected as being in the default system code page <STRONG>on some locales but not others</STRONG>.&nbsp;</P>
<P>She was thinking about that and asked "<STRONG>Would placement of&nbsp;a BOM impact things?</STRONG>" (she pronounced it <STRONG>bomb</STRONG> and neither of us really noticed since that is what we would have called it anyway).</P>
<P>So I said "<STRONG>Sure, you just put a BOM in front of the file and then detection is easy</STRONG>" and as I said it the person walking by who practically turned white cause us both to realize the downside of the pronunciation of <STRONG>BOM</STRONG> as <STRONG>bomb</STRONG> (which is what I did) or as <STRONG>BEE-OH-EM</STRONG> (since that would sound like an under-educated terrorist&nbsp; trying to be subtle).</P>
<P>We were suddenly both very embarrassed as we realized what we said, then we laughed, then we got really serious as we both&nbsp;realized we could easily be in a whole bunch of trouble.</P>
<P>Luckily, the person either didn't contact security or security decided we weren't a threat (since nobody came to talk to us), but both of us decided to move back to non-technical subjects and stay there. Things that sound like BOMBS come up a lot less often that way.</P>
<P><EM>Now that I think about it I haven't heard from her since seeing her off at the security checkpoint</EM><EM>, perhaps TSA <STRONG>did</STRONG> hassle her on the way back to&nbsp;board her flight. Sorry, Liz!</EM></P>
<P>Much more talk about the&nbsp;<STRONG>BOM</STRONG> in the airport, and we'd probably still be in jail right now....</P>
<P>Would have made a nice alternate post title, I think: <STRONG>Don't talk about placing the BOM while waiting for a flight</STRONG>.</P>
<P>Though this post probably shouldn't even count as a cautionary tale, since I doubt there are any normal people out there who would run into this problem. :-)</P>
<P mce_keep="true">&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT size=1>1 - She decided me saying this was <STRONG>not</STRONG> necessarily proof that I was insane.<BR>2 - On the other hand when I admitted I have done this a few times in the past, she decided <STRONG>it might be</STRONG>.<BR>3 - And when I admitted that I did it on at least one occasion to be at the gate for someone who was flying in to visit me, she decided that it&nbsp;<STRONG>was</STRONG>. :-)</FONT></P>

<P>In the movie <EM>Conspiracy Theory</EM>, Mel Gibson's character (Jerry) is programmed (Manchurian Candidate style) to buy a copy of J.D. Salinger's <STRONG>The Catch in the Rye</STRONG> any time he sees it. This allows him to be tracked by the people who are controlling his behavior....</P>
<P>Now I don't want to alarm anyone, but maybe the fact that for years I was buying a copy of v.1 of <A class="" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1556158408" mce_href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1556158408">Developing International Software for Windows 95 and Windows NT</A> every time I saw one available.</P>
<P>I swear to Bob here, people -- I have dozens of copies. I'll probably give copies to my mentees soon, I give them away all kinds of places (though I refuse to autograph them despite requests -- I had nothing to do with the first version of the book and the only way I have ever been willing to sign them is if I point out this fact in the note above my signature!).</P>
<P>Anyway, over the course of my life I have gone through&nbsp;tons of copies this way, I have dozens of them in my possession now, and in fact I just bought one of the copies that was listed on Amazon as I was writing this article.</P>
<P>I have no idea why I do this, and as far as I know I am not being controlled by some evil conspiracy to assassinate anyone.</P>
<P>But&nbsp;I wonder whether someone should warn&nbsp;Ms. Foster anyway, just in case I have been programmed to forget?</P>
<P>This of course leads to the bigger question of who would be using&nbsp;<A class="" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1556158408" mce_href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1556158408">Developing International Software for Windows 95 and Windows NT</A> v.1 to keep track of me, anyway.</P>
<P>I am of course not very effectively trained as a killer, with minimal verified or unverified slayings.</P>
<P>And the scooter would quite a sucky way to be discrete or subtle (plus the difficulty&nbsp;I have getting travel approved is almost&nbsp;certain to be&nbsp;a hindrance for targets outside of Western Washington!).</P>
<P>Not to mention it would be a tad shortsighted to pick an out-of-print book, isn't it? </P>
<P>If this a Microsoft employee, the poor staffing and planning factors of this operation should definitely be a point of conversation in the midyear.... :-)</P>

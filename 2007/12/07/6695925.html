<P>I'm usually not one to jump on trends -- in computers, in music, in anything really.</P>
<P>That's why I don't have an iPod, and why my Zune is the color least likely to ever be considered cool.</P>
<P>It also has a lot to do with what I write here.</P>
<P>At times I have had very experienced bloggers&nbsp;with a lot more traffic list this as one of the reasons that I don't have more traffic.</P>
<P>But to be honest that is by design. I maintain as lot of pride in the fact that I have more web views than RSS views -- more readers than subscribers. So I find if I annoy those bloggers then I am probably doing something right. :-)</P>
<P>Anyway, the net effect is that if I get into stuff that&nbsp;happens to&nbsp;popular,&nbsp;it is probably accidental.</P>
<P>And when someone at Microsoft mentions their cool technology on a blogging alias&nbsp;in case people want to blog about it, I usually yawn and move onto the next piece of email, without even bothering to read the whole thing.</P>
<P>Someone else will read it, I decide.</P>
<P>But then I was looking at one of those mails, which pointed at the available online book <STRONG>Mommy, Why is There a Server in the House</STRONG> (check it out <A class="" href="http://www.stayathomeserver.com/book.aspx" mce_href="http://www.stayathomeserver.com/book.aspx">here</A> if you are interested) and I knew I had to say something....</P>
<P>It's not like I have children or anything, but I was once a nanny and both before and after that a babysitter. And this one just resonated with me.</P>
<P>It&nbsp;is awesome. :-)</P>
<P>Even though my uncle doesn't smell like bark (or didn't the last time I was standing near him!).</P>
<P>My brother-in-law will read this at some point, and he's probably seen a zillion children's books over the last few years. I'm curious what he will think about the book....</P>
<P>And of course I am very curious whether the book will be translated into other languages -- that is something I'd love to see.</P>
<P>Though I admit I know nothing about whether and when such books are of the same style or entirely different styles in other markets. Would the book just need the strings translated? Or would it have to be a whole different kind of book, stylistically, to be properly localized for another market?</P>
<P>Any parents with experience here from other countries/languages want to weigh on what they think the book would look like if it were being <STRONG>properly</STRONG> constructed to resonate in another market that they know about?</P>

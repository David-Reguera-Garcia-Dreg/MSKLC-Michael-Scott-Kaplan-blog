<P><EM><FONT color=#ff0000>I was going to run the title by some people since it seems like it&nbsp;might be mildly offensive, though one of the side effects of my little Cerebus-esque<FONT size=1><SUP>1</SUP></FONT> vacation is that I couldn't bounce it off anyone. So if you are offended then I apologize as it seems that when cut off from people I lose my moral compass?</FONT></EM></P>
<P>Many people who are looking for shortcuts will often pick methods that usually work.</P>
<P>Of course that's just fine until suddenly the underlying principle behind <STRONG>usually</STRONG> kicks in, by which I mean that <STRONG>usually</STRONG> isn't <STRONG>always</STRONG>.</P>
<P>Like the way people see how the <A class="" href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/0dy7dwx3.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/0dy7dwx3.aspx">Name</A>s of&nbsp;<A class="" href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/system.globalization.cultureinfo.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/system.globalization.cultureinfo.aspx">CultureInfo</A>s seem to be supersets of the <A class="" href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/0dy7dwx3.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/0dy7dwx3.aspx">Name</A>s of the <A class="" href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/41tw0thz.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/41tw0thz.aspx">Parent</A>s.</P>
<P>So rather than creating objects to get the resource fallbacks, they use simple string parsing to get what they want.</P>
<P>But then guess what happens?</P>
<P>Well, let's just run some code and test the theory here:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face="consolas,lucida console,courier new,courier"><STRONG>using System;<BR>using System.Globalization<BR><BR>public class Test {<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public static void Main() {<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; foreach(CultureInfo ci in CultureInfo.GetCultures(CultureTypes.SpecificCultures)) {<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if(! ci.Name.StartsWith(ci.Parent.Name, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase)) {<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Console.WriteLine("'{0}' is hardly a subset of {1}.", ci.Parent.Name, ci.Name);<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<BR>}</STRONG></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P mce_keep="true">the output if you compile this code?</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P mce_keep="true"><FONT face="consolas,lucida console,courier new,courier"><STRONG>'zh-CHT' is hardly a subset of zh-TW.<BR>'no' is hardly a subset of nb-NO.<BR>'zh-CHS' is hardly a subset of zh-CN.<BR>'no' is hardly a subset of nn-NO.<BR>'zh-CHT' is hardly a subset of zh-HK.<BR>'zh-CHS' is hardly a subset of zh-SG.<BR>'zh-CHT' is hardly a subset of zh-MO.</STRONG></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P mce_keep="true">Alright, we'll leave those five Chinese entries alone, I talked about them enough already in <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/12/18/6775338.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/12/18/6775338.html"><STRONG>this</STRONG></A> blog. Though it is worth noting that even if the whole hant/hans things hadn't been screwed up, all five will still be problem since none of them were named with that hant/hans thing in there....</P>
<P mce_keep="true">But those other two entries -- <STRONG>nb-NO</STRONG> for <STRONG>Norwegian - Norway (Bokmål)</STRONG> and <STRONG>nn-NO</STRONG> for <STRONG>Norwegian - Norway (Nynorsk)</STRONG> -- unfortunately there's no way to fix this one up without completely splitting them and giving them different neutrals, since all varieties of the ISO-639 codes split them. </P>
<P mce_keep="true">And that would break compatibility with&nbsp;the fact that their LCID values both share the same PRIMARYLANGID&nbsp;(<STRONG>LANG_NORWEGIAN</STRONG>).</P>
<P mce_keep="true">Come to think of it, part of the Chinese problem (the one I said I wouldn't talk about but that keeps coming up!) is also due to the fact that all five LCID values share the same PRIMARYLANGID (<STRONG>LANG_CHINESE</STRONG>).</P>
<P mce_keep="true">So when you get down to it, I&nbsp;could actually get away from the obnoxious oblique "No Means NO" date rape reference in the title&nbsp;and just remind everyone how much <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/07/23/4021529.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/07/23/4021529.html"><STRONG>LCIDs suck</STRONG></A> and <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/08/20/4472890.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/08/20/4472890.html"><STRONG>LANGIDs suck more</STRONG></A>&nbsp;and make my point with a tad more political correctness.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">Too bad I'm to lazy to rewrite the post....</P>

<P>I have some vacation hours that I could end of forfeiting if I don't take them before the year ends.</P>
<P>Now&nbsp;between that and the holidays and the three days off that Julie gave us all anyway, I think it looks like I should be taking most of the rest of the year off.</P>
<P>So I think I am going to try doing that!</P>
<P>I will probably unplug/recharge some too -- I think I'm overdue for that. :-)</P>
<P>And I have several blog posts set to go up through the end of the year with spaces for me to fill non-technical stuff, so regular readers should see no interruption in service (the number&nbsp;of&nbsp;already-written blogs that I can't believe I decided to post is <STRONG>fewer than three</STRONG> so I suspect I'll still have a job when I get back!)...</P>
<P>If I don't comment on something right away, then you can just assume I ended up with no connectivity for all or part of the time, and the rest of the time I'll just be holed up at home with the ringer turned off....</P>

<P>After having been stuck at home all exacerbated for much of my end of the year vacation , I feel like I deserve a little time off.</P>
<P>So I am going to take it. :-)</P>
<P>I'll be visiting with&nbsp;an old friend&nbsp;and I'll be back in time for work next week.</P>
<P>I will not sit in front of any computer whatsoever,&nbsp;so if you don't have an account then our comments won't get through until I get back. Sorry 'bout that.</P>
<P>I put off the posts that were scheduled so you can all take a vacation from me, too.</P>
<P>Everyone have a very happy new year....</P>

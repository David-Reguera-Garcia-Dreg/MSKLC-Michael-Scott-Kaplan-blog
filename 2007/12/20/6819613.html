<P>I don't think my body is used to vacations.</P>
<P>It has been a few days now, and I just haven't been tired. It's not like I am doing much (just reading, watching movies, catching up on other people's blogs, browsing the web, etc.) but it just occurred to me that&nbsp;I haven't slept since Sunday night.</P>
<P>I honestly haven't been tired.</P>
<P>Very strange -- it isn't like insomnia (which I've had before so I know what it's like), and it's not like I used to sleep all that much anyway.</P>
<P>But for some strange reason, I just have been doing some kind of strange 24-hour thing.</P>
<P>Probably good I am on vacation, come to think of it -- since I am salary and not hourly, Microsoft would just get way too much benefit out of this without having to compensate me! :-)</P>
<P>Anyway, I'll figure it out.</P>
<P>But if I don't and you start seeing a ton of posts, you'll know why -- it's because I was up anyway....</P>

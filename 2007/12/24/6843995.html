<P>One of the lingering questions in many people's minds (now that they can't ask anymore why no useful samples exist!) is why there aren't more tools to help with this process.</P>
<P>Luckily, MVP Mihai Nita is not sitting around waiting for such tools to be built!</P>
<P>Take a look over on his site at <A class="" href="http://www.mihai-nita.net/article.php?artID=tounicode" mce_href="http://www.mihai-nita.net/article.php?artID=tounicode">ToUnicode â€“ Automating some of the steps of Unicode code conversion (Windows)</A>, for a tool that takes many of these steps and tries to automate them.</P>
<P>This strikes me as an effort that can only get better over time. and one that needs to keep on getting better as the need becomes greater and greater....</P>
<P>Now this does not let the people who ought to be doing more here off the hook, believe me. But the better the external efforts get, the more foolish the internal folks look for not doing more here. </P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#ff0000 size=4>And Visual Studio just got served!</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>Thanks Mihai -- I not only owe you a book, I now also owe you a beer! :-)</P>

<P>Now if you look over on the side of the blog, you will see an expandable group entitled Rebuilding MFC and the CRT with MSLU, with links under it for <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2004/12/06/276122.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2004/12/06/276122.html"><STRONG>MFC/CRT 6.0</STRONG></A>, <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2004/12/06/276123.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2004/12/06/276123.html"><STRONG>MFC/CRT 7.0</STRONG>,</A> <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2004/12/06/276124.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2004/12/06/276124.html"><STRONG>MFC/CRT 7.1</STRONG>,</A> and <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/10/07/478235.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/10/07/478235.html"><STRONG>MFC/CRT 8.0</STRONG></A>.</P>
<P>Now that Visual Studio 2008 (aka "Orcas") has now been released to manufacturing, people might consider it perfectly reasonable to be looking for the 9.0 instructions as well.</P>
<P>Helpful MVP Mike (the one behind all of the previous versions of the instructions, with help from Ted W.), sent me a piece of mail about this not too long ago, actually!</P>
<P>The mail read:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><EM><FONT face="times new roman,times">For a brief moment, I had a thought: maybe I should do a 9.0 version of these instructions<BR><BR></FONT></EM><A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/10/07/478235.html"><EM><FONT face="times new roman,times">http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/articles/478235.aspx</FONT></EM></A><BR><BR><EM><FONT face="times new roman,times">then I quickly remembered that 9.0 (Visual C++ 2008) doesn't even support Windows 9x.&nbsp;&nbsp; Something that doesn't even run on 9x under ANSI, should I try to get working under Unicode? No, methinks there is no demand for this one.&nbsp; Haha, oh well, it was fun while it lasted.&nbsp;</FONT></EM> </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>You know what? He's right.</P>
<P>Here is in fact a list of all of the related technologies that really no longer support Win9x:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Windows itself (<A class="" href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/support/endofsupport.mspx" mce_href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/support/endofsupport.mspx">ref</A>)</LI>
<LI>MSLU itself (<A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/07/11/662550.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/07/11/662550.html">ref</A>)</LI>
<LI>The 9.0 Visual C++ tools, including MFC and the CRT (<A class="" href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/bb531344.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/bb531344.aspx">ref</A>)</LI></UL>
<P>Given that it is not supported to put the tools on Win9x and that Win9x itself is no longer supported, building instructions for the 9.0 version does seem slightly unrealistic.</P>
<P>They did show the easiest way ti deqal with a request they did not want to have to work on (in this case integrating MSLU support into the CRT and MFC) -- when in doubt, just stall until the request no longer makes sense!</P>
<P>The plus side of all of this is that the need for non-Unicode support has been given a swift kick in the ass and it might be time to turn up the heat on better conversion of projects to Unicode in future versions of Visual Studio.... :-)</P>

<P><EM><FONT color=#ff0000>In memory of&nbsp;Allen Sherman....</FONT></EM>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A bit of track maintenance.</P>
<P>I did get some sleep last night -- so that <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/12/20/6819613.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/12/20/6819613.html"><STRONG>long streak of no sleep</STRONG></A> is officially over. It was not a ton of sleep, but my usual amount, at least.</P>
<P>In other news, regular reader and my window into LCA (Cindy) pointed out that doing web research on the sparrows' tears issues I discussed <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/12/18/6794321.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/12/18/6794321.html"><STRONG>recently</STRONG></A> are hampered by the fact that&nbsp;all of the splogs that republish&nbsp;my posts&nbsp;for their own gain are a tangible force on the web such that anything covered in a blog post seems to overshadow everything else not related to the post that could verify the facts therein.</P>
<P>Cindy does tend to hyperbole (!), but more than one or two splogs seems to end up in there. She kind of has a point.</P>
<P>Anyhow....</P>
<P>It is amazing how annoying&nbsp;it can be when&nbsp;one NT&nbsp;domain's time seems to be 1.5-2 minutes off all of the others, and also every other centralized time source I was able to check.</P>
<P>Especially when it is your domain that is off and any time you have to RAS in your time is helpfully "fixed" to that wrong time.</P>
<P>Reporting the issue to the helpdesk was a fun adventure too, but I don't know who to mail so I figure they can keep escalating until they can find <STRONG>Bob</STRONG> or <STRONG>Frank</STRONG> or <STRONG>Gilda</STRONG> or whoever can fix this. Maybe it's <STRONG>Chuck</STRONG>.</P>
<P>By the time I am back in the office working again, it may all be fixed now. I think its been off for a few weeks now if my ReplayTV/DVArchive logs are to be believed.</P>
<P>Moral of the story? Don't use RAS on vacation. :-)</P>
<P>What else is going on? Hmmm.....</P>
<P>You know hoe they say that whoever you spend New Year's Eve with is somehow symbolic of who you will be with in the new year?</P>
<P>It seems to work out the opposite way for me, and has for the last several years (maybe the last five? maybe a bit less) -- whoever I spend the holidays with is someone who will be gone before the year is over.</P>
<P>Thus far it has caused me to shy away from the invites to New Year's Eve parties, which maybe isn't the worst thing in the world. There isn't anyone in my life who a) I would hang out with socially who b) I'd want to not have in my life sometime before the upcoming year is over so this year I think I'll experiment with doing nothing for the new year.</P>
<P>I have told some people who had invited me that I thought I was busy -- if you are one of those people reading this (as I know at least one of them is!), then&nbsp;hopefully the fact that I lied to you is mitigated by the fact that I care enough about you that I don't want you to disappear from my life. :-)</P>
<P>Most of the TV shows I watch are almost out of new episodes. That is because of the strike and it is very unfortunate. I'll probably be annoyed enough to write about that soon. But not yet....</P>
<P>I'm still enjoying the vacation time, though might be having a bit of an exacerbation starting which would qualify as the essence of suckage. Hopefully it is just me being sick which will pass much sooner, and I have been around a sick person or two in the last few days so perhaps this will blow over with a minimal amount of bloodshed.</P>
<P>And I did exchange like half-dozen emails with <A class="" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/shawnste" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/shawnste">Shawn</A> last night about something related to Korean, which I didn't mind since it did not force me to RAS in to be useful in the conversation. It was like midnight and I hadn't worked at all the day so clearly he was working harder than me. :-)</P>
<P>Okay, that's all I can think of at the moment. I'll try and post something technically useful and interesting in a moment....</P>

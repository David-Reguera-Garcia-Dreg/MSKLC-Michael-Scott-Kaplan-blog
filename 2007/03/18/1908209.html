<P>So the question I got from a customer the other day was an interesting one:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times"><EM>Does Windows support the Iroha ordering Kana? I did not see an option for it.</EM></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Windows doesn't support it, no. Though maybe I should say a bit more about this, it being a blog and all....</P>
<P>The basis of the <A class="" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iroha" mce_href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iroha">Iroha</A> ordering is a poem, one that is a nearly perfect pangram<FONT size=1><SUP>1</SUP></FONT> for Kana. The poem goes like this:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=3>いろはにほへと<BR>ちりぬるを<BR>わかよたれそ<BR>つねならむ<BR>うゐのおくやま<BR>けふこえて<BR>あさきゆめみし<BR>ゑひもせす</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Now this is a common ordering that many Japanese students in Japan may have learned during their youth while learning the language, but it doesn't really get used much after that (the <A class="" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gojūon" mce_href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gojūon">Gojūon</A> ordering is favored).</P>
<P>In fact, after talking to some colleagues of mine who grew up in Japan the only real uses that came up were somewhat&nbsp;random, like the ones mentioned in that Wikipedia article I pointed to above:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Seat numbering in auditoriums/theaters (a good reason to learn the&nbsp;poem if you plan to live in Japan, huh?)</LI>
<LI>Go games in Japan which would have the letters at the top from right to left</LI>
<LI>The musical scale in Japanese (A B C D E F G becomes <STRONG>i ro ha ni ho he to</STRONG>)</LI>
<LI>A few&nbsp;other numbering/counting cases&nbsp;of particular items&nbsp;used in Japanese</LI></UL>
<P>So let's back up to the original question -- if it is used all of these places, then why is it not an alternate collation for Kana in Windows?</P>
<P>Well, first the&nbsp;simple reason -- it really hasn't been requested (or, if it has, the request has not made it here yet!). </P>
<P>Second is the fact that most of the cases where the ordering is used don't necessarily make sense in the context of an alphabetical ordering in a call to a function like <A class="" href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms647476.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms647476.aspx">CompareString</A>.</P>
<P>Which leads to the more complex reason, in the definition of what I meant by <STRONG>request</STRONG>.&nbsp;I mean with an actual scenario, a time when the ordering would make sense (and make sense morally&nbsp;and ethically!)&nbsp;to use (and of course I would not count masking it easier to cheat on primary school exams in Japan when students own Windows Mobile devices as an acceptable reason, due to ethical concerns!).</P>
<P>Now would such an ordering actually be useful in some scenarios? It is an interesting problem to contemplate (the person who asked did not give a specific reason but might well have had one in mind). Or would the results be confusing at this point to speakers of Japanese?</P>

<p>Also CSS technically allows iroha to be used for ordered lists instead of 1, I, or a. But I don't think there's a huge demand for that issue to be addressed before others.</p></div>

<p>After so many reports, I got tired with the same ordering system (1, 2, 3...) when submitting repo steps. Lately I switched to iroha order. Some of my colleges get a chuckle out of it.</p>
<p>We all learn it in grade school. However, few native speakers can repeat the poem in its entirety. Most people only know the first line (7 letters). A lot of people can not read ゐ or ゑ anymore.</p>
<p>Besides completeness and historical curiosity, I really doubt that there is any need or priority for Windows to support it. However, if you ever do decide to implement it, how about support for the older Ametsuchi ordering as well?</p></div>

<p>Yes, Ametsuchi was also used for ordering as well in old texts around the 9th and 10th centuries. It was later replaced by the Taini (old Tawini) system, which in turn was replaced by the Iroha system.</p>
<p>None of these systems are in any regular use anymore in Japan. Iroha lasted the longest with regular usage throughout the 19th century. Usage dramatically reduced in the early 20th century.</p></div>

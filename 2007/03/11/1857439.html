<P>So I wrote a post and set it to go live at 12:01 am (an hour before this one is set to go live), yet it went live at 11:01 pm the day before.</P>
<P>Even though the changeover time isn't supposed to be midnight.</P>
<P>And why? Well, the server is (I am told) on the East Coast of the United States, so they are well into the changeover. Even though they are translating to Pacific time on my posts since that is what my settings are.</P>
<P>Time zones are still hard, and <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/02/05/1606868.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/02/05/1606868.html"><STRONG>our software still doesn't get them</STRONG></A> most of the time. Of course in this scenario people disagree on what the behavior should be....</P>
<P>I can't wait to see which electronic devices are screwed up over the next few hours. I do have those ReplayTV units running Linux that are supposed to be patched now (<A class="" href="http://kb.replaytv.com/index.php?_m=knowledgebase&amp;_a=viewarticle&amp;kbarticleid=43" mce_href="http://kb.replaytv.com/index.php?_m=knowledgebase&amp;_a=viewarticle&amp;kbarticleid=43">manual install steps</A> required).</P>

That gives me, and the software I run, the least amount of surprise.</p>
<p>I know people who always run their machines on UTC for the very same reason.</p></div>

<p>Unless of course they are doing the same thing, in which case everything will work well. :-)</p>

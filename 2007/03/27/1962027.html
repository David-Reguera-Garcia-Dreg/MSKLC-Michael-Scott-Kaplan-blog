<P>Mandi asks:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT face="times new roman,times" size=2>
<P><EM>I pray to God you read this email. I cannot find a way to print out a sample of all of vista's font on my new HP computer that came with Vista pre installed. I know for windows xp was hard. If there is some way can you please forward it on to me or a link or anything? <BR><BR>Thank you </EM></P></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Probably no need to invoke deity when asking me a question, since I don't even belong on a pedestal, let alone in some holy place. :-)</P>
<P>Unfortunately, there is no good answer, assuming Mandi is looking for what I am thinking about here, though looking at <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/03/18/1909475.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/03/18/1909475.html">In Vista, jackdaws appear to be somewhat endangered</A></STRONG>&nbsp;and <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/03/20/1917602.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/03/20/1917602.html">The lazy yet foxy jackdaw I love jumped over my quick brown sphinx dog of quartz</A></STRONG>, I think the mechanism for how to answer this different but related question is clearer.</P>
<P>The need is to get a representative sample of each font, whether that sample goes to the Windows Font Viewer or a sample of some or all of the fonts side by side.</P>
<P>Now&nbsp;one can imagine building in all kinds of mechanisms to automate the process (and I have been, both similar to and different from the one Dean Harding <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/03/18/1909475.html#1909936" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/03/18/1909475.html#1909936">suggested</A>). </P>
<P>I am not swayed much at the argument (sent to me by several) that text should be added to each font, provided by the font foundry. Because I doubt this would capture each possible target language that a user might prefer to see, if they have a preferred language within a script.</P>
<P>So here is my working model for the ideal plan (assuming no limitations on time, resources, knowledge, or authority!) per font:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Determine the supported Unicode script ranges in the font to try to determine the primary script(s) for which the font was designed;</LI>
<LI>Determine the user interface language of the person looking for the sample;</LI>
<LI>When #1 and #2 intersect, use that language and pick a stock sentence in that language;</LI>
<LI>When #1 and #2 do not intersect, use a default language representative for the script and pick a stock sentence in that language;</LI></OL>
<P>I was tempted to add an item to "allow the user to specify their own string if they would like" but since they can do that now, it seems less important....</P>
<P>Of course item #1 is the only one that is really complicated (the task of collecting a large number of non-offensive stock sentences, one per language might be time-consuming but it is a much more tractable problem!). Determining the primary script(s) of a font&nbsp;is complicated by many factors:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Many fonts will contain a basic set of characters unrelated to their target like all of the basic Latins;</LI>
<LI>Many of the fonts in Vista (for example) contain the bulk of the Latin/Cyrillic/Greek in Unicode;</LI>
<LI>Some fonts are meant to be more generic and contain huge subsets of Unicode as that is their goal.</LI></UL>
<P>And of course #4 has as whole land-mine of opportunities to offend people by the choice of "default language" any time a script supports more than one language; perhaps when #4 is being used a random choice is most appropriate? :-)&nbsp;</P>
<P>But I don't think it is an impossible problem to solve, though I am sorry that we have nothing built-in right now to do it. Sorry for Mandi's sake too, since the question there is similar in spirit to the question trying to be answered here....</P>

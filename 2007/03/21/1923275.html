<h1>Somewhat irreverent theories on the origins of the alphabet</h1>

<P>A friend of mine got me the new-ish&nbsp;3-disc collection from the comedian Gallagher.</P>
<P>In Melon Crazy,&nbsp;at 6:48&nbsp;into the show, he points out that we "...park in a driveway and drive in a parkway".</P>
<P>Like I said <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/05/08/415539.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/05/08/415539.html">before</A></STRONG>. :-)</P>
<P>Now Melon Crazy dates back to 1984, so maybe Steven Wright said it first&nbsp;or maybe not&nbsp;(not sure when&nbsp;Steven first said it, and none of the web sites that list the quote bother to say where it is from -- I hate unattributed quotes sometimes, it encourages the logic that attributes <STRONG>Elmo's Got a Gun</STRONG> to Weird Al Yankovic).</P>
<P>Linguistic&nbsp;highlights&nbsp;include his&nbsp;theories about the origins of the alphabet (from Over Your Head)&nbsp;-- "...based on some kind of a bookkeeper's code to keep the Jews' and the Egyptians' nose out of the Phoenician cattle business".</P>
<P>Or in another show&nbsp;when he talked about the order and why it started with ΑΒΓΔ -- "ah beh gu dae -- have a good&nbsp;day!"</P>
<P>Very silly, but definitely fun....</P>
<P>So, anyone know when (well, what show)&nbsp;Steven Wright first made the driveway/parkway observation? I know now that I wasn't crazy (or if I am then it is for other stuff, not for this), now I am just curious who said it first....</P>

<p>Hey, what do you expect from a culture that *drives* on *parkways* and *parks* on *driveways*?</p>

<p>There are also plenty of websites that attribute the driveway/parkway thing to George Carlin, but for some reason *everything* gets attributed to George Carlin eventually.</p>

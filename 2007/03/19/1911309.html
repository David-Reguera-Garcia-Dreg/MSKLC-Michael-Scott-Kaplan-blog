<P>So this last week Cathy had her 40th birthday....</P>
<P>Julie had sent a mail explaining in simple terms why it was so important that something be done for this important event:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><EM>First, we need to celebrate this fine milestone in her life.<BR><BR>Second, it’s payback time.&nbsp;:-)</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In keeping with Cathy's <STRONG>Inner Monica™</STRONG>, one of the important tasks was to cover the inside her office with a reported <STRONG>5000 </STRONG><A class="" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-It_Note" mce_href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-It_Note"><STRONG>Post-it notes</STRONG></A><STRONG>&nbsp;of all different colors</STRONG>. it made for quite a sight all week, let me tell you!</P>
<P><IMG height=676 src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/40th.png" width=507></P>
<P>That morning as people were coming by to admire and/or gawk at this fine effort, Jenny and I were outside Cathy's office discussing why this was so amusing. I pointed out that there were way more than 5000 Post-it notes there even if only 5000 were put up for the 40th birthday <FONT color=#999999><STRIKE>assault</STRIKE></FONT>celebration, given how many that Cathy always put up on her monitor and her desk to keep track of important items/issues.</P>
<P>Jenny pointed how all of those Post-its were very well hidden, in plain sight. Like that story, the name of which she couldn't recall at that moment.</P>
<P>I immediately realized what she was referring to,&nbsp;named the story,&nbsp;and I think both of us were probably way too amused at how many important issues in Cathy's work life were basically hidden by <A class="" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Purloined_Letter" mce_href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Purloined_Letter">the&nbsp;Purloined Post-it</A> method. :-)</P>
<P>I realize there are probably more pictures I could post, right down to the one of a 10-year-old Cathy with identical hair color, but she is probably embarrassed enough at the Friends reference above so I'll show some mercy....</P>

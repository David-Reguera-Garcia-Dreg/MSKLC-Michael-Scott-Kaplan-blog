<P><EM>(Don't these 'Every character has a story' posts remind you of a Colbert-esque </EM><A class="" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Better_Know_A_District" mce_href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Better_Know_A_District"><EM>Better Know a District</EM></A><EM>&nbsp;series? Maybe I should rename the series to <STRONG>Better Know a Character</STRONG>. What does everyone think?)</EM></P>
<P>Just recently, John asked:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><EM><FONT face="times new roman,times">Just a quick question I can't seem to find an answer for: what is the purpose and actual utility of the International Monetary Symbol? (ALT-0164)<BR><BR>I have never seen it in use (except as a non printable character used as an end-of-cell marker) but I have been asked if it could/should be used in some of our applications.&nbsp;</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Although it is true that in <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/tags/Every+Character+Has+a+Story/default.aspx" mce_href="../../../../archive/tags/Every+Character+Has+a+Story/default.aspx"><STRONG>Unicode Every Character has a Story</STRONG></A>, there are some characters encoded in Unicode whose story eludes us.</P>
<P>It is easy to look at ¤ (<A class="" href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/00a4" mce_href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/00a4">U+00a4</A>, a.k.a. CURRENCY SIGN) and assume it must have a hell of a story.</P>
<P>People in the wide wide world on the whole don't recognize it, and it isn't actually a currency sign in any country in the world, nor has it ever been.</P>
<P>Unicode does give it a general category of <A class="" href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/category/Sc/index.htm" mce_href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/category/Sc/index.htm">Sc</A> (Symbol, Currency), and it does have a place not only in Unicode but 0xA4 in <A class="" href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/reference/sbcs/1252.mspx" mce_href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/reference/sbcs/1252.mspx">Windows Code Page 1252</A> and 0xCF in&nbsp;<A class="" href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/reference/oem/850.mspx" mce_href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/reference/oem/850.mspx">OEM Code page 850</A> and 0xA4 in <A class="" href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/reference/iso/28591.mspx" mce_href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/reference/iso/28591.mspx">ISO-8859-1</A>.</P>
<P>Everywhere you look, there's&nbsp;this currency sign, one that is used for no currency.</P>
<P>I even tried asking Ken Whistler, who had no conclusive thoughts to add:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><EM>Michael,<BR><BR>Nothing more than my guesses. It predates my involvement, since it is an ISO 8859-1 thing, whence it got into Unicode.<BR><BR>And 8859-1 got it from IBM, perhaps. It is:<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SC010000 International Currency Symbol<BR><BR>in the old IBM Graphic Character Identification System.<BR><BR>Maybe some old hand at IBM would know what it was originally intended for.<BR><BR>I'm gonna guess that it was intended as a placeholder character for EBCDIC code pages, to enable formatting of currency that had symbols not otherwise representable on the code page.<BR>In other words, as a *replacement* currency symbol for a missing currency symbol.<BR><BR>But that's just a guess, absent information from the horse's mouth.</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>A few more discrete inquiries long the lines Ken suggested also&nbsp;yielded nothing, though I did verify that <STRONG>IBM Graphic Character Identification System</STRONG> connection. </P>
<P>It is funny that when space was at such a premium in ISO 8859-1 that they would use up a slot for a character that isn't really used for anything. Though it does seem to be in every font and it is not used for anything else (maybe that is why it is used in Word as an end of cell marker in tables:</P>
<P><IMG height=443 src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/CurrencySign.png" width=685></P>
<P>Weird, huh?</P>
<P>To answer John's question, in my opinion, why <EM>not</EM> use it? It has nothing better to contribute, so have fun! :-)</P>
<P>Maybe somebody out there knows for sure what IBM's original plans were for it. Plans so important that <A class="" href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/reference/iso/28591.mspx" mce_href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/reference/iso/28591.mspx">ISO 8859-1</A>, which managed to miss out on an uppercase version of a letter (a character story for another day, one that I actually <EM>do</EM> know!), had to include it.</P>
<P>Because every character has a story, even if&nbsp;we don't know what it really is....</P>

The various national character sets were based on ASCII, but since ASCII contains the dollar sign, and for several countries having a symbol devoted to the currency of the USA, and not for their own national currency (perhaps becuase there was none), was politically sensitive. Thus the character was replaced by a generic &quot;currency symbol&quot; that should not offend anyone in the International Reference Version (IRV) of ASCII.</p>
<p>I remember programming in BASIC on an old Swedish Luxor ABC 80 machine. It has the Swedish 7-bit character set (ISO 646-11), so instead of using &quot;A$&quot; for strings, one would use &quot;A&#164;&quot;, which when read out load would be &quot;A-sun&quot; instead of &quot;A-dollar&quot;.</p>
<p>According to <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_646">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_646</a> it is &quot;$&quot; in some national versions, while others have &quot;&#164;&quot;. I can't find any that actually replaced it with their own country's symbol.</p></div>

It was encoded 0x24 (in place of $), used primarily to denote string variables in BASIC, and called colloquially “rouble”, “cockroach” or “sun”, although the rouble does not actually have a currency symbol.</p>

<p><a id="1886512" href="#1886512">#</a> <strong>Paul</strong> on 15 Mar 2007 7:12 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Didn't the 'regional settings' control panel widget used to use this symbol to show how you wanted currency formatted? Like:</p>
<p>Currency: [&#164;1,234.56]</p>
<p>with a value in the drop-down to change to &quot;1,234.56&#164;&quot;?</p>
<p>On my install of XP it actually uses the appropriate symbol for the region, but I'm sure I remember a previous version (Windows 95?) using that symbol for this purpose.</p>
<p>Or maybe I imagined that.</p></div>
<p><a id="1887259" href="#1887259">#</a> <strong>Szajd</strong> on 15 Mar 2007 9:34 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Yeah, Paul is right, in the older versions of Windows the sign was used there as such. There was even a one-line legend label, something like &quot;&#164; = Currency sign&quot;.</p>
<p>And also, in the regional settings of Windows Mobile 2003 Second Edition, it is used as such. (So in the settings you don't see the live active currency symbol, just this universal thingy.</p></div>

If I remember correctly, it was used as &quot;disregard the previous character&quot;, kind like our backspace, only it was printed normally (since these machines couldn't &quot;delete&quot; anything they already printed on paper).</p>
<p>It's mentioned in a &quot;note&quot; as &quot;character similar to asterisk&quot; here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.wps.com/projects/codes/index.html#BAUDOT">http://www.wps.com/projects/codes/index.html#BAUDOT</a></p></div>
<p><strong>Van</strong> on 26 Nov 2010 3:10 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>My understanding was that it was intended as a placeholder for a local currency symbol that could be added by font hack.

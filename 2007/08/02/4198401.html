<h1>What script is that?</h1>

<P>After I read <A class="" href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004758.html" mce_href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004758.html">Exotic-Looking Typefaces</A> over on Language Log the other day, as well as the various posts it linked to, I was reminded of an incident from a few years ago.</P>
<P>You see, although I have lots of Microsoft shirts, for the most part I never wear them, instead I usually wear shirts from various singer/songwriter types (either ones I bought or ones that I was just given).</P>
<P>I was wearing one of those shirts, it had this pattern on it:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/Honeydogs.png"></P>
<P>Peter Constable was starring at the pattern, trying to figure out what bizarre script it might be.</P>
<P>"What script is that?" he asked me, the doubt clear in his voice. He couldn't make out familiar letters and they were all disconnected, he just couldn't place the text.</P>
<P>"Um, Latin?" I answered, acting confused at his confusion.</P>
<P>The shirt came from <A class="" href="http://www.honeydogs.com/" mce_href="http://www.honeydogs.com/">The Honeydogs</A>, who opened for <A class="" href="http://www.aimeemann.com/" mce_href="http://www.aimeemann.com/">Aimee Mann</A> a few years back.&nbsp;I think Adam and Noah would be surprised to have the band name mistaken for anything complex. :-)</P>

<P>I already have a job at Microsoft and these days I am seldom finding myself in other countries, but if I were interested in being at Microsoft and I didn't live here, I know that&nbsp;I'd love to know who the good contacts might be....</P>
<P>In that spirit, I thought a quick nod to some of the international recruiters at Microsoft&nbsp;for my readers who might be thinking about Microsoft and may even run across one of them some day....</P>
<P>They introduced themselves over on <A class="" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jobsblog/" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jobsblog/">JobsBlog</A> here in the post <A class="" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jobsblog/archive/2007/08/09/meet-microsoft-s-international-recruiters.aspx" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jobsblog/archive/2007/08/09/meet-microsoft-s-international-recruiters.aspx">Meet Microsoft's International Recruiters</A>.</P>
<P>Be sure to tell 'em I sent you! :-)</P>

<p>The campuses were all deserted. Hilarious if Microsoft hadn't paid for their failure to check some simple facts before flying.</p></div>

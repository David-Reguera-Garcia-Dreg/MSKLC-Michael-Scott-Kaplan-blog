<P>I can always count on Cristian Secară to send me mail about random internationalization issues, whether or not they are in&nbsp;Microsoft products. :-)</P>
<P>Just the other day he pointed a new one out to me, this one in Community Server (the technology behind <A class="" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap">SIAO</A> and of the rest of the <A class="" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/">MSDN Blogs</A> and others):</P>

<P><FONT face="times new roman,times">Hi,<BR><BR>On all msdn's blogs, so including yours, there is a problem with my "stored" name after posting a comment (the "remember me" feature), when I am coming back, or when I simply refersh the page.<BR><BR>See the snapshots. Usually I am using Opera, but it does the same with IE.<BR><BR>It does the same on Tudor Galoș's blog for example (</FONT><A href="http://studentclub.ro/tudorg/default.aspx"><FONT face="times new roman,times">http://studentclub.ro/tudorg/default.aspx</FONT></A><FONT face="times new roman,times">), which blog structure I suspect is something based on same software as the msdn one.<BR><BR>At the same time, there are other various blogs around, some also utf-8 encoded, where my remembered name always appears correctly.<BR><BR>It is not that tragic, but it's annoying. When posting, if I forget to delete the two „Äƒ” utf-8 low-level characters displayed and replace them with my „ă”, then the posted comment will also be displayed back with „Äƒ”.<BR><BR>Maybe you can report this to whom might be interested in correcting this bug, assuming it is not a known bug ...<BR><BR>Thank you,<BR>Cristi</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>I'll include the screenshots he included so you know what we are talking about (both for IE and for Opera):</P>

<P>This time the bug is in the site cookie that Community Server creates, which is writing out the name to remember in UTF-8 but then reading it back as something else (probably Encoding.Default?).</P>

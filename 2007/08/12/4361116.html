<h1>English as a NEW second language...</h1>

<P>I have been meaning to write something about a recent traumatic experience that happened to me, but things have been so hectic that I haven't had the chance.</P>
<P>It even involves language a bit!</P>
<P>This is the story of a haircut.</P>
<P>But let me back up for a second and explain one important point -- the fact that I hate changing hairstylists.</P>
<P>My last regular stylist was wonderful, and I loved the work she did. She was the manager of a HairMasters, and I liked her&nbsp;enough that when they moved&nbsp;her to manage a different location (in Issaquah) I even followed.</P>
<P>Did I mention I hate changing stylists?</P>
<P>Anyway, she ended up getting married and she left the job. I have been&nbsp;holding off&nbsp;trying to find a new one, and going to SuperCuts type places.</P>
<P>Although, come to think of it, I guess I found Autumn by accident too -- going to HairMasters to avoid finding a new stylist when my last one stopped working at Elegant Affair.</P>
<P>Anyway, enough digressing.</P>
<P>I have been going to SuperCuts, getting my hair cut ideally every three weeks (though in practice usually 4-6 because of how much I suck at the whole work/life balance thing).</P>
<P>At my last haircut, the woman I got was not a native English speaker. It would be fair to say that not only had she learned English as a second language (ESL), but that she was in the process of learning English as a brand new second language.</P>
<P>Suffice to say that language as a means of communicating vital concepts and ideas was not happening that day at the SuperCuts.</P>
<P>Not her fault, not mine -- just a failure to communicate.</P>
<P>They even offered not to charge but I'm not that guy, I paid for the cut.</P>
<P>In the end I could not comb my hair back (which is what I have been doing for years) because it was too short -- combing it back would mean having most of it sticking up right in the air.</P>
<P>So I went with the idea of combing it forward. Like a bowl but slightly less organized.</P>
<P>I planned to just have it that way until I could comb it back again, but a whole bunch of people whose opinions I respect actually seem to like it this way better. Some of them even read this blog, maybe one or two of them will&nbsp;read this very post.</P>
<P>Hello if you fall in one of the above categories (oh, and hi if you think you are in one of those categories but aren't; I won't embarrass you by telling you that you are one of those people!).</P>
<P>So I might keep the hairstyle. It is slightly less work if I can remember not to try to make it go back when I am running my fingers through it, which I'm sure I'll learn to remember eventually.</P>
<P>Hell,&nbsp;if I can manage to&nbsp;take a picture with the camera on the MacBook Pro (this is neither a hardware or a software thing, it is just that I am terrible at having pictures taken of me due to the fact that I have smile issues&nbsp;as I have mentioned <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/07/29/4115581.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/07/29/4115581.html">before</A></STRONG>), then I may even update the picture in the <STRONG>About Me</STRONG> section on the right, with the new hairstyle.</P>

<p>In one of my haircut accidents I have asked for a &quot;1 inch long&quot; and I got something like &quot;1 cm long&quot; :-)</p>
<p>The explanation was the &quot;this is 1 inch for us&quot; (which is funny now, but I did not find it so funny then :-)</p>
<p>It looks like the problem was not the language (she was speaking English at native level, as far as I can tell), but she used the &quot;electrical thing&quot; with &quot;accessory number 1&quot;</p>
<p>So I have learned that &quot;haircut number 1&quot; is not the same as a &quot;1 inch long,&quot; and I have also learned that in fact I kind of like hair that short, especially in summer :-)</p></div>

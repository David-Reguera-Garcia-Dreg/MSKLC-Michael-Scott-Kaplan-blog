<P>A while back, Windows&nbsp;Fundamentals developer <A class="" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ryanmy/" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ryanmy/">Ryan Myers</A> asked me a question via email that I could not find a few days later (and did not remember who sent it,&nbsp;I only remembered&nbsp;that it had to do with Index Server). </P>
<P>Anyway, I found the message yesterday (looks like it ended up in the wrong folder by accident)&nbsp;and even though it is way too late to be of use, I thought I'd go ahead and try and cover it a bit. </P>
<P>Sorry for the delay, Ryan. :-(</P>

<P><EM><FONT face="times new roman,times">Hi Michael,<BR><BR>I’ve been helping a friend with a test indexing app inside a game server and came across your blog posts from last year on the IWordBreaker interface from Indexing Server.&nbsp; I had a quick question that maybe you could help me with.<BR><BR>He’s writing this server to be international, and wants to wordbreak properly; the game client sends an LCID as part of the connection process.&nbsp; Some Googling pointed me to HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\ContentIndex\Language – as far as I can tell, he can iterate over all subkeys and compare the Locale value to the LCID, and if it matches, convert the WordBreaker CLSID to a GUID and CoCreate away.&nbsp; However, although this works, it seems a little ugly.<BR><BR>Is there a way to get to these classes without trawling the Registry?&nbsp; If not, that’s fine; I’m just curious if there’s an official way to do it. J<BR><BR>Thanks,<BR>~rjm</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The post Ryan was&nbsp;talking about was <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/03/14/395199.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/03/14/395199.html">You toucha my letters, IWordBreaker you face (or, Language-specific processing, #3)</A></STRONG>.</P>
<P>As it turns out, there really doesn't seem to be a better way. Though I can at least point to some official documentation now (I might be wrong but I am not sure it actually existed back then). </P>
<P>The topic is entitled <A class="" href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms692084.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms692084.aspx">Platform SDK: Indexing Service Registry Entries</A>, and the topic actually points to some methods off of the <A class="" href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms691558.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms691558.aspx">AdminIndexServer</A> object for programatically setting and retrieving the entries, if that makes it easier (it was apparently done to make scripting these things easier?).</P>
<P>There is a particular page with details on the <A class="" href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms692116.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms692116.aspx">Language-Specific Registry Entries</A> which might also be useful (and talks about the Language_Dialect subkey off the key above which I have never actually seen on any machine).</P>
<P>Of course you'll notice that these are all LCID (well actually LANGID but they call&nbsp;it LCID bound). In their defense they may not have been at that presentation I talked about in <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/07/23/4021529.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/07/23/4021529.html">Your LCID sucks</A></STRONG>, or they may not have believed it. In its own way this is unfortunate since there is documentation&nbsp;for anyone to create their own word breakers and stemmers, for any language (though every language has to fit within the LCID limitations).</P>
<P>We&nbsp;may have a suggestion or two here to make to the team. More on this another day...&nbsp;:-)</P>

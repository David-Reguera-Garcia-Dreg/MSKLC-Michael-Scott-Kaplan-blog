<P>Sorry to all of my regular readers who have had trouble getting their SIAO fix for the last few days....</P>
<P>I actually have a whole bunch of posts to put up related to&nbsp;the almost entirely awesome TypeCon 2007&nbsp;and such, and I will try to start getting them up this week, though between COSD training (I am presenting on Thursday<FONT size=1><SUP>1</SUP></FONT>) and UTC (which is happening as we speak) I am pretty much doing two weeks worth of work this week.</P>
<P>The Thursday presentation is currently fully booked,&nbsp;but since it is Thursday at 2-4pm and the weather forecast claims 70Â° and sunny, so I am anticipating some no-shows.</P>
<P>But I am still around and will be prolific quite shortly!</P>
<P mce_keep="true">&nbsp;</P>
<P><EM>1 - If you are in COSD you'll want to be there (link <A class="" href="http://mylearning/eclass.aspx?cid=CLAS2007071113425907050248" mce_href="http://mylearning/eclass.aspx?cid=CLAS2007071113425907050248">here</A> for internal COSD folks -- other internal folks can't do it, sorry!), if you are in WEX I'll be doing&nbsp;something quite&nbsp;similar&nbsp;at the end of the month and I'll keep you posted on that....</EM></P>

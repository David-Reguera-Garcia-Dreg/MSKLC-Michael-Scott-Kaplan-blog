<P>Wherever&nbsp;John&nbsp;Bonham is, I doubt he'd be very happy about this.</P>
<P>Regular readers&nbsp;may remember my post from almost two years ago entitled <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/09/17/470413.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/09/17/470413.html">Is Excel CSV misusing NLS functionality?</A></STRONG> that explains how Excel's CSV import functionality depends on the LOCALE_SLIST setting from Regional and Language Options.</P>
<P>I still think the design there is bad, but it is easy enough to work around, so I am able to get over my outrage quickly enough when I remember it again....</P>
<P>Then the other day the email I received via the Contact link was:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2>
<P><EM>Hi<BR><BR>We created a Macro used to Save a workbook in .csv format.<BR><BR>In Regional Setting we changed our list separator as ~. But when we run Macro we are still getting output as comma separated not ~ separated. What's going on</EM></P></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Ordinarily the lack of consistency between input and output would bother me, though in this case since I didn't care for the original design, I have to admit that it is not something I am terribly eager to see people try hard to make consistency work.</P>
<P>Though jokes aside, this looks like more of a difference in the "convert via UI" vs. "convert programatically" more than anything else. Which in its own way makes the weirdness kind of appealing to me in a strange way....</P>

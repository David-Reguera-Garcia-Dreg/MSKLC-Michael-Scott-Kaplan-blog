<h1>Are you Mr. Kaplan?</h1>

<P>Those were the exact words of the person on the phone, those words in the title.</P>
<P>I should back up a minute.</P>
<P>I have a land line phone with Verizon that I only use for emergencies like that recent <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/12/15/1299969.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/12/15/1299969.html">power outage</A></STRONG> and also to torture telemarketers (I am not on the do-not-call lists; I only give the phone number to the sort of people who might sell things so I can treat every call like entertainment if I am going to even bother answering it).</P>
<P>The phone has every service stripped down and it is listed (another source of telemarketers, the phone book!).</P>
<P>Anyway, where was I?</P>
<P>Oh yeah. This guy on the phone asked "Are you Mr. Kaplan?"</P>
<P>I figure there is no harm identifying myself since the number is listed. "Yes," I respond.</P>
<P>"Vice president of Microsoft Customer Service?" he asked.</P>
<P>Hmmmm. </P>
<P>"No, that's not me," I reply.</P>
<P>He ends the call quickly. "I'm sorry, I must have a wrong number."</P>
<P>I guess he was looking for <A class="" href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/kaplan/default.mspx" mce_href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/kaplan/default.mspx">Richard Kaplan</A>. Perhaps just going through the phone book calling all the Kaplan entries&nbsp;in the Seattle metropolitan area.</P>
<P>I must admit that it is an interesting way to call product support! </P>
<P>I might have commented had he not hung up so quickly.</P>
<P>And you know I always tell people that&nbsp;I am not Microsoft product support, but Richard can't really get away with that, I suppose. </P>
<P>I'd love to know how this all turns out but Richard and I are not golfing buddies and I am pretty sure we aren't related, so&nbsp;I guess I'll never know....</P>
<P>As an FYI to people, this is likely not the most effective way to get in touch with customer support (and also I never answer technical questions on that phone so it is not the best way to get a hold of me, either!).</P>

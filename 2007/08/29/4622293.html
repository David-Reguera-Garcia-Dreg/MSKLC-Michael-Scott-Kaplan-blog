<P><EM>You know the drill, nothing technical....</EM>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Sometimes a request is made of me and the question is asked in such a way that I just don't know exactly how to respond....</P>
<P>Like when I got home today and my neighbor (who was outside in the porch, holding&nbsp;a cigarette like it was something semi-precious that she do not know quite what to do with) kind of held up the cigarette and asked if I had a light.</P>
<P>I thought back to the last time&nbsp;I had a cigarette (September 24, 1994) and that I honestly didn't remember the last time I had a lighter. I then corrected myself, I had those matches in my apartment still from the outage I mentioned <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/12/15/1299969.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/12/15/1299969.html"><STRONG>before</STRONG></A>, though they were far enough away that I couldn't see scooting to my door, going inside, finding the matches, scooting back out to my neighbor, and giving them to her.</P>
<P>So I chickened out. I just kind of shrugged and told her "Sorry, I don't smoke any more" with what I hope was the right tone to indicate that I was, in fact, sorry.</P>
<P>Hopefully she is not a regular reader of this blog; if she sees this post then the jig is up, as it were. Sorry about that, I really just didn't see any reasonable logistics to make it happen....</P>
<P>And then there was earlier in the day, when one of the program managers&nbsp;I talk to from time to time (name omitted&nbsp;for what should become obvious reasons, presently)&nbsp;had an interesting request that I did not know quite what to do with.</P>
<P>The exact words: "...in the future, you should space out your interesting posts (by interesting, read relevant to me). If&nbsp;I<EM>'</EM>m having a hard time actually caring about the post&nbsp;I should be caring about because theres another more interesting post, its a valid point!"</P>
<P>I had literally no idea what to do with this one, and was essentially rendered speechless. </P>
<P>Truly anyone who found every post to be useful would scare the living hell out of me (since I find each post somewhat interesting, how I feel about myself should be obvious here!). But since I wouldn't expect anyone to find every post interesting, the notion of spacing out the interesting posts is a fascinating one to contemplate though very hard to actually deliver.</P>
<P>My response was something very respectful along the lines of "I'll do my best" though the eye roll that went along with it probably negates the sincerity of the words.</P>
<P>As does this post? :-)</P>
<P>Which of course leads to a meta question -- would&nbsp;a program manager who wanted interesting posts to be metered find a post about that request to be interesting?</P>
<P><EM>Infuriating</EM>, sure. But <STRONG>interesting</STRONG>? </P>
<P>Sometimes a request is made of me and the question is asked in such a way that I just don't know exactly how to respond....</P>

<p>That way you are forcing a limit upon yourself, and are mixing it up for the readers, who while sitting on the edge of their chairs for the next thrilling installment of &quot;What happens when I cut-n-paste characters from this page I can't understand, and why?&quot; also appreciate a bit of human interest as well...</p>
<p>That aside, keep up the blog. &nbsp;The topics, while not 100% relevant to the work I'm doing, do trigger &quot;warning sign&quot;s with regards to how the data I'm working with is going to be corrupted in the future.</p></div>

<P>I went to Fred Meyer today to pick up a prescription.</P>
<P>I actually drove there rather than scooted (it is getting colder, and I'm trying not to get sick due to the consequences of it).</P>
<P>And I came across an interesting phenomenon, or rather I recognized one that has been there for a while.</P>
<P>Or maybe this is a re-run of the concepts I talked about in <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/03/05/544063.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/03/05/544063.html"><STRONG>That handicapped placard</STRONG></A>, but it seems a little different, to me.</P>
<P>I'll let you be the judge...</P>
<P>When I first got the handicapped parking pass, I could comfortably walk short distances without using a cane. But I invariably did use the cane when I noticed the way people would look at an apparently young healthy guy parking in a gimp space.</P>
<P>Of the people unhappy with me parking there till they notice the cane, I find it is the non-handicapped most likely to say something or even get adamant about it. </P>
<P>Some of them just being concerned, others not wanting to see someone take advantage after they chose not to.</P>
<P>Anyway, now I often use the scooter, which I guess makes the pass less important since I can make it in from a distance.</P>
<P>Though now, if someone sees the scooter, they don't mind me parking in the handicapped spot -- like I am provably entitled or something.</P>
<P>So when I really did need it, people were more likely to give me a hard time than now, when I probably don't need it.</P>
<P>Am I the only one who notes the irony of their approval now?</P>

<p>Next time I see someone on a handicapped parking lot use a scooter, I'll shout at him about how he/she knows better than anyone that these places are too precious to be occupied by someone with a scooter :-)</p></div>

On those days, I curse that I don't carry a spare cane in the back seat to 'prove' my entitlement. Sad, but true.</p>
<p>Great post! Thanks for sharing</p>

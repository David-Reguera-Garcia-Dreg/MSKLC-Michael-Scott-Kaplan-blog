<P>I have talked a whole bunch of times about the disconnect between the hardware side of keyboards and the software "layout" side of them. Like in <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/01/21/357960.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/01/21/357960.html"><STRONG>Keyboards: hardware vs. software</STRONG></A>, for example.</P>
<P>If I am in Windows and I am looking at the device manager, I can see an item there for my keyboard:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/WinKbd01.png"></P>
<P>(ignore that disabled Wireless&nbsp;adapter, I just didn't need it enabled just then; it&nbsp;is&nbsp;not related!)&nbsp;</P>
<P>and if I then plug in a Dell USB keyboard I have lying around (I grabbed it from work for reasons I will explain momentarily) it then adds another entry to the list:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/WinKbd02.png"></P>
<P>Now you'll see no details are available on what kind of layout the hardware has. Even the 101/102 key entry for my laptop (a keyboard which I guarantee you does not have either 101 or 102 keys!) shows the problem.</P>
<P>The keyboards do not, as a rule, communicate about what they are to the computer. Even that USB layout is clearly plug-and-play,&nbsp;and not really very plug-and-communicate-what-it-looks-like.</P>
<P>The initial keyboard is figured out through a very complex mechanism of choosing based on OEM decisions (the OEM knows what hardware it bundles, so it just makes sure that is the starting selection).</P>
<P>This can occasionally lead to problems if there is no good information for particular hardware items (the Japanese 109-key hardware is a great example of a&nbsp;device that doesn't work all that well in Windows due to missing information on it, a fact that has apparently bitten an OEM or two while trying to put together the hardware to ship).</P>
<P>In the end, you can change the setting, but it isn't easy so unless you know the answer. There are a lot of choices....</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/WinKbd03.png"></P>
<P>I have to admit I like what Apple does here a bit more. :-)</P>
<P>If you plug in that same USB keyboard to a MacBook Pro running&nbsp;OS X 10.5 like mine, Leopard knows it has the same problem of identification of the keyboard hardware:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/MacKbd02.png"></P>
<P>This wizard then asks a fews clarifying questions, such as this one:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/MacKbd03.png"></P>
<P>or this other one:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/MacKbd04.png"></P>
<P>and then it eventually decides it knows:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/MacKbd05.png"></P>
<P><EM>Some time next week I need to try out the tons of different language keyboards I have in my office to see if there are other questions I can make it ask!</EM> :-)</P>
<P>Anyway, this just strikes me as a much easier/better answer than forcing someone to know the exact hardware in question, right?</P>
<P>Kudos to Apple on this one, a much more usable solution for that whole out-of-the-box experience....</P>

<p>What they meant to be talking about was if this dialog comes up and the thing that was plugged in was not a keyboard, then there are no worries. But the text is not entirely clear (and they never got into the CANCEL button on the Mac as much as they probably should have!).</p>

<p>How difficult would it be to add a feature like this to Windows? As an outsider I get the impression that there is so much bureaucracy and politics within Microsoft that adding simple user-oriented features such as a keyboard identification wizard is nigh on impossible -- please correct me if I am totally wrong here.</p></div>

<p>I do think that if MS did go down this road they could do an even more complete job here (finding everything from the 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, etc. keyboards in short order -- each with minimal effort), but the trick is convincing someone that the current solution is insufficient.</p>

<p>At the very beginning of the game you go through a technical check, and the tech guy holds an object up, then down, and asks you too look at it (the way an eye doctor would do).</p>
<p>This detects you controller preference for up-down behavior (push up look up, or push up look down (airplane control type)).</p>

<p>Mac OS X actually launches an application which asks these things. To avoid configuring the keyboard, you just quit the application (usually by closing the window).</p>
<p>It's obvious when you're sitting in front of the Mac.</p></div>

<p>I do agree that a cancel button in this case is definitely merited, but I've seen that dialog a few times and never even thought twice about how to cancel it.</p>
<p>&quot;and they never got into the CANCEL button on the Mac as much as they probably should have!&quot;</p>
<p>What? It isn't the &quot;Cancel&quot; problem the Mac has trouble with, it is that stupid Windows &quot;Apply&quot; button. You know, the button that acts like an OK button, but can't be cancelled (or undone)‚Ä¶</p>

<p><a id="6020957" href="#6020957">#</a> <strong>nex</strong> on 9 Nov 2007 10:44 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>About the Halo thing ... IIRC there _is_ some calibration taking place there (you could call that configuration of you like), but it definitely doesn't set your preference about the vertical axis automatically. The virtual instructor explicitly has you try out both options, then sets the default option, and explains how you can invert that setting again, should you like the alternative better. It's a fun way for setting preferences in a game, and more games should do that. However I'm not sure how well you could translate that into other apps. Games have unique UIs and you have to be able to learn a new one quickly. An app with a Cocoa GUI, OTOH, should behave just like all the others.</p>
<p>Anyways, identifying a piece of hardware is an entirely separate matter; it's not about the user's preferences at all. The method shown above is quite simple and convenient. Linux installtion programs have done that for ages. No idea how long Apple were prodiving this, I've never seen that dialog. (The only keyboard I've ever connected to my Mac is a one-handed one and requires a special driver; it's not a HIG device apparently.)</p>
<p>And regarding Zooba's comment about WTF-worthiness: This comment is entirely justified, and I'm disappointed by the amount of apologetics here saying there's nothing wrong with the dialog. First of all, the text in the dialog is very badly written. First it tells you that the keyboard is not usable until it is identified, but doesn't tell you about alternate ways of identifying it, making it look like you'll absolutely have to go through that routine. But then it tells you that you can skip &quot;this step&quot; if it's working properly. How can you tell whether it's working properly as long as it's not usable? And what is it with the talk about another USB input device that is not a keyboard? My best guess is that they mean if you have, say, a mouse, then you can use that to identify the keyboard in some other way. But it has to be a USB mouse, a bluetooth mouse would be no good? Wha?</p>
<p>Secondly, it's not obvious that &quot;this step&quot; is the only thing that app does and that &quot;skip this step&quot; is the same as quitting the app. Therefore, a 'skip' button or at least a 'quit' button would definitely not hurt!</p>
<p>In practice there might hardly ever be a problem. The dialog has probably been tested a couple of times and been refined to a point where inexperienced users will end up doing the right thing. (Experienced ones know what to do anyways.) But even when they do, they'll end up with a slight aftertaste of confusion. For those who first need to figure out what's going on, the design of that dialog should be more educating and less patronizing.</p></div>
<p><a id="6028587" href="#6028587">#</a> <strong>Watts</strong> on 9 Nov 2007 4:12 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Actually, some Mac programs have &quot;Apply&quot; buttons, too. I think Windows programs sometimes go a little overboard in their use of it, but it's nice to have at times.</p>
<p>As for moving close buttons and what have you, well. People used to the Mac think the Mac is intuitive, are frustrated by Windows... and are usually surprised when someone who's been using Windows for a decade sits down in front of a Mac and gets frustrated. :) But in either case, it's not really a different language, just a different dialect, and arguments about clear superiority of one or the other tend to be... exaggerated.</p>
<p>I like the fact that Apple goes through the steps to identify the keyboard, but the dialog box could certainly be refined -- although I'm not sure I'd call it &quot;patronizing.&quot; Not to any greater degree than most &quot;wizard&quot;-style dialog box progressions are, at least.</p></div>

<h1>Michael's Keyboard Laws for Developers, Part 2</h1>

<P><EM>See also the first law (<A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/11/15/6252257.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/11/15/6252257.html"><STRONG>VK_A is not always 'A'</STRONG></A>)</EM></P>
<P>The next law is also simple to state and occasionally obvious though more often it does not occur to people....</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=4>Not every keyboard contains every VK_* value</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>It is just so easy for people to attach functionality to keys based on their VK_* names.</P>
<P>Like an incrementing/decrementing functionality atop VK_OEM_PLUS and VK_OEM_MINUS.</P>
<P>But the truth is that very few keyboards have all of the values in them, so if your application relies on them being there then you will see some people unable to use it.</P>
<P>I even formally laid out some examples in <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/04/02/567003.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/04/02/567003.html"><STRONG>Punctuation keys can make lousy shortcuts</STRONG></A>, previously.</P>
<P>And there is no rule intrinsic to keyboards that requires all of the VK_A to VK_Z values to always be present, either. Though usually they are and the only real problem is that one cannot assume their identity, since e.g. <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/11/15/6252257.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/11/15/6252257.html"><STRONG>VK_A is not always 'A'</STRONG></A>.</P>
<P>Well, the way developers look for these values without remembering that the end user may not ever know about them or their identities can also be a problem.</P>

<p>For anything alphanumeric you should be interpreting characters rather than keyboard events.</p></div>

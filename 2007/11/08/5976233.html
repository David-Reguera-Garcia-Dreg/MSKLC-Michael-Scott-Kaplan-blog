<P>I got email from Mark Crispin<SUP><FONT size=1>1</FONT></SUP> via the Contact form several months back<FONT size=1><SUP>2</SUP></FONT> that said:</P>

<P>Wow that was a hell of a mail -- when the people who so much larger than life read your blog, you feel good all week.</P>
<P>The funny part was that&nbsp;the mail did not have his name on it, but it had his e-mail address. But hell, I recognized the e-mail address. :-)</P>
<P>Plus I got to meet Mark at the 31st IUC, which was also very cool....</P>
<P>It's funny, the feedback from posts like <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/05/09/593108.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/05/09/593108.html"><STRONG>The font width is broken? Well, fix it!</STRONG></A> and <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/02/19/535046.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/02/19/535046.html"><STRONG>Where are the IE plain text fonts?</STRONG></A> and <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/08/23/712587.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/08/23/712587.html"><STRONG>What would a 'Kartika Fixed' font for Malayalam DO, exactly?</STRONG></A> has been mixed.</P>
<P>Some people accept my definition of having the script fit within cells that line up while others feel that the "one character per cell" requirement if simply way too important to the core definition of a fixed width font.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">But it is not that big of a stretch really, especially when one considers the arbitrary way that FULL WIDTH characters are given double width in CJK fonts (discussed previously in <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/09/11/463672.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/09/11/463672.html"><STRONG>Fonts that are 'fixed-width' even if they do not claim to be</STRONG></A>). </P>
<P mce_keep="true">How much harder is it to imagine that a complex script would also have things line up even if each character may not take up exactly one cell? :-)</P>
<P mce_keep="true">But let's set that aside for a moment, along with my passive fantasies of a <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/05/09/593108.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/05/09/593108.html"><STRONG>Comic Sans MS Fixed</STRONG></A> that no one thinks would be a very good idea to create....</P>
<P mce_keep="true">We'll move on to question Mark had about the best fixed width font that covers all of the characters that are practical to be in a fixed width font....</P>
<P mce_keep="true">The real problem with CJK fonts is that they tend to limit themselves from a coverage perspective to characters that the target language contains. so in the end, the chances of a Japanese font with very much in the way of Hangul or of much that is ideographic outside of JIS X 213 is pretty slim -- which makes MS Gothic (a Japanese font) a less than ideal choice, even if it does have the ideographic style one might prefer.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">Fuller Hangul coverage is more common in Korean fonts, but fuller ideographic coverage is common in Chinese fonts, so between that and the fact that neither is common in Japanese, and there is no good choice for a sorta fixed width font with good coverage of all of those characters....</P>
<P mce_keep="true">But the trade-off solution is to start with the font with either the most glyphs or even better the most glyphs that you are likely to be seeing. And then counting on GDI font linking to pick up the rest (hopefully with a font that has the same metrics so that the character widths stay similar.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">The idea of a fixed with font with coverage of much more of Unicode is a tempting one to me, though many others don't seem to think so. Especially people who would have to either create such a font or fund the creation thereof.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">Though I am still trying to find a way to make it happen, and a way to have <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/05/09/593108.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/05/09/593108.html"><STRONG>Comic Sans MS Fixed</STRONG></A> created. It's about the journey not the destination. so why not try and tilt a few windmills....</P>

Normally I'd settle for a font like Meiryo, but for some reason PuTTY does not pick it up in its font picker window. I instead opted for GulimChe since it supports a lot of characters and is readable even at smaller point sizes.</p>
<p>But yes, the fonts are a bit lacking...</p></div>
<p><a id="6014280" href="#6014280">#</a> <strong>JM</strong> on 9 Nov 2007 6:36 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>I must admit I'm at a loss to understand why, in these days of modern digital typography, people want fixed-width fonts at all, let alone full Unicode support for them. It's true that &quot;lining up things&quot; becomes trivial with a fixed-width font, but tab stops and columns have worked for a long time with variable-width fonts. Even the venerable character terminals which were once restricted to fixed-width fonts are increasingly replaced with console windows in a GUI.</p>
<p>One day I decided to switch to a proportional font for writing code as a &quot;why the hell not&quot;, and I've never looked back. It just looks so much better. I've been using Georgia for a long time, until Cambria came along and dethroned it as my favorite font for writing code in. I don't mind that my code no longer looks &quot;computer-y&quot;, and I can promise you big productivity and readability increases once you stop trying to line up things on a column-by-column basis. All you need is tabs!</p></div>

<h1>Is it a 7:01 post, or a 7:16 post?</h1>

<P><EM><FONT color=#ff0000>Yet another metablog post -- were&nbsp;they not so pathetic I'd start a category for them....</FONT></EM></P>
<P>So I am basically posting every day, usually at 7:01 AM and 07:16 AM.</P>
<P>It is sometimes hard to know which should come first, though.</P>
<P>Usually it is the post that I'm least unhappy to have up first on SiaO until the next day.</P>
<P>And that is good as far as it goes, though there is still some difficulty here.</P>
<P>Like when I finish writing the first one, I don't always have a freaking clue what the second post will be.</P>
<P>So although I might have some idea how good I think the first post is (using my own arbitrary internal metric), I have no clue what the second one will be, or how it will stack up.</P>
<P>Add to that the fact that I am usually way too stubborn and/or&nbsp;lazy&nbsp;to change the time of the first post if the second one is measurably better or worse.</P>
<P>And with a marked lack of interest in trying to artificially make&nbsp;that second&nbsp;post better or worse just to make it all work out with the best post last.</P>
<P>Of course my readers always have different opinions. Like earlier I was pointing out to someone how I has just written <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/11/08/5976233.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/11/08/5976233.html"><STRONG>The [non-]progress of the über-fixed width fonts</STRONG></A> and was not sure which post it should be.</P>
<P>"Make it the first post" was the advice (not everyone would necessarily like that one best, clearly!).</P>
<P>Of course after explaining the whole 7:01/7:16 thing I decided that if that explanation was going to be a blog post (which it obviously became), it had to be the 7:01 post (metablog posts don't deserve first position status, they are second class citizens).</P>
<P>Hopefully people won't be too disappointed with <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/11/08/5976233.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/11/08/5976233.html"><STRONG>The [non-]progress of the über-fixed width fonts</STRONG></A> (I kind of like it, myself!).</P>
<P mce_keep="true">&nbsp;</P>

<h1>Clarification on the singer/songwriter catgeory over on the sidebar</h1>

<P>I had someone suggest that</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><EM><FONT face="times new roman,times">
<P>I notice that you have a Singer / Songwriters section in your right sidebar, with various links.<BR><BR>I like to write song lyrics and like to dream or rather romance about being a singer-songwriter and maybe dream with just a little chance of it coming true of some of my lyrics being recorded by people who can do one or more of sing well and play musical instruments.<BR><BR>I was just wondering, due to your interest in singer / songwriters whether you might consider a thread with the idea that people could, using the comment facility and external links, together have a go at producing some song lyrics, some music, a performance by a singer and maybe a video and maybe artwork for a CD and, well, have some fun doing it and finding out what could actually be done in a blog post and its comments with a few external links.</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Sorry,&nbsp;<A class="" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap"><STRONG>SiaO</STRONG></A> isn't that kind of blog.... </P>
<P>It is true that I will&nbsp;occasionally post about song lyrics (probably 1/100th of what I listen to and truly enjoy and/or completely hate the lyrics of).</P>
<P>And it is also true that&nbsp;sometimes I will post about shows I go to (probably 1/10th of the ones I go to -- not even a good show always has a hook for a post!).</P>
<P>But I am not a singer and am no truly longer a songwriter&nbsp;except in&nbsp;the most severely occasional sense (a sense that I share with pretty much no one, these days, let alone sharing it with all 27 of you who are reading here regularly).</P>
<P>It gets back to the whole <STRONG>this blog is about stuff that interests me</STRONG> thing -- people getting together here to try to organically create songs through the medium of thisw blog? Doesn't pass the basic scratch test....</P>
<P>Plus I am enough of a music snob to shudder at the presumption that such a process in&nbsp;a blog such as mine&nbsp;could actually create music I'd ever want to listen to. :-)</P>
<P>I guess we all know what it's really about -- <STRONG>access</STRONG>. And&nbsp;occasionally someone's approach to getting me a CD&nbsp;is so novel that I promise to get put in front of somebody who could get it listened to in the background of somebody else. But even that is a pretty rare thing, and definitely not the sort of thing I'd ever want the blog to turn into.</P>
<P>Sorry about that, I have to keep up the (admittedly low) standards I have set here....</P>

<P>Over in the comments section of <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/02/24/379466.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/02/24/379466.html"><STRONG>The keyboard does not do what I tell it to!</STRONG></A>,Maria asks:</P>

<P><FONT face="times new roman,times"><EM>I have gone through all the comments in this blog, still can not solve my problem. My problem is almost the same as Kate's. When I type / , it shows é, when I type ? (shift+?), it shows É. I tried that Alt + Shift many times, suddenly I got / and ?. But when I open another file, same problems come again. And the question is I don't know how I made my last time successful. I guess that was just a coincidence.<BR><BR>Please help me!<BR><BR>Thanks</EM></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Now I don't want to knock workarounds, as they can be very handy. Truly.</P>
<P>But in this case it looks like there is more going on here, so we should look a little deeper to see if what is going on can be determined.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Looking at what the ALT+SHIFT does for a moment, it switches the keyboard layout to one of the other layouts that are in the interactive user's input language list.</P>
<P>The fact that users often don't see&nbsp;the language switching kind of implies that the language bar is not visible, or at least is not providing helpful information....</P>
<P>So let's take a look at the Language Bar. First we go to Regional and Language Options, in that middle tab and hit that button:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/keyboardweirdness01.png"></P>
<P>You will likely see two or more keyboards listed there in that next dialog:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/keyboardweirdness02.png"></P>
<P>Certainly I expect that Maria would see this, since the ALT+SHIFT switching worked at least once.</P>
<P>And there may even be more than two&nbsp;-- note how&nbsp;she mentioned she&nbsp;had hit the keystroke combination&nbsp;many times....</P>
<P>You may want to delete any layouts you are not using from the dialog.</P>
<P>Let's deal with the other issue, if at least two keyboards are not needed.</P>
<P>And now since it sounds like new processes are not getting the right layout by default -- let's fix up that process default choice in that very top dropdown:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/keyboardweirdness03.png"></P>
<P>Make sure it is set to the one that you want for the default....&nbsp;</P>
<P>And&nbsp;now let's hit that <STRONG>Language Bar...</STRONG> button and deal with the fact that the Language Bar wasn't visible:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/keyboardweirdness04.png"></P>
<P>Aha, the list was intentionally made not visible -- how did that happen?</P>
<P>Ah well, easy enough to solve -- hit that first checkbox, and now the language bar will be there for when things shift.</P>
<P>The ALT+SHIFT workaround is fine for when you accidentally switch to a known layout that you have on your list -- but when the results are entirely unexpected, its good to try and figure out what might be configured inclorrectly....</P>

<P>I had reader Tamara ask me via the Contact link whether I only was willing to&nbsp;handle song lyric questions from people I knew.</P>
<P>And if not she had a song she wanted to ask about....</P>
<P>To be honest it had never come up before, but the song she had in mind was one I remembered from way back when it first came out, so I decided to say what the hell and talk about it. :-)</P>
<P>The song?</P>
<P>The Canadian&nbsp;band Len's "one hit wonder" song <STRONG>Steal My Sunshine</STRONG>.</P>
<P>The song had many different versions (there was even an import CD somewhere in my collection with four different versions of the song on it!).</P>
<P>The source of the song is kind of a nice story. </P>
<P>Marc Costanzo, one half of Len, wrote it back in 1996, after he and his sister (Sharon Costanzo) were going through some pretty tumultuous times. The two of them had a really bad fight, and Sharon wasn't talking to Marc at all. Marc had no idea how to fix things up or what to say, and he went home and wrote <STRONG>Steal My Sunshine</STRONG> to try and tell Sharon (who really is his sunshine) how he felt -- how much he really needed her in his life.</P>
<P>If you look online you'll see a whole bunch of non-identical attempts at the lyrics. I'll put up my own from my listening to the aforementioned four versions of the song (Marc lines in <FONT color=#6600cc>PURPLE</FONT>, Sharon lines in <FONT color=#ff0000>RED</FONT>):</P>

<P>Now clearly some of this was probably written after&nbsp;Marc and Sharon&nbsp;managed to make up from the fight, and it would be great to fill in some of those details, too -- as there is a small amlount of distance between what we know and what the song says....</P>
<P><EM>And I do love the <STRONG>tare</STRONG> reference in the second verse -- and am pretty sure that is what it is, though most lyric sites assume that <STRONG>tear</STRONG> is the woukd there (as in to rip, not as in to cry). And not only because it makes more sense.</EM></P>
<P>In the meantime, I admit that I have a much easier time (when thinking aboiut the lyrics) identifying with some parts than I do with others -- because who of us can become if all we do is talk about what we would have done? It is a pretty inspired and determined statement of the need to make sure that in order to really feel like a <STRONG>human being</STRONG> that the most important step is to be a <STRONG>human doing</STRONG>.</P>
<P>And Sharon and Marc clearly did manage to patch things up; I think I would have been minded to accept the apology too, were it being directed to me -- clearly there are times that the lyrics <EM>do</EM> matter -- when we are saying we're sorry....</P>
<P>I now see the disadvantage of doing this sort of thing without having the long phone conversation -- there is no feedback system to see if I answered Tamara's question(s) about the song or if she had additional thoughts or insights herself!</P>

<p>This is probably one of my favorite songs of all time. But actually I &nbsp;read an interview some years back where the Burger Pimp said they were drunk and wrote the lyrics on napkins and found and sampled a beat from the disco hit &quot;More, More, More&quot; by The Andrea True Connection, all at like 3 in the morning. </p>
<p>It kind of makes more sense to me that way, because most if its just gibberish. Yet there are gems, and the line BP says, &quot;And of course you can't become if you only say what you would've done&quot; is about as absolute as it gets. </p>
<p>Pablo Picasso once said, &quot;It took me four years to paint like Raphael, but a lifetime to paint like a child.&quot; I think that is what's so beautiful about &quot;Steal My Sunshine&quot;; it's pure, simple, and meaningless, and yet has all the meaning in the world. </p></div>
<p><strong>Slurpeeeeeeee!?!</strong> on 24 Aug 2010 12:30 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>How does one make straws out of &#39;big fat slurpee treats?</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Daddy O' Four</strong> on 23 Mar 2012 4:20 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Hi guys. &nbsp;Found yer blog searching for the meaning of this song. &nbsp;It always makes me think of my 4-year-old daughter Rachel, whom we affectionately call Rae (or &#39;Ray&#39;), becasue she is our little &#39;Rae&#39; of sunshine becasue of her infectious beaming smile. &nbsp;Unfortunately, being four, she has sunk into a bit of a rotten streak lately and spend more time in the corner than smiling. &nbsp;This song reminds me of her because when she is behaving badly, she literally steals our &#39;sunshine!&#39;</p>
<p>On &quot;straws out of &quot;big fat slurpee treats&quot; I could only imagine the task requiring one to CONSUME a number frozen sticky beverages and link the straws together (as I may have done in my youth and have witnessed attempts by other youths). &nbsp;I remember the generic SLURPEE straws alway had that &#39;spoon&#39; tip that was conducive to connecting atop or asunder the flat end of another spraw :o]</p>
<p>Great post! Thanks for the insight!</p>

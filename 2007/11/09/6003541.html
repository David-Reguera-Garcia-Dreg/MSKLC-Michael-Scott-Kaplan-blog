<P><EM><FONT color=#ff0000>So non-technical that it's staggering -- stop reading now before </FONT></EM><EM><FONT color=#ff0000>you get sucked into it!</FONT></EM>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Very little&nbsp;respect I get. Like a phone conversation&nbsp;last&nbsp;night with a friend who called me during dinner:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><EM>"What on earth are you doing?"</EM></P>
<P><EM>"I'm eating dinner. You called me at dinnertime, you take what you get, right?"</EM></P>
<P><EM>"True. But what is it? Are you still&nbsp;eating crap these days?"</EM></P>
<P><EM>"It's Crunch Berries and Limonata."</EM></P>
<P><EM>"Hmmm... well, I guess the milk can offset the junk food cereal, and Crunch Berries has some street cred."</EM></P>
<P><EM>"Milk? What milk?"</EM></P>
<P><EM>"Um, the milk you pour in the cereal bowl!"</EM></P>
<P><EM>"I have no milk in this house, I'm milk soluble."</EM></P>
<P><EM>"What does that even mean?"</EM></P>
<P><EM>"You ever see The Wizard of Oz?"</EM></P>
<P><EM>"Sure, everybody has!"</EM></P>
<P><EM>"That scene with The Wicked Witch and the melting? She was water soluble. So...."</EM></P>
<P><EM>"And you are milk soluble?"</EM></P>
<P><EM>"Yes, exactly."</EM></P>
<P><EM>"Michael, that is disgusting."</EM></P>
<P><EM>"You're the one who asked, Hun."</EM></P>
<P><EM>"Isn't that kind of sexist, calling me 'Hun' like that?"</EM></P>
<P><EM>"No, I mean it like as in 'Attila the' so it's not really sexist at all."</EM></P>
<P><EM>"I guess I can live with that. So you are eating dry sugar cereal and washing it down with a sugary drink."</EM></P>
<P><EM>"Well, first of all I am not eating the cereal dry, and second of all Limonata is 12% lemon juice."</EM></P>
<P><EM>"But if you aren't putting in milk then how is the cereal not dry?"</EM></P>
<P><EM>"Wait for it...."</EM></P>
<P><EM>"Michael, please tell me you did not pour Limonata into your cereal bowl."</EM></P>
<P><EM>"Okay, I won't tell you that."</EM></P>
<P><EM>"That is completely disgusting!"</EM></P>
<P><EM>"More disgusting or less disgusting than the 'milk soluble' thing?"</EM></P>
<P><EM>"It's a toss-up, Michael. But it gives me a great idea for a new diet."</EM></P>
<P><EM>"How's that?"</EM></P>
<P><EM>"Every time&nbsp;I'm going to eat&nbsp;a meal, I just have you tell me about what you're eating -- and boom! Suddenly I'm not hungry any more!"</EM></P>
<P><EM>"Glad I can provide that valuable service,&nbsp;and backwash&nbsp;is an effect I really have always worked hard to encourage in the women in my life."</EM></P>
<P><EM>"A job well done, young man!"</EM></P>
<P><EM>"Look, can I eat here?"</EM></P>
<P><EM>"I can't say for sure, Michael. Give it&nbsp;a try, though."</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Like I said, very little respect I get.</P>
<P>But the Limonata and Crunch Berries thing? It actually works. Highly recommended....</P>

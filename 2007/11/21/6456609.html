<P>You might remember blogs like <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/03/20/1917161.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/03/20/1917161.html"><STRONG>Double Secret ANSI, part 2 (the brokenest one yet, sorry 'bout that!)</STRONG></A>&nbsp;and <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/06/25/3521939.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/06/25/3521939.html"><STRONG>Sometimes when you say 'the fix is in' you mean it in a good way</STRONG></A>, where a bad bug was introduced, reported, and then fixed, in both an upcoming&nbsp;service pack and in a hotfix.</P>
<P>But although it was easy to get th word out to one company that was affected, it seems that another company did not get the word.</P>
<P>So Adobe knows and has a solution for all of their nrfoken non-Unicode applications.</P>
<P>But clearly Skype might not, as per the following bug report in their database:</P>

<P>Could somebody with a login over there put this data in the bug? :-)</P>
<P>And while you are there you could suggest that they should move to Unicode....</P>

NetObjects Fusion still does the same today. Yahoo Messenger was the same until the recent verion 9 (beta); still, YM still has a major bug in that AltGr+A selects the whole text and then types &quot;a&quot;; this way the Romanian (Programmers) keyboard cannot be used to type ă and/or the Hungarian keyboard cannot be used to type &#228;.</p>
<p>As for Adobe, hmm, what Unicode ? They are not able to handle ANSI in some applications. The Touchup Text Tool in Adobe Acrobat assumes any 8 bit character to be CP1252 ...</p>

<p>I've done that just for you, Michael. &nbsp;It looks like they are doing some magic for Unicode input in some of their controls - e.g. the chat window. &nbsp;Try watching in Winspector Spy (Spy++ doesn't seem to be Unicode aware), you'll see a WM_CHAR 0x3F but the correct letter will appear in the control. &nbsp;In some other controls, you'll just see a 0x3F &quot;?&quot; &nbsp;Of course, this could just mean that they are using a mix of W and A functions for that particular window?</p></div>
<p><a id="6469360" href="#6469360">#</a> <strong>Luke Amery</strong> on 22 Nov 2007 6:38 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>At a guess it looks to me like the Skype front end is developed in Delphi. Delphi development generally centers around a class library (similar to the BCL in .Net) called the VCL. The VCL has not yet received your use unicode memo. Maybe you could get the message to Borland / Inprise / CodeGear whoever they are this week?</p></div>
<p><a id="6474134" href="#6474134">#</a> <strong>Marc Durdin</strong> on 22 Nov 2007 5:50 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>As Luke says, the VCL is not Unicode and I doubt it ever will be ... seeing as it's a legacy platform now.</p>
<p>The TMS/TNT Unicode Component Pack (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.tmssoftware.com/go/?tmsuni">http://www.tmssoftware.com/go/?tmsuni</a>) along with some little tweaks to VCL Forms (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.tavultesoft.com/keyman/documentation/unicodeinput.php">http://www.tavultesoft.com/keyman/documentation/unicodeinput.php</a>) will get the average Delphi application a pretty long way towards being Unicode compatible.</p></div>

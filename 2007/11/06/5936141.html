<P>Sometimes the problem is understanding -- the more one knows, the more cynical one becomes.</P>
<P>Last night was one of those odd music nights.</P>
<P>Somewhere between <STRONG>Real Bad News</STRONG> and <STRONG>Deathly</STRONG> and <STRONG>It's Not</STRONG> and <STRONG>Wise Up</STRONG> and <STRONG>Invisible Ink</STRONG> and <STRONG>Stupid Thing</STRONG>, all good music but a bit more depressing than I needed, I realized that I need something&nbsp;a little different.</P>
<P>So I tried Celine Dion instead. Only in French, which to be honest is the only way I can stand listening to her for some reason (I don't speak French,l there is just something very soothing to me about a woman's voice singing in a language I don't know....</P>
<P>Maybe it is the lack of understanding that helps? This is music that feels pretty trite and uninteresting to me when I can understand it (which also induces cynicism for me), so perhaps I need to stop understanding so much!</P>
<P>I'll try the theory with Michele Greene -- Ojo de Tiburon. I don't understand this music either, and it works. Maybe it really does help.</P>
<P>Ok, I'll try that. Stop understanding a bit.</P>
<P>I should probably answer a question now. Let's see if the same lesson can be learned in technology....</P>
<P>Well there is one that Yuhong Bao&nbsp;has been asking rather insistently, like <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/09/13/463962.html#5896652" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/09/13/463962.html#5896652"><STRONG>here</STRONG></A> and via the Contact link and so on:</P>

<P><EM>What is the status of collation support in Access 2007?</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>That one's easy -- the same as every prior 32-bit version with that Windows 2000 post-Beta 1, pre-Beta 2 snapshot that the blog post <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/09/13/463962.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/09/13/463962.html"><STRONG>Extending collation support in SQL Server and Jet, Part 0 (HISTORY)</STRONG></A> talks about.</P>
<P>No change yet, even in the latest version (Access 2007). </P>
<P>Though they did add support for complex data. From GPM Erik:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><EM><FONT face="times new roman,times">The primary feature we added to the new Access engine is support for “complex data”.&nbsp; Complex data really isn’t so complex – it is simply a join in relational terms, or a repeating region in XML terms.&nbsp; What it brings to Access is full schema compatibility with Windows SharePoint Services lists.&nbsp; This allows us to take SharePoint list data offline and to provide rich-client UI for SharePoint using Access.<BR><BR>In the application, complex data usually shows up as the ability to select more than one value for a field.&nbsp; For example, imagine an Issues list with a column for “Assigned to:”.&nbsp; In a single table you could only assign an issue to one person, and Access would provide a simple bound drop down list of people to Assign to.&nbsp; With Complex data, you can (still looking at a single table) assign the issue to several people at the same time, and Access provides a drop down check list with the ability to select several people.&nbsp; This works just the same way as it does in SharePoint.<BR><BR>Behind the scenes, Access does just the same thing a developer would when building the same functionality.&nbsp; We create a table for the join information and create a many-to-many join (in this example between issues and people).&nbsp; The Access database is fully normalized, and there’s no string manipulation monkey business or anything untoward going on – its just vanilla relational joins.&nbsp; However, from the end-user’s point of view, it is far simpler than building the tables and setting up the relationships herself.&nbsp; And since SharePoint doesn’t support joins, it maps directly with the SharePoint way of doing the same thing.</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Back when I was there we called&nbsp;such things queries. :-)</P>
<P>I'll try again to argue language support enhancements for the next version, but in the meantime that workaround still works any time your OS supports the languages/scripts/characters you want.</P>
<P>For the life of me, I can't understand the tradeoffs here -- I am left dizzy trying to pin them down.</P>
<P>I'm telling you, the problem really is&nbsp;understanding, sometimes. It makes a person cynical....</P>
<P>So what's the fastest way to un-know stuff? Or to find some more innocent, less cynicism-inducing knowledge? :-)</P>

A HIT would be Karin Bergquist of Over The Rhine. Trust me on this one, you won't fine a female whose voice is as instrumental as hers (pun most definately intended).</p></div>

<p>I had an ex-girlfriend I stayed friends with for a bit after who (after she broke up with someone else) was playing Ms. Dion's &quot;Seduces Me&quot; on repeat, semi-continuously. It did not take me long to associate the song not only with the singer (who I don't care too much for in English anyway) but with this guy who kind of screwed her over -- so it was double secret Celine hatred!</p>

<h1>The downside to being anti-social is...</h1>

<P>...the fact that social networks are&nbsp;so weird and unfamiliar.</P>
<P>Well, the idea of someone asking <STRONG>What's up?</STRONG> and asking me not&nbsp;respond with&nbsp;<STRONG>The Sky</STRONG> or <STRONG>A Preposition</STRONG> certainly does take me back to&nbsp;a younger time, when I might have done that. So maybe I used to be social.</P>
<P>Anyway,&nbsp;I have stuck myself into <A class="" href="http://www.linkedin.com/" mce_href="http://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</A> and <A class="" href="http://www.facebook.com/" mce_href="http://www.facebook.com/">facebook</A>&nbsp;recently.</P>
<P>But even though I have done all this, I haven't spent very much time on it, and have really not done much to have a complete profile in any of them. </P>
<P>I have had short bursts of interest in fixing that (usually after seeing someone else doing it), but they peter out quickly.</P>
<P>I find myself impressed by the people who have jumped into one or both of these networks more properly (or at least fully). It just doesn't feel natural to do it, you know?</P>
<P>Yet I can write a blog post like this little time-waster with no problem. </P>
<P>On the other hand, once the post is done then it is over -- and the next one will be about something totally different.</P>
<P>So the blog does not require nearly as much in the way consistency in upkeep....</P>
<P>Perhaps social networks would have more enduring appeal for me&nbsp;if I were more properly socialized? :-)</P>

<p>But, I generally tend to visit and keep an account with any social-networking site that has been referred by some site or blog. It makes me feel that I am not left behind the society (at least when it comes to internet surfing)!</p>

<p>ps. feel free to crosslink on linkedin ;)</p></div>

<p>&quot;The sky, the roof&quot; .. ya few half humourous replies I have used too, not because of lack of interest in socialization, but I felt those too formal and mechanical especially from a familiar face.</p>
<p>And yes, played around with Orkut for a while and gave up (time killer), as I have enough real life socialiazation to bother about virtual socialization. </p>
<p>I guess as the sphere of virtual life increases and real life goes down, social networking sites will find selling too easy</p></div>

<P>If JohnD had asked in the blog's Suggestion Box or as a reply to that post (<A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2004/12/22/329657.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2004/12/22/329657.html"><STRONG>%WINDIR%\system32\kbd*.dll</STRONG></A>) I probably would have seen the question sooner!:-)</P>
<P>Anyway, I have had several of the&nbsp;various DDK/WDK packages installed plus being enlisted in various source code projects at Microsoft, so here are&nbsp;three reliable places to find the file:</P>
<UL>
<LI>If you are internal to Microsoft&nbsp;and work in a source code project that picks up the NT Publics, it can be found at <STRONG>oak\inc\kbd.h</STRONG>.</LI>
<LI>If you have MSKLC 1.3 or 1.4 installed, it can be found in the MSKLC installation directory,&nbsp;at <STRONG>inc\kbd.h</STRONG>.</LI>
<LI>If you install the <A class="" href="http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/devtools/wdk/default.mspx" mce_href="http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/devtools/wdk/default.mspx">Windows Driver Kit</A>, it can be found in the WDK install directory, under <STRONG>inc\api\kbd.h</STRONG> (sample projects using it can be found in the WDK install directory&nbsp;under <STRONG>src\input\layout</STRONG>).</LI></UL>
<P>There are other DDK/WDK type installations that also have it, so in all likelihood if you have one installed some casual spelunking through <STRONG>inc</STRONG> directories might be worth a look.</P>
<P>John had a follow-up question a few days later after he found the file (on his own, via the third bullet point above):</P>

<P><EM><FONT face="times new roman,times">Am I correct in assuming that typedef KbdLayerDescriptor returns a struct tagKbdLayer?</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This is a great time to look at those samples I mention above -- with the exception of conceptual topics, code is always the best documentation, dontcha think? :-)</P>
<P>I must admit that I am always curious about what people are trying to do when they want to call a keyboard layout DLL directly. It has come up probably about 15 times over the last five years, in all but one case it was not really what was needed....</P>

<p>Thanks for that, it looks very promising. &nbsp;The reason I want this is that I want to be able to display in my GUI the keystroke combinations needed to generate a particular character. I'm hoping that &nbsp;KbdLayerDescriptor will allow me to do that.</p>
<p>Thanks, Again,</p>

<p>You are, of course, correct. VkKeyScan gives me the information I need. &nbsp; &nbsp; I'd tried VkKeyScan earlier, on a non-&quot;Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator&quot; keyboard and it had not worked, so I had discounted it. In hindsight I should have realized that VkKeyScan would have to call KbdLayerDescriptor to get the job done.</p>
<p>Thanks for pointing me in the right direction.</p>

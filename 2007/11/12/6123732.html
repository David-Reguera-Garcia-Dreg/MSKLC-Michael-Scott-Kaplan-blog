<P>Spam is&nbsp;a problem here, as I have mentioned before, especially from splogs.</P>
<P>(recent examples where I have talked about this before can be found <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/08/19/4457165.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/08/19/4457165.html"><STRONG>here</STRONG></A> and <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/10/19/5519516.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/10/19/5519516.html"><STRONG>here</STRONG></A>)</P>
<P>Thankfully, the blog filters (once I figured out how to set them up correctly!) are catching very close to 100% of the spam with almost no false positives.</P>
<P>In fact the only false positives (valid comments and trackbacks being treated as spam) these days seem to be the ones caused by <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/05/07/2473828.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/05/07/2473828.html"><STRONG>this bug</STRONG></A>. And given that it has its greatest effect on non-anonymous comments (anonymous commenters can edit the title, non-anonymous commenters cannot), the trend appears to most punish registered readers!</P>
<P>Or maybe it punishes blog authors who use curse words in their titles or the introductory words in their posts!</P>
<P>Now as I suggested that I was thinking about in <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/10/02/5237783.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/10/02/5237783.html"><STRONG>Track Update</STRONG></A>, comments are no longer disabled after 90 days.</P>
<P>I was curious what effect (if any) this was having on spam.</P>
<P>The final spam count&nbsp;between midnight Sunday 11 November 2007 and Midnight Monday 12 November is exactly <STRONG>1,321</STRONG>,&nbsp;which is significantly more than it used to be.</P>
<P>I think it is not unreasonable to blame the fact that comments are not disabled after 90 days as the proximate cause. :-(</P>
<P>For now I will keep the settings as they are since the spam filters seem to be so bleeding effective, but I'll be looking at what I can do mitigate the one limitation above and allow myself to curse in titles when it is artistically necessary.... :-)</P>

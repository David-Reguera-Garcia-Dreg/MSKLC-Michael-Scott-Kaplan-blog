<P><EM>A fledgling question here.. I just wonder.. how could one enter these surrogate characters? I did not find mentioned range in the Character Map...</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Well, first a little softball....</P>
<P>By which I mean some gentle chiding that <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/07/27/444101.html"><STRONG>There is no such thing as a surrogate character (dammit!)</STRONG></A>.</P>
<P>I suppose the <STRONG>dammit</STRONG> makes it sound like hardball, sorry about that, Jan. :-)</P>
<P>There are numerous ways to enter them -- from MSKLC keyboards to IMEs to Word's Insert Symbol dialog to Text Services Framework TIPs to copy/paste from web pages.</P>
<P>All of which are (from the user's point of view) is just a single character, a.k.a. a supplementary character (or as young Dean would call it, <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/02/06/525486.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/02/06/525486.html"><STRONG>a surrogateS character</STRONG></A>)....</P>
<P>Not that I wouldn't love an enhanced Character Map at some point.</P>
<P>Though to give a meta-answer to the question, and believe me I hate to get all Jurassic Park on y'all, but I'm simply saying that characters, uh... find a way. If there is one thing the history of evolution has taught us it's that&nbsp;characters will not be contained.&nbsp;Characters break free, expand to new territory, and crash through barriers, painfully, maybe even dangerously.</P>

<p>Something like this?</p>

<p>(ok, missing some of the stuff in the real CharMap, but also with some extras)</p></div>

(softened also by the fact that I had to ensure what the dammit stands for :-D)</p>
<p>Well, I opened the character map only to avoid answer making me feel really silly (as this happens more often than I would like to), and upon openning I thought, this is not going to be here...</p>
<p>So the question should probably be... umm... how to enter these surrogate pairs? Or surrogates character, I like this one as well. :)</p>
<p>You suggested some ways and although I can't make Word's Insert Symbol dialog to do it, after installing Japanese keyboard, I found these in IME Pad. Text Services Framework require a little bit investigation from my side.</p>
<p>Anyway, thank you for good answer to my bad question. I hope it will get better.</p>
<p>Jan</p>
<p>PS. I too would like some changes in the in-box Character Map. It seems to me a little bit forgotten, though not as much as the Add Font dialog. :) </p>
<p>Mihai, add a search feature, this adds the Character Map a lot of usability (although the UI for it is very poor).</p>

<p>Thanks, sounds interesting. But search for what?</p>
<p>And I would like to hear more about any UI improvements idea.</p>
<p>But let's move this on my site :-)</p>
<p>If you want, use the contact page, that will send me an email, and we get in touch directly.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p></div>

<P>I can always rely on a mail from Simon Daniels meaning one of two things:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Something funny that is worth blogging about, or</LI>
<LI>Something incredible that I am instructed I should not blog about.</LI></UL>
<P>Pretty funny in light of <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/10/30/5773071.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/10/30/5773071.html"><STRONG>this post</STRONG></A>, if you ask me. Though on the other hand you probably didn't. :-)</P>
<P>Anyhow....</P>
<P>Everyone involved with Unicode probably has some favorite character that that they want to be encoded.</P>
<P>As I have pointed out before (in both <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/06/14/428797.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/06/14/428797.html"><STRONG>Every character has a story #11: U+???? (The Invisible Letter)</STRONG></A> and <A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/08/13/697002.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/08/13/697002.html"><STRONG>Snakes on an Invisible Plane</STRONG></A>), our general manger Julie Bennett has as her "I wish it could be encoded" character Wonder Woman's&nbsp;Invisible Jet, to go alongside the AIRPLANE that is already there.</P>
<P>So Simon pointed out to me (from over on Engadget) <A class="" href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/11/10/new-helmet-allows-fighter-pilots-to-peer-through-the-jet/" mce_href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/11/10/new-helmet-allows-fighter-pilots-to-peer-through-the-jet/">New helmet allows fighter pilots to peer through the jet</A>, which although not an invisible jet, allows the pilot to see right through their jet. </P>
<P>A valuable first step!</P>

<p>Most of the WW-II aces had excellent eyesight. Chuck Yeager mentions in his autobiography that he'd spot aircraft long before any of his wingmates.</p>
<p>I wonder if it has filters to deal with &quot;they came out of the sun&quot;? &nbsp;I would assume so, but you never assume with the defense industry. And does it superimpose radar and other imagery?</p>
<p>And WTF is up with the super high creepy factor?</p></div>

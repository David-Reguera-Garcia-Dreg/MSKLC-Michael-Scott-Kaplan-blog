<P><FONT color=#ff0000><EM>Nothing technical whatsoever.</EM>&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P>Last night was another night out with Annette, Marla, and Dan.</P>
<P>Though not just any night.</P>
<P>It is [in all likelihood] our last night.</P>
<P>Annette is moving back east, and Marla and Dan, lacking their third roommate, have decided to strike out on their own.</P>
<P>Apparently after the last time we all went out, they came home and kind of hooked up.</P>
<P><EM>Ah to be in one's early to mid 20's....</EM></P>
<P>Anyway, they want to make a go of it, and he is looking at a job offer in San Fransisco.</P>
<P>Annette pretends to be angry at them hooking up bheind her back but tells me&nbsp;she is&nbsp;secretly delighted by the whole thing.</P>
<P>"They have been sliding around each other for half a year now. And Tom Cruise had a point about how <STRONG>Sometimes you just gotta say 'What the fuck.'</STRONG>"</P>
<P>"Fair enough," I tell her, "but Liz Phair had a point to when she sang <STRONG>It's harder to be friends then lovers, and you shouldn't try to mix the two. Cause if you do it and you're still unhappy then you know that the problem is you.</STRONG>"</P>
<P>"You're one to talk, Michael -- didn't you spend your 20's buried in two-point conversions like that?"</P>
<P><EM>I wonder if she made up the use of the "two-point conversion" term or if&nbsp;it is more youngster slang I don't know about; I decide she made it up.</EM></P>
<P>"That isn't how I'd describe it at all, really. But it makes me sound really studly so I guess I can live with it."</P>
<P>Marla looks at me curiously.</P>
<P>"What are you so sad about?" she asks.</P>
<P>I wonder if we're ever going to leave this apartment, inertia seems to be holding us all here.</P>
<P>I decide to go for the safe answer: "Well, the three of you are leaving, so I go back to not having&nbsp;a life!"</P>
<P>"There is that," Dan admits, "though you do have all the music stuff too. Where will we get free tickets now?"</P>
<P>Annette decides to change the subject again. "Maybe we should get really drunk tonight"&nbsp;she suggests.</P>
<P>"As the designated driver," I respond, "I'd have to suggest that I leave the drinking to you youngsters."</P>
<P>A lot of irrelevant banter then happened, and we ended up all getting drunk and never left the freaking apartment.</P>
<P>"We're not taking alcohol when we move,"&nbsp;says Dan,"so we have to drink it tonight."</P>
<P>It may be that we did that, truth be told. </P>
<P>Marla and Dan are all over each other. Boy it changes the dynamic of&nbsp;a group when half the group is dating each other!</P>
<P>On the way out, Annette gives me a big hug and suggests that I leave myself a bit more open to possibilities around me. I tell her she is just wasted and hug her back. She smiles and I can tell she is wondering if I'll ever grow up.</P>
<P>I hope not.</P>
<P>I stumble (well, the scooter equivalent of a stumble)&nbsp;home around 1:30am or so. I am way too old for this kind of thing, maybe it's just as well that I can go back to being old again.</P>
<P>As I read this post I have just written&nbsp;with the start of a hangover that I have decided to embrace rather than offset, I realize that most of the night we were actually laughing yet I only seem to have collected the unhappy (or at least non-laughing) moments.</P>
<P>I don't want to change it now, but take my word for it when I say that it was not the wake that I made it sound like; it was a party.</P>
<P>The end of an era.</P>
<P><STRONG>Life in General</STRONG> is playing, and <EM>Change</EM> just came on. How apropos:</P>

<p>But congrats for being better than that. :-)</p>

<p>Of course the Liz Phair song fits more with my cynical interior....</p>

<P>Not every experience at Microsoft is a great one from an internationalization standpoint.</P>
<P>Like the other day when I was running a commonly used internal tool and was greeted with the following error message:</P>
<P><IMG height=126 src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/provincial01.png" width=1083></P>
<P>Now this did not bother me too much at first.</P>
<P>Because I know my settings are pretty freaking random.</P>
<P>(And also, because the site worked anyway when I ignored the error)</P>
<P>In fact I have no idea what my settings are from day to day -- unless I remember the last bug I have had to take a look at (since that is usually the source of the settings!).</P>
<P>And since these bugs are almost never mine I am simply trying to repro them to find the person who ought to be looking at the problem (if there is one, I mean).</P>
<P>So anyway, judging no one and nothing, I decided to look and see what the settings were in IE at that moment that were breaking this managed application (yes, it is a managed app):</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/provincial02.png"></P>
<P>Now I remember the bug I was looking at, and I admit that these would not be the most common settings one might have, but why on earth should THESE settings deserve that mondo error message?</P>
<P>So I decided to try changing the settings to another language, like Tamil.</P>
<P>Same error message, and then the application failed, too (here is a clipped version of what popped up in the browser with Tamil settings&nbsp;-- clipped to avoid revealing what the application is):</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/provincial03.png"></P>
<P>There are no words.</P>
<P>Someone reported that the application was requiring en-us settings, so rather than fixing the problem, someone else took the time to add this crappy&nbsp;warning, instead.</P>
<P>We have to do better here, as a company.&nbsp;A process&nbsp;that needs to start from within....</P>

Obviously on a for-public-consumption tool that'd be bad, but when you know your audience, it's not such a big deal, don't you think?</p>
<p>(Unless I'm wrong about my 99% assumption, of course...)</p>

<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 18 Nov 2007 6:23 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Well, remembering that, at least in IE, regional options and default user locale control the setting -- and almost no one outside of the US would be likely to have US date format expectations....</p>
<p>Makes this a bit worse in my book. :-(</p>

<p><strong>Dean Harding</strong> on 18 Nov 2007 6:41 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Ah, that's true. Actually, when I first saw your post, I didn't get the whole image so I didn't see the &quot;String was not recognised as a valid DateTime&quot; error (Don't know what happened there...)</p>

<p>try the Visual Basic editor within Office for a world of pain.</p>

<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 19 Nov 2007 9:48 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Of course that is just the world of a non-Unicode app -- but they are able to deal with things once the code page is set right (via AppLocale or via the default system codepage).</p>
<p>Imagine if it would only be English though -- if Japanese never worked. Ick!</p>

<p><strong>Jeroen Ruigrok van der Werven</strong> on 20 Nov 2007 5:30 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Heh, I know what you mean. On my standard XP install I always use NL, EN, CH, JP and KO.</p>
<p>For all my users I install the complete fonts from XP (that asian and whatever option at install time) as well as the Office Unicode/international fonts. With today's hard disk space a few MB for additional language support never hurts.</p>
<p>And Adobe Reader gets installed with the font packs as well.</p>
<p>I just wish such things were becoming more default in applications.</p></div>

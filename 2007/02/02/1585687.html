<P>Kevin asks:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT face="times new roman,times" size=2>
<P><EM>Oh might guru, might you offer sage advice to a humble servant?<BR><BR>I've recently enabled the language bar in Vista so I could enter some Chinese characters to do some intl testing. It worked great, except for one problem - I can't seem to disable the language switch hotkey (ctrl-space, not so good for a Visual Studio developer). I tried editing the Key Sequence on all the Advanced Key Settings actions to uncheck the Enable Key Sequence checkbox for each. That worked for all of them except the last - Chinese (Simplified) IME - Ime/NonIme Toggle. When I try to disable that key sequence, it lets me clear the checkbox, but when I hit Apply or OK, bingo it's back to being enabled again. Help! </EM></P></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The dialog Kevin is referring to is this one in the Text Services and Input Languages dialog, in the Advanced Key Settings tab:</P>
<P><IMG height=511 src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/VistaLangbar.png" width=437></P>
<P>And Kevin is right -- that setting will simply not stick when you try to make no key sequence work -- it will always switch back to this one.</P>
<P>Definitely a bug.</P>
<P>The way it hits Kevin is almost a VS version of <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/03/15/552031.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/03/15/552031.html">this bug</A></STRONG>, but not quite. :-)</P>
<P>Not sure how sage that was (or this next part will be, for that matter!), but the only workaround I found was assigning some other less annoying key sequence that you'd be less likely to press....</P>

<p>Well, not stupid anyway. ;)</p>
<p>I swear I had problems even changing the keystroke to something more obscure (and I ended up removing the chinese language option because of it). But now I added it back in, and keyboard hotkey switching doesn't seem to work at all (I have to use the tray applet). *Sigh* Well, that's better than always using ctrl-space anyway.</p></div>

<p>It's kind of a shame really, I was starting to get into the shell enhancements they made for Vista. &nbsp;Maybe I'll switch back when and if I see that there's an official fix for this.</p>
<p>This &quot;solution&quot; also points out that this must be a bug in explorer.exe, or in its interaction with the language system (such as where explorer.exe keeps its keyboard hooks).</p></div>

I was trying to change the Keyboard Shortcut for the magnifier tool to the more familiar Ctrl-Space, when the Language Bar switched to Chinese Traditional Taiwan.</p>
<p>So I unchecked Enable Key Sequence and changed the shortcut to something obscure, like Shift-LeftAlt-F12. It seemed to work for a while, but whenever I went back to Flash the same thing happened. So I felt I had no choice but to remove the Chinese language packs, but IT STILL SWITCHED TO CHINESE.</p>
<p>After trying to figure out what happened, I realized that Ctrl-Space only switched to Chinese on applications that were already open, but (finally) didn't work when I opened new applications or restarted the existing ones. Very strange behavior, indeed.</p></div>

<p>I also, went into the keyboard controls and removed Chinese from my language list to no avail. &nbsp;I'm grateful that many of you tried very complex solutions, because that's what I would have done next. &nbsp;But your frustrations caused me to try &quot;dum dum school&quot; stuff instead. &nbsp;I ended up going back into the Regional Language section and pretended to add a keyboard. &nbsp;I then expanded every Chinese option on the menu and expanding every &quot;Keyboard&quot; and every &quot;other&quot;. &nbsp;In a couple of instances the &quot;Drawing pad [32-bit only]&quot; option was checked (even though I'm running Vista-64. &nbsp;I unchecked the drawing pad boxes wherever I found them to be checked, clicked OK and so far, so good. &nbsp; </p>

<p>I have another workaround (or so it seems). It's a bit brutal but I was pretty annoyed and tired.</p>
<p>In HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Input Method\Hot Keys</p>
<p>I deleted every key except 00...010, 11 and 12. These were the ones that were documented in the MSDN (the 13 SHOULD be Ctrl-Space but I didn't have it).</p>

<p>Rebooted and the problem seems to have gone away. I can still Alt-Shift to switch languages and Shift to switch between chinese/roman input.</p>
<p>Very strange behaviour, how come this is still around?!</p>

<p><strong>Goro</strong> on 19 Jul 2010 3:13 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>I am having the same problem. Unfortunately, I have no permission to change registry settings. My workaround is to first change the key sequence like Lester did, then select JP or KO from the left most button on the language bar. Then select Microsoft IME 2007 in the second button from the left. If you select JP, then also select Half-width Alphanumeric in the third button from the left. If you select KO, toggle the third button from the left to &#39;A&#39;. So far either JP or KO worked. But I need to redo the above setting once in a while.</p>

<p><strong>Jason</strong> on 23 Aug 2010 1:29 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>I was able to restore ctrl-space using the instructions here: &nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://xahlee.org/emacs/emacs_mswin.html">xahlee.org/.../emacs_mswin.html</a></p>
<p>You can disable the Windows shortcut that switches you among input methods of different languages. Here&#39;s the exact instruction for Windows Vista. Other Windows version should be similiar. Go to “Start‣Control Panel”. Choose Classic View on the left. Then, double click on the “Regional and Language Options” icon, then go to “Keyboards and Languages” tab, click on “Change Keyboards...”. Then, go to “Advanced Key Settings” tab, then, it should list Key sequences on the right column. Select a input choice that has shortcut key, then click the button “Change Key Sequence”.</p>

<p><strong>Rob</strong> on 4 Oct 2010 8:23 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>I&#39;ve tried everyone&#39;s suggestions here.. I&#39;ve been back to this site many times without any luck until now. My problem was that the Android development toolkit for Eclipse was dynamically adding two variations of Chinese to my language settings every time it started the emulator. I suspect that if languages are dynamically added with little care, then their default keyboard combination for switching is ctrl-space. I tried changing them, like others have suggested, and of course that has no effect.</p>
<p>With a variation of Kyl and Talaf&#39;s suggestions, I went into the registry and played around with the hotkey settings. If I removed the &quot;Hot Key&quot; registry key 00000070 (it had the Key Modifier of 02c0 and Virtual Key of 20), then ctrl-space didn&#39;t work for ANY program. But if I go in there and change the key modifier to a less annoying combination, it works. &nbsp;I set my key modifier to be 04c0 and virtual key of 20, which apparently matches up with shift-space. &nbsp;I may end up changing it again until I get alt+shift+space. &nbsp;I haven&#39;t figured out the bitmask for alt, but I suspect that it&#39;s either 01 or 08, which would mean that alt+shift would be either 12 or 09 as a registry value.</p>

Regardless of whether I disable the Chinese language altogether, or change a different key sequence, this annoying ctrl space thing just reverts itself. what a ***.</p>
<p>I regularly use ctrl space for my winamp global hotkeys, so it&#39;s not uncommon for me to hit that set of keys then realize that I can&#39;t use it because now my computer wants to type in Chinese. &gt;_&gt;</p>

<p><strong>Celicasx</strong> on 23 May 2012 5:07 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>I have just had a MS support case logged regarding this issue.</p>
<p>They acknowledge there is a problem with the &quot;Change Key Sequence&quot; / &quot;Enable Key Sequence&quot; tickbox not taking effect.</p>
<p>Their advice in my situation was to alter the registry in the following fashion.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Input Method\Hot Keys\00000010 &nbsp; -- This is for Simplified Chinese </p>
<p>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Input Method\Hot Keys\00000070 &nbsp; -- This is for Traditional Chinese</p>
<p>Current Value is:</p>
<p>Key Modifiers 02 c0 00 00</p>
<p>Virtual Key 20 00 00 00</p>
<p>Please change all to 00 00 00 00 </p>
<p>Logoff and login again.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>After attempting this, my Windows 7 machine was now behaving itself and not switching to Chinese language when i would press Ctrl + Space.</p>

<p>So still a bug but not realy a problem anymore as it no longer survives the reboot.</p>

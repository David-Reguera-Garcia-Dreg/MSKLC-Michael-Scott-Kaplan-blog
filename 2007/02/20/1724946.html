<h1>Dumb quotes... or maybe they are just smart-ass quotes</h1>

<p><em>(I think I mentioned&nbsp;'Smart Quotes' previously, </em><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/12/23/1354366.html"><strong><em>in passing</em></strong></a><em>)&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>If I had a dime for every time someone who was having trouble getting the Regional and Language Options unattend setting to work who posted as the command line they were running something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-family: Consolas,Lucida Console,Courier New,Courier;">control intl.cpl,, /f:&rdquo;filename.txt&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then I'd have to worry about the tax bracket I was going to be put into....</p>
<p>In case you can't see the problem, it is pretty obvious if you blow up the text some:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-family: Consolas; font-size: large;">control intl.cpl,, /f:&rdquo;filename.txt&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At some point the person was looking at instructions in documentation or in email written by a copy of Outlook that has Word set as its mail editor.</p>
<p>It replaced the regular ASCII quotes with so-called "smart" quotes, which can turn <strong>"</strong> (U+0022, a.k.a. QUOTATION MARK) into something else such as&nbsp;<strong>&rdquo;</strong> (U+201d, a.k.a. RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK). Which of course the command prompt will not recognize.</p>
<p>Man I hate that feature. Not because it is isn't useful, because it can be. But it is not quite smart enough of a feature to know when it isn't helpful!</p>
<p>Anyway, colleague Gwyneth Marshall provided me with as list that some version of Office uses for quotes used in different languages:</p>

<p>Now if only Office 14/Word 14 can be made smart enough to detect the cases where the feature is not needed, it could save everyone a lot of grief!</p>

<p>Just recently I answered a question on the WiX mailing list in which I posted a command line. The Word email editor autocorrected my hyphens (to indicate a command line switch) to en-dashes. The original poster replied saying it wasn't working. Thankfully they posted the command-line output - where it was clear that the en-dashes had been replaced by question marks (and the error message was something like 'cannot find file ?ext').</p>

<p>Easy. Quotes must be left “as is” inside &lt;code&gt;, &lt;kbd&gt; and &lt;samp&gt; elements. And maybe also &lt;pre&gt;. In Word, this maps to predefined “HTML Code”, “HTML Keyboard”, “HTML Sample” and “HTML Preformatted” styles. Marking up samples and code as such is then responsibility of authors.</p>

<p>And I think ,O’ U+201A + U+2019 never existed either, since Dutch only recently started using single quotation marks under the influence of American typography (IIRC). So I believe this is a hypercorrect form of ‘O’ U+2018 + U+2019, under the influence of „O” U+201E + U+201D, which itself has become extinct under the weight of American typographical conventions (such as these „smart” quotes and IJ „autocorrecting” to Ij).</p>

<p>,O‘ is never used</p>
<p>„O“ is wrong, should be „O”</p>
<p>‹ O › is never used</p>
<p>&#171; O &#187; should be &#171;O&#187; (used when nested quotes are required, , i.e. „blah &#171;blah&#187; blah”)</p>
<p>I find strange the &quot;some version of Office&quot; statement, since AFAIK the autocorrect feature of MS Office always uses the correct official quotes (99 down / 99 up) since long time ago, even before the recent (2003) Romanian Academy clarification.</p>
<p>Some further references:</p>
<p>The shape (not the codes !) of the Romanian quotes have been clarified (not changed !) in 2003.</p>
<p>The official reference is this (scannd documents; intro + decision):</p>

<p>Additionally, some sort of tutorial on this subject can be found at the Romanain Academy's official site, on the very first page, under a link that says &quot;Punctuaţia limbii rom&#226;ne. I. Ghilimelele&quot; (or direct link <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.academiaromana.ro/com2006/doc/ghilimele.doc">http://www.academiaromana.ro/com2006/doc/ghilimele.doc</a> )</p>
<p>The Romanian translation for &quot;quotes&quot; is &quot;ghilimele&quot;. They are described as 99 down (on opening) / 99 up (on closing). The Unicode correspondence for this description is U+201E / U+201D.</p>

<p>Well, it was *almost* because I don't save the messages I submit.</p>
<p>So after submitting the first and did not make it, I had no way to resubmit, had to &quot;recreate&quot; it.</p>
<p>The differences where not relevant (in my mind at least :-)</p>
<p>Whatever, it does not matter.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p></div>

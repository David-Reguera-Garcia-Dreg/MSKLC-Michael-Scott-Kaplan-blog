<P>Thai support has been in Windows since at least NT 4.0 (though the first version that did a really good job for it was Windows 2000, if you ask me.</P>
<P>But Lao (a.k.a. Laotian, a.k.a. ລາວ) did not fare as well.</P>
<P>I mean, some collation weights were added so Lao would&nbsp;at least have some weight, unlike some <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/01/18/355210.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/01/18/355210.html">others</A></STRONG>.</P>
<P>But it was about as linguistically meaningful as ASCII order would be for Swedish; maybe it would even less meaningful than that...</P>
<P>Luckily Vista added support for Lao as a locale, so that lack is finally addressed!</P>
<P>Anyway, I was out with some friends last night and the song Lola was playing, and I was thinking about King of the Hill and that very first exposure to a Laotian family, as it occurred to me that the culture/locale name for Lao was indeed lo-LA. And perhaps it was because I had a few drinks but the following lyrics popped into my head. Apologies to Ray Davies, of course!</P>

<P>Now I know some it is a bit out of order with the episode and there is something wrong with the scansion, too. But I am posting it as it came to me, hopefully someone will notice that Peggy even had her own little snowclone, which was silly not only because of its snowclone-edness but also because of course the Souphanousinphone are Laotian, not Chinese.</P>
<P>Apologies for the diversion from meaningful blog posts! :-)</P>

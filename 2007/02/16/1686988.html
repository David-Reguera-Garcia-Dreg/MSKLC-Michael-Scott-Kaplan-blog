<P>Trevor's question:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times"><EM>I heard a rumor that passwords in SQL Server are case insensitive. Is that true? If it is, isn't that a bug?</EM></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P mce_keep="true">When I read Trevor's question I was reminded of that telephone game where you get to see how much the message changes as it goes from person to person.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">Or in this case, from blog to blog?</P>
<P mce_keep="true">The basic problem is that if you are running SQL Server:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<DIV mce_keep="true">on a case-insensitive server</DIV></LI>
<LI>
<DIV mce_keep="true">running with SQL or mixed authentication</DIV></LI></UL>
<P mce_keep="true">that the server will (in addition to hashing the case-sensitive password value you assign) hash an all uppercase version of whatever you set. No exactly same as being case insensitive, but technically close.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">You can read about if you go to blog posts like <A class="" href="http://secretgeek.net/sql2k_2k5.asp" mce_href="http://secretgeek.net/sql2k_2k5.asp">this one</A>.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">Note that they addressed this issue in SQL Server 2005 and no longer do this. </P>
<P mce_keep="true">And also note that if you paid attention to posts of mine like <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/05/11/416293.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/05/11/416293.html">this one</A></STRONG>, then you'd never hit the problem (since your server wouldn't be case insensitive).</P>
<P mce_keep="true">And finally note that if you used only used NT integrated logons (which are more secure anyway) then SQL Server also wouldn't be doing this.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">Summary: if you were doing the right thing, you'd never even notice&nbsp;a problem.... :-)</P>

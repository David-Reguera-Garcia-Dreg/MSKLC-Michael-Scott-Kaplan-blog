<P><EM>(apologies to Sir Paul McCartney for riffing on the B-side to Love Me Do!)</EM></P>
<P>I have talked about pseudo locales in passing previously, in <STRONG><A class="" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/08/16/702877.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2006/08/16/702877.html">Walking off the end of the eighth bit</A></STRONG>. But I never talked about the names of these little built-on beasties that Shawn first mentioned in <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/shawnste/archive/2006/06/27/647915.aspx">Pseudo Locales in Windows Vista Beta 2</A>&nbsp;(qps-ploc, qps-mirr, and qps-asia).</P>
<P>These three locales were not yet another example of Microsoft flouting an international standard; quite the opposite in fact!</P>
<P>If you look at <A class="" href="ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc4646.txt" mce_href="ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc4646.txt">RFC4646 (Tags for Identifying Languages)</A> section 2.2.1.3 (excerpted in part here):</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><EM>The subtags in the range 'qaa' through 'qtz' are reserved for&nbsp;private use in language tags.&nbsp; These subtags correspond to codes reserved by ISO 639-2 for private use.&nbsp; These codes MAY be used for non-registered primary language subtags (instead of using private use subtags following 'x-').</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>It is clear that the <STRONG>qps</STRONG> tag for Microsoft's own "private" pseudo-locales for testing purposes had an entirely standards-based origin.</P>
<P>Of course, not everyone wanted to play by the rules. :-(</P>
<P>Everyone, from the localization/localizability&nbsp;folks inside of Microsoft to <A class="" href="http://www.codeproject.com/books/CustomCultures.asp" mce_href="http://www.codeproject.com/books/CustomCultures.asp">authors like Guy Smith-Ferrier</A> outside of it actually went ahead and used <STRONG>ps-ps</STRONG> as the name for the pseudo-locale. This is bad for two entirely separate reasons:</P>
<OL>
<LI>The name does not follow the rules of the IETF standard that have been established as the best way to represent non-registered,&nbsp;private use tags.</LI>
<LI>The actual subparts of <STRONG>ps-ps</STRONG> actually have defined meanings -- in this case it is suggestive of a "<STRONG>Pashto (Palestinian Authority)</STRONG>" locale, which is itself quite silly since Pashto as a language is not used anywhere in areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority.</LI></OL>
<P>As a company this is the kind of misuse that we are really trying to get away from, which is one of the reasons that the way to&nbsp;make the&nbsp;"official Microsoft" pseudo locale names visible was documented for people who wanted to use them in their own testing.</P>
<P>Thus my plea to all those using <STRONG>ps-PS</STRONG> for their pseudo locale needs -- STOP DOING THAT, PLEASE! There are perfectly acceptable ways to do this that conform to the standards and they represent the direction one ought to be heading in....</P>

<h1>On the etymology of 'Unicode'</h1>

<P>John Cowan's question about Unicode was&nbsp;a deceptively simple one that many people have likely wondered about in the past:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman"><EM>What's the etymology of "Unicode"?&nbsp; Does the prefix represent unity<BR>or uniformity?</EM></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>It is the sort of thing that of course there were many opinions about. Mark Davis (president of Unicode) responded earliest and most amusingly:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman"><EM>Attested as far back as Gaius Plinius Caecilius Tertius, apparently derived from Indo-European *oino-kau-do ("one strike give"), *kau being related to such English words as: hew, haggle, hoe, hag, hay, hack, caudad, caudal, caudate, caudex, coda, codex, codicil, coward, incus. (I like the association with "haggle" myself.)<BR><BR>Mark</EM></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>And Michael Everson responded "Universal".</P>
<P>While Jonathan Rosenne asked more cautiously "wasn't it unification?"</P>
<P>James Opstad volunteered:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman"><EM>Joe Becker came up with the term. I believe he intended it to mean "unified<BR>encoding" but with echoes of "unique", but he can provide further<BR>explication.</EM></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>And Ken Whistler (the cool uncle of Unicode) suggested:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman"><EM>You'll have to ask Joe Becker for what all went into his<BR>thinking about it, but I believe it is and was deliberately<BR>ambiguous. The etymology is "uni-" + "code", with the<BR>intent of "uni-" being to denote "one", and to connote<BR>"unity", "uniformity", and "universality".</EM></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>To which Asmus Freytag added:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman"><EM>as well as "unified" and "unique". Unified as in han-unification, for <BR>example, and unique as in the ideal of having only one encoding and one <BR>encoded value for each character..</EM></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>There were a few distractions about UNIVAC and a Universal Telegraphic Phrase Book, and&nbsp;the father of Unicode (Joe Becker) responded rather quickly with the official answer, quoting a very old communication:</P>

<P>... based on my recollection, from the ancient "Starving Students Handbook", of:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Perfect Meatloaf Recipe<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Serve the meatloaf<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Ask your guests what they think is in it<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Agree with anything they say</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Nuff said? :-)</P>
<P>I will have to remember that meatloaf recipe, it reminds me in reverse about a serving of rattlesnake a few years back (a story for another day, perhaps)....</P>

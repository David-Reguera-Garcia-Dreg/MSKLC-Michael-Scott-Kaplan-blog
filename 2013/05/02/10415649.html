<p>In a recent blog, I did a huge disservice to a colleague, and I wanted to set the record straight.</p>
<p>It was back on February 16th, 2005 at 4:55am that I blogged <strong><a title="LOCALE_SABBREVLANGNAME is so not an ISO-639 code" href="../../../2005/02/17/375235.html">LOCALE_SABBREVLANGNAME is so not an ISO-639 code</a></strong>.</p>
<p>And it was over a year later, on September 27, 2006 at 3:01am that I blogged <strong><a title="LOCALE_SABBREVLANGNAME is more than just an ISO-639 code" href="../../../2006/09/27/773341.html">LOCALE_SABBREVLANGNAME is more than just an ISO-639 code</a></strong>.</p>
<p>And then, it was just six years later that Andrew Glass's Windows 8 Language Profile work, and its Windows keyboard list replaced Cicero's older&nbsp;admittedly buggy one:</p>
<p><img src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/2273.kbdlist.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>And although it is truth, it is hardly the whole truth, because it focuses on the past, to the exclusion of the future, and in doing so, it does a huge disservice to the readers of the blog and of the Blog.</p>
<p>All I can do is sincerely apologize to Andrew Glass and the other developers, testers, and program managers of the new Language Profile user interface.</p>
<p>I'm truly&nbsp;sorry, Andrew,</p>
<p>You deserved a better messenger that day then I, because it intentionally lacked the vision that Andrew showed, and that undermines any good the Blog can do.</p>
<p>It makes me wonder if I should take a break from blogging until I know I can do a more honest job then I did that day....</p>
<p>And beyond that, take a step back from NLS as a&nbsp;whole, while I sort it all out for the future....</p>

<p>&quot;You deserved a better messenger that day ---than--- I. . . &quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Kaplan normally doesn&#39;t make those mistakes.</p>

<p>The Unicode Consortium's Unicode Technical Committee released version 6.3 of The Unicode Standard.

<p>And not to toot our own horn, it's [pretty much all] about us, and [a little bit] about me!

<p>Allow me to explain.

<p>Perhaps I am getting ahead of myself.

<p>You might be unfamiliar with <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/">UAX #9: Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm</a> and how complicated it has become over the years.

<p>Or maybe you've been following it for years, because you own your company's implementation of it in a product you're shipping.

<p>For many years, the UBA had been pretty stable, with just minor tweaks.

<p>But I had an idea about brackets and how we could improve the handling of them.

<p>The effort grew beyond what I could do on my own; we needed developers and testers to change the the very fabric of our support. 

<p>Gilead was very encouraging, and we started trying out tweaks in.Uniscribe and DWrite and Internet Explorer. 

<p>Nobody was sure this was going to happen, but everyone was hopeful.

<p>Microsoft Word was already doing this work and nobody knew. So was Outlook. But it improved the confidence everyone had.

<p>So we submitted a change request to the UBA, as an optional enhancement to improve bracket handling in Bidi scenarios. &#128527;;-)

<p>It was tweaked by the Bidi experts in Unicode, and five new control characters were added to help improve things.

<p>And the most significant change to the UBA in years was now something everyone could use!

<p>Many of the situations that would once have led to bugs were now being handled properly. Automatically.

<p>Most of the real work was done by others; all I can take credit for was for having a <strike>good</strike>great idea and convincing a bunch of other people it was worth doing.

<p>Influence without authority? Program Management at its best!

<p>And in end, it is summed up in <a href="../../../../../../blog.unicode.org/2013/09/announcing-unicode-standard-version-6340aa.html?m=1">Announcing The Unicode Standard, Version 6.3</a>. And it was an honor to be a small part of it....

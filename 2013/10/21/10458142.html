<h1>The non-intuitive nature of dead keys that I first noted back in 2004 comes back to haunt us all...</h1>

<p>Through all of the brave talk about chained dead keys that has been going on, one question has been left unanswered.

<p>It is around one of those times when Apple got it right in the early days, and Microsoft as it happens got it wrong.

<p>When you are typing the diacritic piece of the dead key, Apple let the uncommitted character appear as an amorphous chunk, while Microsoft showed nothing.

<p>And it has always been this way, despite how unintuitive the behavior appears to the user.

<p>Not to mention how much harder it is for keyboards like the US International keyboard layout.

<p>This was true even before chained dead keys became a reality with the Cherokee phonetic keyboard layout.

<p>i have been assured many times by native Cherokee informants that the layout's behavior is completely intuitive to the user.

<p>Perhaps informants and native speakers of Indic languages or Korean would feel the same way if appropriate layouts could be given to them.

<p>However, it is less clear whether behavior of Fidel script languages like Amharic, Tigrinya, or Ge'ez was involved.

<p>I have been told that I am almost certainly not going to ever see this behavior change irregardless of how desirable the result might be, so I shouldn't even bother to ask for the change.

<p>And I believe what I have been told here.

<p>I am resigned to wondering whether knowledge gained from the Cherokee Phonetic layout could be used to subtly improve the US International layout.

<p><i>And <b>yes</b>, I have asked for this very change many times since I first noticed the behavior back in the middle of 1996.</i>

<p>You are welcome to start a petition up on whitehouse.gov if you think it might help; I'll vote for it!

<p>For the foreseeable future, however, this is the behavior we will be required to live with... 

<p><b><i><font color=red>Though in all seriousness, PLEASE let me know if you start that petition; I will not only vote for it, I will also blog about it encouraging others to do the same!</font></i></b>

<p>Looks like my multi-keystroke Indic keyboard will have to be implemented in Google IME.</p>

<p><strong>Brendan Elliott</strong> on 24 Oct 2013 1:21 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Yeah, moving more languages to be IMEs seems like the obvious way to fix it within the existing input framework. Put the dead char in a composition, update it in-place on the next key press. Don&#39;t even need candidate UI at that point for most languages and it would probably end up quite similar in design to the Korean IME&#39;s Hangul input.</p>

<p><strong>Doug Ewell</strong> on 24 Oct 2013 7:42 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>I like Azarien&#39;s idea of an &quot;IME-lite.&quot; The existing model seems to divide scripts into the really simple, sticking an accent on top of an &#39;a&#39;, and the really complex, visually picking one Han character out of dozens of candidates. Something in-between is needed.</p>

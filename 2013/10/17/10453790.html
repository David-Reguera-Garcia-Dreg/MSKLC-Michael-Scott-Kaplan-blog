<p>The industry must always be moving forward.

<p>IPv4 is clearly the past.

<p>Its address space is exhausted, completely.

<p>The future is IPv6, and it is where the industry needs to be going.

<p>Of course it was Aesop who asked in one of his more famous fables: "Who bells the cat?"

<p>But now the question is how do companies do it? How do they get started?

<p>How do they take their knowledge of what the future should be and concretely make plans to make it happen?

<p>Well, keeping in mind that they have to move forward slowly, that they have to take baby steps, perhaps it starts early, in setup.

<p>What if they in some future version offered IPv6 as a choice from the beginning?

<p>They could explain the benefits of doing so, like no CP_OEMCP limitations, right from the start.

<p>And then they can deliver on the promise by opening up the machine name rules completely.

<p>Then they can work with industry partners to make sure they follow this lead in these IPv6-only scenarios, too.

<p>Essentially, they can move forward sooner rather than later.

<p>They have to anyway, right? üòèüòèüòäüòè

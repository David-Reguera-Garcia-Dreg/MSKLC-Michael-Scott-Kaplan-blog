<h1>ECMA added i18n support to ECMAScript, and they finally got it into IE11!</h1>

<p>It was just a few years ago, when IE9 was out there, that I pointed out how <a href="../11/10402136.html">ECMA added i18n support to ECMAScript (just seven years too late!)</a>.

<p>I pointed out that I was cynical about changes being made here.

<p>And it was just a few days ago that friend and colleague Mihai Nita pointed out in a comment to that blog that

<blockquote>
<b><i>
Good news: it is in IE 11 :-)
</i></b>
</blockquote>

<p>I think they are perhaps updating Internet Explorer too often for my tastes, but there is no rule about them sticking to operating system versions, so I guess it does not matter. It just means that they will have to deal with the "Do we have a version 13?" sooner than we will. 😏<i>😏</i>

<p>They <i>are</i> more standards conscious then they used to be, even if they are helping to push standards forward like with the brackets in Bidi work in Unicode 6.3, previously mentioned <a href="../07/10454485.html">here</a>.

<p>We finally got the support we wanted in <strike>Java</strike>ECMAScript, where both client and server can take advantage of the functionality. 😏

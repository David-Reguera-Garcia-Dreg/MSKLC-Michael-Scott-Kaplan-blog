<p>So, today (now technically yesterday!) I finally got to meet and talk to ali eteraz, author of the now inspiring blog <a href="https://medium.com/writers-on-writing/9ce935435d90">The Death of the Urdu Script</a> that I talked about in <a href="../09/10455209.html">It feels good to be the hero of the story, but...</a> earlier this month.

<p>I'm still getting email from friends and colleagues about that blog of his every day asking if I've seen it!

<p>Andrew Glass, John Hudson, and I got to sit down and spend some time talking together.

<p>He still thinks of me as a hero, but finally admits that some other people were involved too!

<p>We spent a lot of time talking about how he could get Nastaliq out into the wider world.

<p>I pointed him to the &quot;Rhymes with Amharic&quot; series of blogs that helped Scott Hanselman years ago with the Fidel script:

<ul>
<li><a href="../../../2007/04/14/2128198.html">Rhymes with Amharic (a.k.a. How about a little breakfast embed, dear?)</a>
<li><a href="../../../2007/04/14/2133650.html">Rhymes with Amharic #2 (a.k.a. Before you embed, you have build something to embed)</a>
<li><a href="../../../2007/04/14/2134278.html">Rhymes with Amharic #3 (a.k.a. Read and write a language w/o even getting out of my [em]bed? Kewl!)</a>
<li><a href="../../../2007/04/14/2137215.html">Rhymes with Amharic #4 (a.k.a. we're all [sub]set so turning out the lights and going to [em]bed!)</a>
<li><a href="../../../2007/04/15/2145619.html">Rhymes with Amharic #5 (a.k.a. [Sub]setting up this code where it can do the most good?)</a>
<li>which pointed to <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/CustomCulturesWinFormsFontEmbeddingCodeWithEthiopianAmharicForVistaAndXP.aspx">this blog</a> by Scott Hanselman.
</ul>

<p>I figured that code (which still works!) might help him display text in down-level machines after he runs the code on his Windows 8  or 8.1 machine containing Urdu Typesetting... &#128527;

<p>He left, energized to take Nastaliq forward, for everyone!

<p><i>And with the pointers to that font subsetting code, I got to be a hero once again!</i>&#128527;&#128527;&#128527;

<p>One of best moments someone in the World-Readiness business can have is when someone really gets it.

<p>They get how important it is to localize something if you want to see it picked up by more people around the world.

<p>And they choose to blog about it!

<p>Like Bernardo Zamora did in the Windows Phone blog, with <a href="http://blogs.windows.com/windows_phone/b/wpdev/archive/2013/06/21/tips-for-localizing-and-monetizing-your-app-for-windows-phone-users.aspx">Tips for localizing and monetizing your app for Windows Phone users</a>.

<p>With all of the data to prove how much wider the reach your App will have if you localize into more languages, and hit more markets, reach more customers.

<p>I love it when the message gets out there, when people have the opportunity to see the benefits of localization in such clear and unambiguous ways.... &#128527;&#128527;&#128527;

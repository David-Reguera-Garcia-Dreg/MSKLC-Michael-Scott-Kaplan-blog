<p>People who are regular readers might remember my blog from the beginning of September <a href="../../09/03/10446022.html">The so long up trigeminal.com domain is going away...</a>.

<p>As I mentioned shortly after that, long time friend and colleague Luke Chung of FMS offered to help rescue my old domain, which he will be doing over the next few months.

<p>A quick shout out to a cool Microsoft technology; we used SkyDrive as the cloud-based technology to transfer the ~25 megabytes of data on the site; I'm only mildly embarrassed to admit that he thought of it first! 😏

<p>Anyway, I was sending him info on picking up the files when he pointed out another website he is working to save, one much more important than my <a href="http://www.trigeminal.com/">trigeminal.com</a> website.

<p>He is now nationally known as the one working to save the <b>*much*</b> more important Healthcare Exchange website supporting ObamaCare, healthcare.gov!

<p>You can check out more of the amazing story at <b>his</b> Blog, here: <a href="http://blog.fmsinc.com/media-coverage-for-changing-the-national-discourse-on-healthcare-gov/">Media Coverage for Changing the National Discourse on Healthcare.gov</a>.

<p>Personally, I am a huge fan of ObamaCare, so I don't mind the [admittedly tenuous] association...

<p>This is true despite the negative overall impact it is having on my insurance coverage. , 😞

<p>I feel humbled to think how my tiny defunct site is being saved by the people saving healthcare.gov, but there you have it! 😏😏😏😏

<p>Have you already written about how Obamacare is having a negative impact on your coverage? If not, sounds like a great topic foranother post. I too am a supporter, but would love to hear more from people who are legitimately affected.</p>

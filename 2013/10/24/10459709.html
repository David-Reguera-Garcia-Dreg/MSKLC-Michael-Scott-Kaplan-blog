<p>Regular readers may recall when I blogged a blog in this Blog titled <a href="../07/10454485.html">Unicode 6.3 just came out, and it's [pretty much all] about us, and [a little bit] about me!</a>.

<p>Well, here at the IUC, Lisa was giving plaques to all the people who were involved with the most significant change to the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm in years, and I wasn't included. 

<b>&#128530;&#128542;</b>
<p>Oops!

<p>Technically, she was right; all I did was have the idea, and help Sergey with the Internet Explorer implementation. I talked to Andrew but I wasn't directly involved with the engagement with Unicode.

<p>So I was just the bit of yeast, nothing more.

<p>But it's a funny thing about yeast, and what happens if you don't include it.

<p><b><big>No bread!</big></b>

<p>No worries. I talked to Andrew Glass, and he will talk to Lisa the UTC chair. And so eventually I will get my plaque.

<p>One can never have enough plaques on the shelf, right?

<p>It can go right next to the Unicode Bulldog Award and the Ship It plaque and the Patent plaque. An honorable place to rest.

<p>Because yes, it was only a little bit about me.

<p>But it was my idea. So it was enough about me for <b>that</b>, at least!

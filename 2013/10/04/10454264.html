<h1>The story of MSKLC</h1>

<p>I would like to tell you a story.

<p>The story of MSKLC.

<p>It is a story told many times and places in the past, though never in full here.until now...
<p>Anyhow...

<p>This story of MSKLC started after 9/11. After the towers fell.

<p>A special agent of the NSA who we had worked with before came to Microsoft, came to our team.

<p>They wanted us to make them many keyboards, some for languages we supported but many for languages we did not.

<p>But these keyboards were not designed for native speakers of the languages or using National standards.

<p>These keyboards were designed for fast and easy transcription.

<p>Back then, keyboards were created by way of difficult and hard to author text files you could never imagine.

<p>Oh wait, you don't have to imagine them -- just open up a .KLC file and you will be able to see just what they look like.

<p>"Um, this might take some time," we said. "Can you give us a list in the order of importance to you so we can prioritize the work?"

<p>"No, none of you are cleared, so we can't. But you can probably watch CNN and figure out what the priority list should be!"

<p>So we built the keyboards. We fixed a few of them up (they were using Arabic compatibility characters when they shouldn't be). But we turned them over with instructions on how to use them.

<p>We knew that we needed a better way to do.this.

<p>We needed an automated way to do it, and a way that didn't even need us to be involved.

<p>And from this effort, this work, this pain, MSKLC was born...

<p>These hands off principles guided all our efforts: no SQM, no user tracking, no way to know if any of the 2 million downloads of MSKLC created one keyboard, or none, or a hundred.

<p>And no way to know if an authored keyboard was installed by one person or a whole community of people.

<p>Ray Ozzie would have been delighted with the complete respect for the privacy of our customers.

<p>We changed an industry. I daresay we changed the world, a little bit.

<p>According to that Special Agent of the NSA, we saved lives.

<p>I find it to be simultaneously a blessing and a curse to feel I might have lived a prominent line in my obituary, you know?

<p>One wonders what we will do next, doesn't one? <font face="Segoe UI Symbol">üòèüòè</font>

<p><strong>Rauli</strong> on 4 Oct 2013 1:32 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>I created a keyboard layout using MSKLC 1.4 on Windows 7 64-bit. When I installed it, my computer started to give the default &quot;ding&quot; sound almost every time I start a program. If I uninstall the keyboard layout, the dinging stops, and it starts again when I install it. Is there anything I could do to make it not do that? It&#39;s been a couple of months and I&#39;ve almost grown used to it, but it is quite annoying. And I really wouldn&#39;t want to go back to the standard layout.</p>

<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 6 Oct 2013 8:37 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Rauli, I don&#39;t know much about your keyboard - could you please tell me more about it?</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Rauli</strong> on 6 Oct 2013 1:01 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>I tried to comment, but nothing seemed to happen. Let&#39;s try again:</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know what is relevant to tell about it. I&#39;ve marked it as being a layout for Finnish. It contains the Latin alphabet in the QWERTY order along with a lot of dead keys for diacritics. There are also some symbols like for example ‚òÜ‚ô°‚ô™‚â§‚â•‚âà‚â†¬≤¬≥, along with some special letters like …¨ é î í ê√æ√û â…Ø. It uses AltGr and AltGr+Shift to access these characters.</p>
<p>When I validate the layout, it says of several characters that they are &quot;not in the default system code page (1252) of the Finnish (Finland) language you specified.&quot;</p>
<p>When I build the package, I don&#39;t actually know what all the files are, but it installs when I start the setup.exe.</p>
<p>After that, it works just fine, except for the ding sounds when I start a program or switch from Japanese IME to my keyboard layout.</p>

<p><strong>John Cowan</strong> on 7 Oct 2013 10:57 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>That warning is essentially normal: it&#39;s just telling you that legacy software may not be able to handle some of the characters you are now able to type. &nbsp;I just ignore it (it comes in two wordings).</p>
<p>As for beeping, there is so much noisemaking software on PCs nowadays, I keep my sound firmly muted unless I am actually listening to audio or video, which isn&#39;t often.</p>

<p><strong>Doug Ewell</strong> on 8 Oct 2013 9:33 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>I have my sound turned on, always use custom keyboards created with MSKLC, and never hear these dings. Can you post your .klc somewhere?</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Doug Ewell</strong> on 10 Oct 2013 1:50 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Rauli, I built and installed your keyboard, and I get the ding only when I press [AltGr+Shift+.], which you&#39;ve defined as a dead key with base code point U+2026 (HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS). There seems to be an upper limit on the value of a dead key, a limit imposed by Windows, not necessarily MSKLC. Check out the two links below for more information. Try rebuilding your keyboard with some other base code point instead of U+2026, and see if you&#39;re still hearing dings.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Rauli</strong> on 10 Oct 2013 11:31 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Thanks for the suggestion. I tried it, but the dinging persisted. On the other hand, I hadn&#39;t yet noticed that dead key didn&#39;t work. At least I know that much more now.</p>
<p>I wonder why it happens only on my machine then.</p>

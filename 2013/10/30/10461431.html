<p>So I got an email from Behnam Esfahbod, one of the people watching my <b>The Story of MSKLC</b> talk at IUC 37.

<blockquote><blockquote>
Hi Michael, 

<p>Good to see you at the conference.

<p>As I told you, I haven't had access to any Windows 8 machine to try out the new Persian Standard keyboard layout that you've added, and I'm wondering if you have ZWNJ mapped on Shift+Space or not, since MSKLC does (or used to) not allow "non-space" characters be put on any level of the Space key.

<p>Also, now that we're talking about ZWNJ and Persian keyboard layouts, I was wondering if you would consider adding ZWNJ on Shift+Space for the Microsoft Persian layout. This is the something I did a while back and published as "Enhanced Microsoft Persian Keyboard", [1] which based on what I hear, has been ver well-received.

<p>Best,
<br>-Behnam

<p>Well, I can always look at loosening up the definition of what is legal for the space character. 

<p>To be honest, we always have good reasons for wanting to keep the rules tight, but every time we change anything the definition gets loosened more.

<p>And ZWNJ is a worthy one to consider.

<p>I will look into it for the future....

<p>Thanks for the great suggestion!! üòèüòè

Now ZWNJ is very troublesome to type, but Shift+Space sounds like a good idea.</p>

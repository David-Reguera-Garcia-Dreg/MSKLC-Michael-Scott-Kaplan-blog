<h1>Could MSKLC build keyboards for other platforms?</h1>

<p>After I did my presentation at the 37th Internationalization and Unicode Conference <b>The Story of MSKLC</b>, Raymond Wainman (who was at the presentation) sent me an email:

<blockquote> 
Hi Michael, 

<p>Thanks for the talk this morning on MSKLC!

<p>Last year I worked on the CLDR Keyboard specification which aimed to create an XML format that could be used to represent keyboard layouts on all platforms. I wrote some tools that imported the various source formats (Windows, OSX, Android and ChromeOS) and converted them to this XML format. These XML keyboards are freely available within CLDR.

<p>Just thought it might be interesting for you if you didn't know about it already :)

<p>Thanks again!<br>
Ray

</blockquote> 

<p>Wow! I had never seriously considered MSKLC building keyboards for other platforms. 

<p>But it seems like Ray is saying that he can take a .KLC file and convert it to the format used by OSX, Android and ChromeOS.

<p>Similarly, it sounds like it can take one of the files from OSX, Android or ChromeOS and make a .KLC file from it.

<p>If all of that is true, then that means there is theoretically a way to make MSKLC an editor for any of these platforms!

<p>I admit there are many things to check out first.

<p>But if this pans out, I may have to ask my manager and LCA about our thoughts about the CLDR, if you know what I mean... <font face="Segoe UI Symbol">üòèüòä</

<p>Some of our App writers had began to provide screen keyboard for &quot;Quick IME&quot; themselves. However because the character ordering (and code page coverage, because some try to support Simplified Chinese as well) is not the same, without a standard character selection sequence, for an IME that heavily relies on character selection, it&#39;s kind of pain to be used.</p>

<p>So impatient Michael, some of us have to get our brains into gear first after sufficient caffeine intake.</p>
<p>Some of the crew at Adobe created a python script at <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/keyboard-layouts">github.com/.../keyboard-layouts</a> to convert from MacOS style .keylayout files to .klc files for MSKLC</p>
<p>Marc Durdin wrote a tool to convert an installed windows keyboard layout to a kmn source file for Keyman Developer</p>
<p>The are a few other scripts floating around that I have occasionally seen.</p>
<p>Internally for our projects we start with Keyman ... convert kmn files to .km2 files</p>
<p>Then use the xml representation of the Keyman virtual keyboard to create a simplified layout, and are working on xslt files to convert to .klc, .keylayout, xkb files and layouts for other input frameworks.</p>
<p>At least that is the plan.</p>

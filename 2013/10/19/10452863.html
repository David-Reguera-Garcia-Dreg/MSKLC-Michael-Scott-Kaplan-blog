<p><font color=red><i>Today is Saturday, right? Let's go a little off topic, to my favorite off topic topic!</i></font>

<p>I am going to talk about something that I haven't talked about in a while.</p>
<p><b><big><big><big>Limonata.</b></big></big></big>

<p>I could blame it all on Catherine A. Wissink for introducing me to it. But why be unhappy with the fair maiden Limonata, the most significant of all my significant others?</p>
<p>It is the best and most important drink out there.</p>
<p>The Roman and Greek gods of old would whisper about ambrosia.</p>
<p>But even ambrosia knows it can't hold a candle to Limonata.</p>
<p>It almost took me to Apple a few years back. But Teresa keeps me stocked up on Limonata, so I can keep it in my refrigerator in building 86.</p>
<p><em>She knows not only the store it's in (Costco) but which Costco has it, making her my enabler!</em></p>
<p>It works well ice cold, like coca-cola.</p>
<p>But it also works at room temperature, when coca-cola is like cold pancakes with no syrup.</p>
<p>All soft drink style beverages can elicit belches, but there is but one that is lemony good.</p>
<p>Once again, it's Limonata.</p>
<p>I feel obliged to capitalize.it, before I would capitalize.my own name (if it ever came to that.</p>
<p>And why not? I cannot claim to always be worthy of a proper noun for my name, and certainly some ex girlfriends would consider michael Kaplan to be more appropriate.</p>
<p>But calling it limonata just seems worse than wrong; it feels almost sacrilegious.</p>
<p>So here in the holy temple of SiaO (Sorting it all Out), we say the <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shehecheyanu">u◊©◊î◊ó◊ô◊†◊ï</a> (Shehecheyanu) over only one holy nectar: <strong>Limonata</strong>..</p>
<p>Everything else is just a drink.... üòè;-)</p>

<p>Unfortunately I only know one place that sells it here and they stopped selling it recently.</p>

<p>The other day, colleague David noticed:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Hi all,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Does anybody know off-hand if launching Explorer programmatically (using either ShellExecute or ShellExecuteEx) should fail to open a directory containing surrogate pairs?</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">If I first create a directory, say, &ldquo;c:\コンポ𠮷𠮟㐂&ldquo;, and then run&hellip;</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">&nbsp; ShellExecuteW(NULL, L"open", L"explorer", L"c:\\コンポ𠮷𠮟㐂", NULL, SW_SHOWNORMAL);</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Then ShellExecute succeeds and Explorer opens, but it just punts and opens My Documents.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">If I try the above with any other existing path that does not contain surrogates (like &ldquo;c:\test&rdquo; or even &ldquo;C:\コ㐂&rdquo;) then the Explorer opens in the requested directory.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">This occurs on both Win7 and Win8.&nbsp; Is this an expected limitation with surrogate pairs?</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Thanks,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">David</span></p>
<p>He's right, it doesn't find supplementary paths.</p>
<p>I doubt it is actually ShellExecuteW, for what it's worth.</p>
<p>Something to do with the verb syntax, or&nbsp;how NTFS indexes the files, or more likely&nbsp;the way Explorer searches them, maybe?</p>
<p>Depressing that even in Windows 8 such problems exist.</p>
<p>A good bug with surrogate pairs and supplementary caracters, in any case!</p>

I&#39;m sure people are already trying to use emoji to create folder names, and no, I&#39;m not being facetious or sarcastic (for once).</p>
<p>Char in .NET makes it soooo easy to use Unicode transparently, while still getting supplementary characters wrong.</p>

<p><strong>Mike Dimmick</strong> on 13 Feb 2013 5:11 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>In Windows 7, the Folder class&#39;s &#39;open&#39; command is delegated to an IExecuteCommand implementation, CLSID_ExecuteFolder, which is implemented in %SystemRoot%\system32\explorerframe.dll. The folder name is presumably passed through IExecuteCommand::SetParameters, though DelegateExecute is not well documented.</p>
<p>So the likelihood is that the parsing of surrogates goes wrong either in CLSID_ExecuteFolder, or in whatever IPC it uses to communicate with the running instance of Explorer. If navigating to the folder in Explorer itself works, I&#39;d suspect the IPC. Unless, of course, ShellExecuteW isn&#39;t detecting that the item *is* a folder.</p>

<p>I'll tell you a secret -&nbsp; I got glasses before I had a prescription.</p>
<p>That was just me breaking people into the concept of having them, since I knew I was going to need them.</p>
<p>And I'll tell you another secret - I got a cane long before I needed it.</p>
<p>It's just that I was falling during the daytime (the whole multiple scerosis, ICD-9 code 340 thing), and I decided I'd rather people assumed I was a gimp than a drunk.</p>
<p>And I'll tell you&nbsp;one more&nbsp;secret - I got the Independance Technology iBOT 4000 probably&nbsp;almost two years&nbsp;before I really needed it.</p>
<p>Though it's good that I did; soon after I got it, they stopped making them!</p>
<p>Now don't get me wrong here, the iBOT has always been useful.</p>
<p>But a wheelchair that costs USD$26,100 is probably something of a luxury, at first.</p>
<p>Now, post hemi left hip replacement and still not cleared to walk ten feet with a walker unsupervised, I rely on this chair in ways I never imagined I'd have to.</p>
<p>Suddenly having to care in the bathroom stalls comply with ADA guidelines.</p>
<p>Suddenly having to care what side of the toilet the iBOT will go on.</p>
<p>Now,&nbsp;more than&nbsp;two decades after being diagnosed with MS, I am officially handicapped.</p>
<p>When the hell did that happen?</p>
<p>I wonder what happens next....</p>

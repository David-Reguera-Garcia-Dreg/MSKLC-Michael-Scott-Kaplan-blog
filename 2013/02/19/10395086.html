<p>A timely follow-up to <strong><a title="PowerShell ISE (or legacy) will do *everything* (and it's really easy to start!)" href="../15/10393862.html">PowerShell ISE (or legacy) will do *everything* (and it's really easy to start!)</a></strong> and&nbsp;<strong><a title="PowerShell ISE will do *everything* (IF YOU LET IT!)" href="../../01/23/10387424.html">PowerShell ISE will do *everything* (IF YOU LET IT!)</a></strong>....</p>
<p>After all, in that first blog I talked about Internationalization.</p>
<p>And <strong>World-Readiness</strong>.</p>
<p>But all I really went on about was the ISE (<strong>Integrated Scripting Environment</strong>), and how easy it was to get to, no matter how hard <strong>Windows 8</strong> might try to make it.</p>
<p>So where's the <strong>Internationalization</strong>?</p>
<p>Where's the <strong>World-Readiness</strong>?</p>
<p>Well, there is one great thing the ISE brings to the min.</p>
<p>The .NET Framework!</p>
<p>And its namespaces, like&nbsp;<strong>System.Globalization</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>System.Globalization.DateTimeFormatInfo</strong> and <strong>System.Globalization.NumberformatInfo</strong>.</p>
<p>All you have to do is add a <strong>CurrentCulture</strong> or a <strong>CurrentUICulture</strong>, and stir!</p>
<p>Of course, it is important to either</p>
<ul>
<li>know that they have both been set properly (for your cmdlet's scenario) already, or</li>
<li>make sure that you set them properly yourself (for your cmdlet's scenario).</li>
</ul>
<p>So first you have to find out if the environment is set up properly when your cmdlet is called.</p>
<p>If it is not set up properly, then you will have to figure out how to set it up....</p>
<p>I suppose you will have to answer that, based on your cmdlet's&nbsp;scenario!</p>
<p>For example do you need your user interface to be localized?</p>
<p>Just set the <strong>CurrentUICulture</strong>.</p>
<p>And vdo you need to format dates and times and number and currency values?</p>
<p>Just set the <strong>CurrentCulture</strong>.</p>
<p>Do you need to sort lists of items?</p>
<p>Again, just set the <strong>CurrentCulture</strong>.</p>
<p>Easy!</p>
<p>Do you need the two settings to be the same?</p>
<p>Even easier! Just set <span style="font-family: consolas,lucida console,courier new,courier,fixed;"><strong>CurrentCulture = CurrentUICulture</strong></span>!</p>
<p>And is your cmdlet a lower level workhorse that relies oin higher level cmdlets to do the heavy lifttng?</p>
<p>That's easiest! Just <strong>don't set a bleeding thing</strong>, and let the bloody higher level protocols that have all the bleeding answers <em>provide all the bloody&nbsp;answers</em>.</p>
<p>They wanted to, anyway. :-)</p>

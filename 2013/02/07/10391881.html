<p>So how do&nbsp;I feel, years after <a title="The exciting nature of being ordinary" href="../../../2010/10/09/10073622.html"><strong>The exciting nature of being ordinary</strong></a> and <strong><a title="The ordinary nature of being exciting" href="../../../2010/10/16/10076687.html">The ordinary nature of being exciting</a></strong>?</p>
<p>Well, pretty ordinary, all things considered.</p>
<p>The new Premera Blue Cross Health Savings Plan has done and had its way with me.</p>
<p>And now that I have to pay $1000&nbsp;to $3000 in deductible charges of Microsoft's money via a debit card they provide, and that I now have to pay the next $1000 to $3000 of my own money in co-pays, perhaps Microsoft will succeed in transforming the corporate culture at Microsoft from thinking</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>It's All Free!</strong></span></p>
<p>to</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="font-size: large;">It's All Covered!</span></strong></p>
<p>so perhaps Microsoft will succeed in feeling a little more like everyone else in the country when it comes to health care coverage.</p>
<p>And perhaps they will finally get every one of those 100,000 or so full-time employees to start thinking about health care and not letting fraud happen quite as easily or quite as often as they used to let it.</p>
<p>So they win.</p>
<p>Though I'm still going to be making $1000 to $3000 less than I used to.</p>
<p>So I will choose to not neal before Zod (Microsoft) on this one.</p>
<p>Because yes, he was a brilliant military leader who was unappreciated by his people.</p>
<p>But he, like Microsoft, will feel kind of ordinary from here on out.</p>
<p>You win, Microsoft.</p>
<p>But because of the way you won, you have lost something you'll never get back again from me.</p>
<p>Neither my iBot you paid for or the <strong><a title="How to [legally] extort almost USD$170,000 from your company and yet keep your job..." href="../05/10391102.html">almost $170,000 you spent</a></strong> on me will get that back....</p>

<p>The rest of us out here in American-health-care land *don&#39;t* know that it&#39;s all covered. &nbsp;The only assurance we get that our insurance company will cover something is after it&#39;s done and they have paid whatever, in their whim, they decide to pay. &nbsp;The $25,000 surprise should be no surprise at all, but somehow it always is.</p></div>

<p>Seems companies are less interested to choose good medical insurance than it used to be years before...</p>

<h1>Those languages aren't Right-to-Left, they're Bidirectional!!!</h1>

<p>Generally speaking, everyone knows software has bugs.</p>
<p>There is one class of bugs that, while important to fix, won't mislead or cause wrong decisions to be made.</p>
<p>Like this one that just came in:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">I noticed the prices of these apps are listed in reverse order in Windows 2012 Arabic LPK. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">For example the price of World Atlas is listed as $99.1 instead of $1.99.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Is this a known issue?</span></p>
<p><br /><img src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/6518.reversed.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>It's funny how we always call Arabic and Hebrew "Right-to-Left" languages.</p>
<p>They aren't.</p>
<p>They are <strong>Bidirectional</strong>!</p>
<p>Numbers, for example, are expected&nbsp;to be read from left to right in Hebrew and Arabic.</p>
<p>Even when the letters are definitely expected to flow from right to left!</p>
<p>Now of course it's important for them to fix the bug (it's a very recent regression, for what it's worth - and maybe it doesn't always happen anyway).</p>
<p>But no one will misread the amounts.</p>
<p>At most, they will do a double take and put a picture on Tumbler to share with friends.</p>
<p>I don't have&nbsp;a Tumbler account, so I'll just share it with all of you! :-)</p>

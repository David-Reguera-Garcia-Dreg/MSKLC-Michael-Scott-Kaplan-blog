<h1>PowerShell ISE (or legacy) will do *everything* (and it's really easy to start!)</h1>

<p>This is going to be a quick follow-up to <strong><a title="PowerShell ISE will do *everything* (IF YOU LET IT!)" href="../../01/23/10387424.html">PowerShell ISE will do *everything* (IF YOU LET IT!)</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Someone asked me how to use the PowerShell ISE in Windows 8.</p>
<p>Now everything I had done in prior blogs had usually been on Windows 7 or on Server 2008 R2, and I had never even thought about the Windows 8/Server 2012 story.</p>
<p>At the same time as luck would have it, someone at work had asked me to do something similar (I had been resistant since it seemed unneccesary to me at the time).</p>
<p>I figured I'd do a quick blog that could be reused for the other thing, too.</p>
<p>Easy, right?</p>
<p>Well, I have easy steps, right&nbsp;here!</p>
<p>To get the 64-bit legacy PowerShell on 64-bit Windows&nbsp;(or the 32-bit legacy PowerShell on 32-bit Windows), just run:</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: consolas,lucida console,courier new,courier; font-size: large;">%windir%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe</span></strong></p>
<p>To get the 64-bit PowerShell ISE&nbsp;on 64-bit Windows&nbsp;(or the 32-bit PowerShell ISE on 32-bit Windows), just run:</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: consolas,lucida console,courier new,courier; font-size: large;">%windir%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell_ise.exe</span></strong></p>
<p>To get the 32-bit legacy PowerShell on&nbsp;on 64-bit Windows, just run:</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: consolas,lucida console,courier new,courier; font-size: large;">%windir%\Syswow64\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe</span></strong></p>
<p>To get the 32-bit PowerShell ISE on 64 bit Windows, just run:</p>
<p><span style="font-family: consolas,lucida console,courier new,courier; font-size: large;"><strong>%windir%\Syswow64\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell_ise.exe</strong></span></p>
<p>They work&nbsp;for every version of Windows that has PowerShell, in all languages -- programmatically, via Start|Run, via script, anywhere.</p>
<p>You can start it up or send it a cmdlet, whatever. :-)</p>
<p>Problem solved!</p>
<p>Each type of PowerShell has its one flaw, mind you.</p>
<p>The legacy PowerShell is using raster fonts,which should be changed to a TrueType/OpenType font like <strong>Consolas</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/7651.ise17.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>And the ISE is set to use <strong>Lucida Console</strong> by default; it too should be using Consolas in Tools|Options in the ISE:</p>
<p><img src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/8358.ise19.jpg" alt="" />&nbsp; <img src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/0624.ise20.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>And NOW we're done.</p>
<p>Now of course the people asking were mostly&nbsp;talking about doing it through the user interface.</p>
<p>Not an unreasonable request, and I'm not an unreasonable guy.</p>
<p>But it's gonna take some really serious explaining....</p>
<p>So for the full answer including the user interface piece, you will have to wait for Monday's blog! :-)</p>
<p>I&nbsp;suspect that in the end it will come out a bit&nbsp;less cheery than today's blog was....</p>

<p>You must admit they aren&#39;t necessarily intuitive. plus, WHICH PowerShell did they start? (I assume it was the legacy one, using raster fonts!)</p>

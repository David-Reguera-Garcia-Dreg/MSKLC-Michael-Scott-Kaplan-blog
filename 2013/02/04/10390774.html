<p>Now it was November 20th of last year, about the time that Palernmo the Douche was getting me kicked out of nursing hone rehab (more on that another day!), when I was sent a very cool tweet:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/michkap">michkap</a> xkcd is for you today. <a title="http://xkcd.com/1137/" href="http://t.co/VIReI4wx">xkcd.com/1137/</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;I promised myself I'd get into this some day.</p>
<p>As it turns out, today is some day!</p>
<p>The strip:</p>
<p><a href="http://xkcd.com/1137/"><img title="Collaborative editing can quickly become a textual rap battle fought with increasingly convoluted invocations of U+202a to U+202e." src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/rtl.png" alt="LTR" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;I'll admit as an old Unicode guy I've had nightmares not unlike this in the past, where especially these characters:</p>
<p><img style="max-width: 550px;" src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/0247.controls.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></p>
<p>have wreaked havoc in both plausible and implausible ways (sometimes with Freddy Krueger narrating, sometimes with Mark Davis or Asmus Freytag or Ken Whistler!</p>
<p>Thankfully #1, if the real world ever got this crazy, it could never happen, as UAX #9 <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/#Directional_Formatting_Codes">indicates</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">All of these codes are limited to the current paragraph; thus their effects are terminated by a <em>paragraph separator</em>.</span></p>
<p>Whew! It's how I know it's a dream: the <strong>ENTER</strong>&nbsp;key doesn't fix it all... :-)</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks, Hafthor. Sorry it took so long to cover it!</p>

<p>I got mail yesterday from John Hudson and Christopher Hooker about the Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator and Windows 8:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: large;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">I have noticed that the installer programs for the</span></em></span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">Biblical Hebrew keyboards are causing problems in</span></em></span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">Windows 8. They still work, but &nbsp;one must go through</span></em></span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">some rather dire security warnings to complete the </span></em></span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">installation, including one place where the option to </span></em></span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">proceed is hidden. To make this a bit easier, do you </span></em></span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">have a way of signing the app that would remove </span></em></span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">warnings?</span></em></span></p>
<p>I so love it when they put the answer and embed it in the question that way! :-)</p>
<p>Anyone can sign the binaries used in a setup program -- in this case the three that can be signed are:</p>
<ol>
<li>The setup.exe bootstrapper</li>
<li>The Windows Installer MSI file</li>
<li>The keyboard DLLs</li>
</ol>
<p>But MSKLC itself does not get in the signing business -- that's between you and your code signing authority (Verisign, maybe?).</p>
<p>If you want the setup to have a security warning that prominently displays your company name, you can sign the files!</p>
<p>It just tells people where the package is coming from, and if they trust you they'll accept it. :-)</p>

<h1>According to Independance Technology and DEKA, it's my responsibility, but it is *their* fault!</h1>

<p>There was a company.</p>
<p>Some would say a great company.</p>
<p>I wouldn't say that, though.</p>
<p>We'll just say it is a huge company and leave it at that.</p>
<p>The company is <strong>Johnson &amp; Johnson</strong>.</p>
<p>They created a subsidiary to take Dean Kamen's <strong>iBOT Mobility System</strong> and bring it to the world.</p>
<p><strong>Independence Technology</strong> is the subsidiary.</p>
<p>And the <strong>iBOT</strong> changed my life.</p>
<p>It brought balance to a situation robbed of balance years ago by Multiple Sclerosis.</p>
<p>Of course there were some challenges.</p>
<p>Like being considered a Class III assistive device.</p>
<p>The USD$26,100 price tag didn't help, either.</p>
<p>The fact that Medicare, Medicaid, and most private insurance companies didn't consider it to be 'medically necessary' also hindered the iBOT effort.</p>
<p>Current plan record: as of March 2014, Independence Technology will stop supporting the <strong>iBOT Mobility System</strong>.</p>
<p>We all have problems, I guess. :-(</p>
<p>Anyway, the NICAD battery that powers the iBOT is expected to last a year.</p>
<p>That's how long Independence Technology warrants it, and how long DEKA (Dean Kamen's think tank) warrants it.</p>
<p>So last year, when my battery started faulting ten months in, I admit I was relieved to have it replaced free of charge, saving me the $1100 charge&nbsp;for the replacement battery! üòÅ</p>
<p>The faulting battery was a potential fire/explosion hazard, so it is good to get it replaced, for safety reasons, too!</p>
<p>But now we get into trouble.</p>
<p>Because now the new battery (only 6 months in) is faulting.</p>
<p>According to <strong>Independnce Technology</strong>, this is not a warranty repair, even though it faulted just six months into its life.</p>
<p>I will have to pay the $1100 myself to replace the battery.</p>
<p>We'll see if my fight succeeds to make them take responsibility for their errant parts.</p>
<p>My David vs. their Goliath!</p>
<p>Stay tuned....</p>

<p><strong>Pete Baughman</strong> on 11 Feb 2013 11:15 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Usually when something is replaced under warranty, the new part is warranted for the remainder of the original warranty period or X days (30 or 60 or 90), whichever is longer. &nbsp;6 months is a long time, but it&#39;s probably still worth checking. &nbsp;It makes sense in the context of things like Hard Drives, where they may replace your failing drive with a refurbished one, but I can&#39;t imagine they would replace your battery with one that had already been returned by someone else! &nbsp;Still, the policy may still be the same even though it&#39;s logically inconsistent.</p>

<p><strong>Matthew Slyman</strong> on 15 Apr 2013 8:55 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Are you sure there aren&#39;t some cheap Chinese generics out there? I recently got a free &quot;Penesamig&quot; battery shipped with our new hygrometer. Perhaps the Chinese will be so good as to send you a super-sized one of those?</p>
<p>&gt; &quot;The faulting battery was a potential fire/explosion hazard, so it is good to get it replaced, for safety reasons, too!&quot;</p>
<p>OK... I suppose that wasn&#39;t the best idea then... Perhaps you should instead go into business in your spare time making replacement iBOT batteries, or doing iBOT lithium/ gas-turbine conversions? Would Microsoft allow those technologies in the office? No? I wonder how fuel-cell technology is getting on (which could be combined with a built-in water-cooler function!) There has to be a solution! If all else fails, try copying HP&#39;s example over Oracle/IA64! Sue them and force them to carry on supporting the iBOT! After all, this isn&#39;t just a fashion-accessory gadget, right?</p>

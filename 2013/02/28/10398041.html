<p>Back in December, Cheong00 asked in the&nbsp;Suggestion Box:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">I just bought Nokia Lumia 920 and found that it doesn't have built-in Quick IME (also known as Simplified Changjei).</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">It's sad that the IME is not there because I'm used to it and it's been shipped with Traditional Chinese versions of Windows since the days of Win3.X. Do you know if I can get to somewhere.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">If not, maybe you can point me to the tools needed to port an IME to WP8? I don't mind doing that in my free time if I have to. (The touch keyboard layout would be the same as "Cangjie Keyboard"... it would also be great if I can just reuse the layout and just replace the libary of key combinations)</span></p>
<p>Unfortunately, they did cut pretty heavy into the Windows 8 keyboard list when they decided what to enable in Windows Phone 8.</p>
<p>There are several other examples of this, such as the fact that neither <strong>Cherokee</strong> keyboard&nbsp;(Phonetic or Cherokee Nation)&nbsp;made it onto Windows Phone 8.</p>
<p>This is especially unfortunate since there is&nbsp;a <strong>United States (Cherokee)</strong> option in the regional settings, and they shipped what looks like fancy new Cherokee font on Windows Phone 8.</p>
<p>So why did they skip these?</p>
<p>I did change this other setting to get Cherokee months and days, at least!</p>
<p>The closest we get is all the Charmap apps in the App Store, but they are a pain to type with. ;-(</p>
<p>I'll send some mail and see if I can get some oversights corrected in a future release.</p>
<p>And I'll ask about the Quick IME, too!</p>

<p>However, I still think that it&#39;d be great of Microsoft had ship tools in WinPhone SDK that allow me to make my own IME. It&#39;s doesn&#39;t really matter for me even if I&#39;d never ship it to the MarketPlace. I have WinPhone developer account so my Phone is unlocked for my own deployment and I&#39;ll be contented with it.</p>

So no way to type Tibetan or Dzongkha text.</p>
<p>Can we ask MS to add keyboards for Dzongkha (dz-BT) and Tibetan (bo-CN) so we can actually use this script?</p>
<p>I can use Dzongkha, Tibetan, and all other complex script languages on my Nokia old N900 and N9 - so, right now, lack of more support for languages using these scripts in WP8 phones is a step backwards for Nokia phones running WP8.</p>
<p>It would be nice to see a way for users to install fonts, customize the keyboard layout and add custom dictionaries. </p>
<p>Don&#39;t know why keyboard latouts couldn&#39;t be defined in XML files.</p>

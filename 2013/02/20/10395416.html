<p>Prior parts in these series such as <strong><a title="PowerShell ISE will do *everything* (though some assembly may be required!)" href="../19/10395086.html">PowerShell ISE will do *everything* (though some assembly may be required!)</a></strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong><a title="PowerShell ISE (or legacy) will do *everything* (and it's really easy to start!)" href="../15/10393862.html">PowerShell ISE (or legacy) will do *everything* (and it's really easy to start!)</a></strong> and <strong><a title="PowerShell ISE will do *everything* (IF YOU LET IT!)" href="../../01/23/10387424.html">PowerShell ISE will do *everything* (IF YOU LET IT!)</a></strong> all have some things in common.</p>
<p>They are all relevant.</p>
<p>They are all useful.</p>
<p>This fourth part of the series is the veriform appendix, whose only reason for being is masochists who are so sure that Windows 8 is more intuitive that they laugh at those easy shotcuts, certain that the intuitive Windows 8 user interface will make it all easier.</p>
<p>This part is to knock the wind out of their sails a bit....</p>
<p>To start, we'll go back to Windows 7, which was pretty intuitive here:</p>

<p>See how all four options are right on the <strong>Start Menu</strong>?</p>
<p>Windows 8 got rid of that.</p>
<p>So if you search for PowerShell in apps, you do get one relevant hit:</p>
<p><img src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/6320.ise15.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></p>
<p>Unfortunately, it lies when it shows that image.</p>
<p>It launches the legacy PowerShell.</p>
<p><img src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/0654.ise16.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></p>
<p>The one with the default <strong>Raster Fonts</strong> setting that corrupts so well.</p>
<p><img src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/7651.ise17.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></p>
<p>Crap. And other four letter words.</p>
<p>It turns out we have to go to the Control Panel (which means it won't work on ARM, or on the non-Pro Surface.</p>
<p>Sigh. And other four letter words.</p>
<p>At least we can find the <strong>Control Panel</strong>!</p>
<p><img src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/0714.ise11.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></p>
<p>Cool! And other four letter words (not all four letter words are bad!()</p>
<p>We dig into the control panel a bit.</p>
<p><img src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/2112.ise12.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></p>
<p>System and Security? That sounds good.</p>
<p>Let's try it:</p>
<p><img src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/5100.ise13.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></p>
<p>There we go!</p>
<p><strong>Administrative Tools</strong>!</p>
<p>That's where we hid the PowerShell treasures!</p>
<p><img src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/1537.ise14.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></p>
<p>Just pick either <strong>PoweerShell ISE</strong> (try not to pay attention to the missing fourth option on the list -- since you aren't supposed to use it anyway!).</p>
<p>We made it!</p>
<p>To the <strong>Integrated scipting Environment</strong>!</p>
<p><img src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/8640.ise21.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></p>
<p>Of course the ones who used those dreaded easy shortcuts got there days ago!</p>
<p>Plus I doubt your ever would have found it without my bread crumbs! :-)</p>
<hr/><p><strong>metathinker</strong> on 20 Feb 2013 7:47 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Here&#39;s one dreaded easy shortcut:</p>
<p>1. Press the Windows key to go to the Start screen</p>
<p>2. Swipe from right / move mouse to right corner and drag straight down or up</p>
<p>3. Choose Settings</p>
<p>4. Choose Tiles</p>
<p>5. Turn on Show Administrative Tools</p>
<p>Now Powershell ISE will show up on the Start screen, and you can search for it!</p>

<p>Typing &#39;ise&#39; in a powershell prompt opens the powershell ise. Also, anything you type after &#39;powershell&#39; in metro start search will be executed by powershell. So tapping windows key, typing &#39;powershell ise&#39;, and hitting enter will open the powershell ise.</p>

<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 20 Feb 2013 11:13 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>But is it intuitive? :-)</p>

<p><strong>gm2k</strong> on 20 Feb 2013 12:15 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Well, pressing the windows key and typing ISE when I want to launch the ISE seems pretty intuitive to me.</p>

<p><strong>Heath Stewart</strong> on 20 Feb 2013 2:08 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>If you&#39;re an avid PowerShell use (console or ISE), pin PowerShell to your taskbar. After you start it once, right-clicking (or hold on a touch device) will bring up a menu for running as admin, the console, or the ISE programs. I use this almost entirely in place of cmd so while I&#39;m in the desktop Start+&lt;1-based Index of where it&#39;s pined&gt; (ex: Start+2 for me) fires it up.</p>

<p><strong>Joshua</strong> on 22 Feb 2013 9:07 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Windows ARM is as good as dead. The only thing that can save it now is to push out an update that fully unlocks the actual desktop, but Microsoft hasn&#39;t the guts.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Kwpolska</strong> on 23 Feb 2013 12:27 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Control Panel should be available on Windows RT, because it is a stock Windows app, just like Explorer.</p>
<p>@Joshua: apps wonâ€™t run anyways, because they would need to be re-compiled for the ARM instruction set.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Simon Buchan</strong> on 24 Feb 2013 1:54 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>I&#39;m not sure why you&#39;re convinced that powershell.exe is &quot;Broken old crappy powershell&quot; and powershell_ise.exe is &quot;The new hotness awesomesauce powershell!&quot; - while ISE may be more useful for powershell script development, surely you&#39;re running the damn things with powershell.exe, right? I mean the whole point of a scripting language is that you can make scripts with it, and those (at least, the ones you write) are most likely going to be run from some sort of console.</p>
<p>Frankly, it&#39;s not even a particularly bad experience to write powershell in your own editor of choice (I do like Sublime Text a *lot*), pasting in any snippets into a console that you want to test, or using the tab-completion or -? for discoverability - the fact that you don&#39;t get full international output is not great, but so long as it can write it to a file correctly, I&#39;m fine with that.</p>

<p><strong>Joshua</strong> on 24 Feb 2013 6:42 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>@Kwpolska: There are many apps with developers ready and waiting. Most of the stuff that did come across from Unix in the porting will compile for ARM run just fine as a Win32 ANSI application but a rewrite for Metro&#39;s just not going to happen.</p>

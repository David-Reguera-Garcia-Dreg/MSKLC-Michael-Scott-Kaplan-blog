<h1>In search of GetBidiCategory...</h1>

<p>It all started when Pete D. said:
<blockquote>
I know this blog post is ancient, so sorry for the late comment, but...

Where is GetBidiCategory? It's not documented on MSDN in the CharUnicodeInfo class. Alternatively, will CharUnicodeInfo ever have a general purpose &quot;return all categories&quot; method?
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, they never made these methods public.

<p>The only way to get to them is by reflection, as described in this later blog, <a href="../../../2005/09/09/462934.html">Update on the CharUnicodeInfo class</a>, as the testers didn't want to make it public.

<p>I guess that is all explanation we're going to get as any other method.

<p>But something seems missing from the explanation, you know?

<p>In other news, today is my birthday, and I am 43 today. Happy Birthday to me...

<p>I have no public or private knowledge to continue to sell MSFT ESPP stock for TSLA, but I'll keep on recommending it. They are not done yet, by any means. They are at 188.64 now, so anyone who listened to my initial recommendation already made more than USD$26 per share. How long will you wait to make some money here? &#128527;;-)

<p>Consider it my happy birthday present to you, my loyal readers!

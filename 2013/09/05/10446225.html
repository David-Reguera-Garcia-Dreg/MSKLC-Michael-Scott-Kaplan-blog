<h1>Building 86 is now completely accessible!</h1>

<p>So in days past when I talked of other things, like in <a href="../../01/22/10387105.html">The top 10 reasons the people responsible for Building 86 should be glad Jews don't believe there's a Hell</a> and <a href="../../04/11/10410235.html">"My old group? I couldn't really reach them anymore, so I talked to my people and had them 86'd..."</a>, some amazing thing happened.</p>
<p>With the help of an amazing contact Tiffany in HR/Benefits, and at the cost of probably half a million to Facilities, Reasons #09 to #02 were completely handled, and I was able to move back to Building 86.</p>
<p>I did lose my window office in the Partner Solutions Center, but I was pretty much working from home during that time.</p>
<p>It is <strong>really </strong>great to be back with the team in 86, so I could get my job done and see the people who I am working<strong> with and have been working with.</strong></p>
<p>Now in the final bit of irony on the whole situation, it turns out that I may not be able to get the home health care that I wanted, covered by insurance at least.</p>
<p>The reason? Because I am not working from home like I was for most of the time I was in 25/1444, I am n longer eligible.</p>
<p>Perhaps you aren't sure why that would be ironic.</p>
<p>Well, Microsoft is self-pay for health insurance - they just have Premera Blue Cross administer the plan. So the facilities part of Microsoft spending $500,000 kept the insurance part of Microsoft from having to pay.</p>
<p>If you ask me, they could have let me keep working from home and saved the money! üòè;-)</p>
<p>Oh well. Maybe I'll appeal the decision - that *is* how I got the iBOT 4000 four years back.</p>
<p>It worked last time, so what do I have to lose by trying at least?</p>

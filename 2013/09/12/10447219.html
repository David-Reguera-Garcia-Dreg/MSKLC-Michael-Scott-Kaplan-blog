<h1>SRT? Indubitably!</h1>

<p>Recently, I wrote a blog titled <a href="../../08/19/10442592.html">Subtitles - where World-Readiness and Accessibility both make themselves at home</a>, and old friend and colleague Joe Clark pointed out that <b>Captions are not Subtitles</b>.

<p>And I'll tell you something -- he's right. 

<p>In my defense, I need to point out that since the people who do both captions and subtitles use those same .SRT files. So it isn't me that's confusing the two. It's the people providing the content!

<p>You can hardly blame them, you know. It is just such a convenient system, and it works so well for either or both purposes.

<p>There's a simple reason that .SRT files are used here: because they work. All of the movies and television shows, and half of the commercials.

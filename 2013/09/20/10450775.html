<h1>The downsides of a broken Microsoft ID (and the power of the Store!)</h1>

<p>It was a few days ago that I kind of died.
<p>Well not died, but certainly my identity has been kind of seriously wounded.

<p>The first hint of a problem came when my Nokia Lumia 920 had some App updates in the Store. The error that comes back is:

<blockquote><b>
Your user name or password don't seem to be working. Please try to type them in again."
</b></blockquote>

<p>But it fails to recognize the password as being valid.

<p>Microsoft's internal helpdesk does not cover the problem and points to MSN helpdesk at 1 (800) 386-5550.

<p>Calling them points one to Windows support, which it will helpfully transfer you to while pointing out the direct number is 1 (866) 234-6020.


<p>That number, after determining that you need to reset your Live ID (Microsoft ID) will send you to http://account.live.com/password/reset.

<p>I had my ID as v-michka@msn.com with a free account while I was an MVP for Microsoft, using my Microsoft username while I was a vendor, with a backup account of michka@trigeminal.com, which I was recently afraid I was losing due to <a href="../03/10446022.html">this</a> came up, which thankfully is being resolved by Luke Chung of FMS, who will take over the domain and host the old content, letting me keep the original email.

<p>About half of the sites think of me as v-michka@msn.com (now aliased as v-michka@outlook.com!) and half of them think it is michka@trigeminal.com, which holds my Microsoft ID quite nicely.

<p>Ironically, all of my problems are with Microsoft sites, programs, and services; I can ignore most of the problem on my computers and my phone by using non-Microsoft products.

<p>This very blog you are reading is being written on my phone by the <b>Incognito</b> browser from <b>casaro</b>, for example! It's a nice little browser and since it is currently saving my ability to blog I don't mind the endorsement!

<p>No one knows why the problems were happening originally, but once again I find myself in awe of the power of the Store on the Windows Phone and Windows 8 (and 8.1!) which literally saved my ability to blog today! It will definitely be a new topic I will be blogging about and working on in the future!

<p>Well, he did it

<p>Steve Ballmer has said he will be stepping down from the role of CEO of Microsoft within a year.

<p>The stock had its largest one day gain in months upon the announcement.

<p>This probably eased the burden a bit on Mr. Ballmer, since he made money on the deal.

<p>Of course, most of those gains have gone away as people worry about who the next CEO will be...

<p>Who will it be?

<p>Could it be you?

<p>Do you have what it takes to be the next person in charge of Microsoft?

<p>Personally, I am hoping that Bill Gates steps up to do the job.

<p>Speculation is rampant and never ending. And I hardly have a say in the matter.

<p>But it would be a pretty amazing way to re-energize the company once again. And we could use that. We <b>really</b> could use that, you know?

<p>For now, we'll wait and wonder.

<p>I'll keep buying MSFT stock for the maximum allowed each pay period via ESPP and roll it into TSLA. I wasn't smart enough to do at 30, but I was smart enough to do it at 80, and I have been pretty consistent about doing it ever since. Now it is at 183, and I don't think they are done yet. What do you think?

<p>In any case, we still need a Chief Executive Officer. Who do you think it should be?

<p>Sinofsky is gone, Ray Ozzie is gone, Ted Kummert is gone. Richard Maciniff is gone. Tom Casey is gone. Maybe one of them could be coaxed back?

<p>I am still left with Bill Gates as the best possible option..

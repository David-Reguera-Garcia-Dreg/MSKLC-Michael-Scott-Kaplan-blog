<h1>Is there anyone from Facebook reading this Blog?</h1>

<p>I tend to find the different forms of Unicode and the consequences of using them to be fascinating</p>
<p>Like Twitter, which uses UTF-16 for it's tweets, which only punishes users whose names are off the BMP.</p>
<p>Or Facebook, which uses UTF-8, which arbitrarily punishes people depending on their arbitrary position in the code space.</p>
<p>And even texting, which punishes people are on whether they use ASCII text or not.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in <a href="../../04/01/10406100.html">this blog</a> or in GSM standard someone called out in the comments.</p>

<p>One could use UTF-32 and punish everyone equally  but it hardly seems worth the space.
<p>Ah, the intricacies of the UTF forms....</p>
<p>Maybe I should add something new to the mix to make it even more complicated! 😏</p>
<p>Let's add the Nokia Lumia 920 running Windows Phone 8, shall we?</p>
<p>It has a Me Tile that has special powers to make Facebook look foolish, after all.</p>
<p>From that Tile, you add emoticons like <font name=Segoe UI Symbol>😏😍😊😃😆😞😒😔</font>, emoticons that Facebook doesn't currently allow.</p>
<p>The Tile that makes Facebook look wrong! I use it all the time now, because maybe the constant work will push Facebook into doing the right thing.</p>
<p>Nevermind, I'm not that patient. I'll use a blog, THIS blog, to see if I can shake some sense into them...</p>

<p>Now that I think about it, the problem seems to happen most often with the Facebook app provided by Microsoft. So maybe this is our bug, technically?

<p>You might clarify that &quot;punishing people&quot; by using UTF-8 or -16 refers only to message size, not whether characters are actually supported.</p>

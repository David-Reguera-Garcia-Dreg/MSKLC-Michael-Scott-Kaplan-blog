<p>I almost had a chance to be in a big Hollywood movie.
 
 <p>A part the director loved and that I loved performing in, but then 
 
 <p> I just got email from Joanne Pranrsky (he women who got me the gig) which said:
 
 <blockquote>
 
 <p>i am so sorry to tell you that I just learned that it’s ‘the cutting room floor’.   
 editor Don Miloyevich just told me and needless to say, we’re all extremely disappointed.
 
 <p>editor  (Don put it better using the word ‘heartbreaking’.) 
 
 <p> Apparently, the second editor fired the first editor antd didn’t even allow the director into the cutting room, or something like that.  
 
 <p> I guess that’s the way it goes in Hollywood.
 
 <p>I'm so bummed!
 
 <p>Sorry,
 <p>Joanne
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>I know Gavin Hood really liked the scene, so I have high hopes for the director's cut!

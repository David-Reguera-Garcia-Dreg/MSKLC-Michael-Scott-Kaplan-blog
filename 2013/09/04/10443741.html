<h1>Software patents continue to suck, by and large</h1>

<p>I got an email from the Patent group at Microsoft the other day. And for one of those great ideas never fully realized, like last time when I wrote <a href="../../../2010/08/15/10050209.html">Software patents suck</a></p>
<p>This was for another patent, one we probably never should have been getting, titled 'Multiple Input Language Selection'. I only got $500 for this patent, because despite the fact that it was buried in prior art, I didn't have the heart to completely torpedo it, although I dragged my heels in a little bit...</p>
<p>So I will get the patent that should probably never have been granted.</p>
<p>And it will sit on the shelf next to the patent that represents a perfect example reduced to practice though never implemented (and it probably never will be).</p>
<p>I feel cheated somehow.</p>
<p>Perhaps I should have worked a little harder on it when I was developing it? When I was a developer, I mean.</p>
<p>Though being a developer is like being a marine. There are no ex-developer, or ex-marines.</p>
<p>Ironically enough, Google fought that one a little, but I'm sure we'd let them use this one if they wanted to, No hard feelings, after all..</p>
<p>Maybe I should send Mark Davis an email about this after I post this blog just to make sure someone gets something useful out of it! üòè;-)</p>

<h1>Keyboards: hardware vs.software, Redux</h1>

<p>it was over eight years ago that we met with the keyboard hardware folks to talk about the differences between keyboard hardware and software layouts in <a href="../../../2005/01/21/357960.html">this</a> blog.

<p>We promised to stay in touch, but time passes and we lost our connections. 

<p>Until a few weeks ago.

<p>When they started reaching out talking to us about keyboard legends (by which that meant the text printed on the keys).

<p>So we started talking to them.

<p>Now it wasn't the same group of people as we talked to last time.

<p>Basically an entirely different group of people were asking the questions.

<p>The same questions that were asked before about the differences between the two.

<p>Like the broken bar on the key that becomes a solid bar when you type it. Like we discussed <a href="../../../2006/02/24/538496.html">Two guys walked into a bar, but the bar was broken</a> blog.

<p>And the differences between the various Turkish keyboard layouts.

<p>And so on.

<p>I started wondering what would happen if I searched the blog for "Keyboards: Hardware vs. Software" which link would come up first: the link from 2005 9or this link.

<p>At first, it would be the older link.

<p>But over time perhaps the newer link would prove to be more popular, with its direct link to the older post and the only back link buried in the comments.

<p>Who knows where it might all end up?

<p>Does it really make a difference, in the end?

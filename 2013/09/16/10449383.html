<h1>When Archstone got involved with Shearson Lehman is when it went wonky...</h1>

<p>It all started with Shearson Lehman all those ages ago.

<p>They owned Archstone, and got caught up in the subprime mortgage scandal.

<p>The wheels started to come off the wagon when congressional hearings started. 

<p>Then they split the whole Archstone juggernaut in two parts - one with Avalon Bay and the other with Equiom.

<p>They took a huge loss on the sales.

<p>At this point, they just wanted to get out of the situation, at any cost.

<p>The new management wasn't particularly happy about the work. And the fact is the new management is not being very helpful.

<p>I can't tell you how afraid the maintenance staff is about helping me with flat tires and such.

<p>And I can't tell you often the Avalon Bay people blame it on the local maintenance staff, while all the while they put the fear into the same maintenance staff if they try to help.

<p>It all boils down to games in the end. And I don't appreciate their dishonesty here. I prefer a more above board approach here.

<p>Oh well. What do I expect from the people who tried to evict me last year because their website was broken? :-(ðŸ˜ž

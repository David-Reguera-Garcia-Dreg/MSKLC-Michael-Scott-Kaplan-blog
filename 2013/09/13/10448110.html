<p>Now you've heard me talk about IDN (Internationalized Domain Names) and EAI (Email Address Internationalization) before.

<p>With more domains in China and Russia and India and Saudi Arabia and other places throughout the world that are outside of ASCII, the need to support those domains has never been more important.

<p>Perhaps you sensed a disturbance in the force when I did.

<p>But if you were in Redmond, WA on April 26, 2013, you might have heard my head explode.

<p>The announcement in Chinese was at:
<blockquote>
http://www.icoremail.cn/about_trends_info_359.html
</blockquote>
<p>Or translated via Bing (if your Chinese is rusty):
<blockquote>
<p>http://www.microsofttranslator.com/bv.aspx?from=zh-chs&to=en&a=http://www.icoremail.cn/about_trends_info_359.html
</blockquote>

<p>Basically, the announcement was that version 3.0 of Coremail XT (a product with over 600,000 users worldwide) supports EAI, and is the first product that has been announced to the world with that support.

<p>And what does that have to do with the future? For Microsoft?

<p>Maybe nothing.

<p>But the IETF (the Internet Engineering Task Force) and a lot of people and companies are thinking they might be looking at what the next iteration of their products will have to contain to remain competitive....EAI support?

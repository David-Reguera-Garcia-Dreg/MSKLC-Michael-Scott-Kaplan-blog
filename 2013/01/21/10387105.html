<h1>The top 10 reasons the people responsible for Building 86 should be glad Jews don't believe there's a Hell</h1>

<p>Our group moved to Building 86 while I was out breaking my hip late last year.</p>
 <p>This was not a good move.</p>
 <p>So here sits my immediate list of reasons for why I think this....</p>
 <p><strong>Reason #10: I think they actually fired us!</strong></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">I think we were actually fired late last year.</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Some Exec said "Those localizers? Let's 86 'em all!"</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">The vendor given the task (who himself saw his contract being cut short by that same Exec) decided to strategically misunderstand the Exec.</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">And he moved us to Building 86, instead.</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Now, in the true spirit of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0151804/">Office Space</a>, due to a glitch in the payroll system, we are all stil being paid.</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">However, I fully expect them to "fix the glitch" at some point....</p>
 <p>&nbsp;<strong>Reason #09: Wheelchair vans won't pick up from the 86 North Entrance!</strong></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">This is of course the only entrance to the building with lving, breathing receptionists.</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Now it is true that some of the larger Connect vehicles can't fit there comfortably.</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">But the 50*, 63*, and 64* vehicles whose fewer than 10 of the 300 vehicles that make up the ADA approved method of wheelchair vehicles can all fit there comfortably.</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">This is not the fault of the drivers, who clearly know their vehicles.</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">It is, however, the fault of the dispatchers, who clearly do not.</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">The dispatchers require that pickup happen at the 86 West Entrance, which has its own problems that I'll discuss shortly.</p>
 <p><strong>Reason #08: Wheelchair vans won't pick up from the 86 North Entrance, either!</strong></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">For similarly misguided reasons, those Connect dispatchers won't allow ADA approved wheelchair vehicles to drop off there, either.</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">This issue is slightly offset by the drivers, who as I said know what their vehicles can do.</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">I guess the Connect dispatchers need a refresher course!</p>
 <p><strong>Reason #07: The 86 North Entrance has no ADA aproved entry method!</strong></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">There are no buttons to facilitate entry to or exit from the reception area.</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Similarly, there are no buttons to facilitate entry to or exit from the building proper.</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">The door is not&nbsp;uncomfortably heavy (unlike&nbsp;other Safeco buildings like 85!) but it is&nbsp;incredibly awkward to navigate when you are in a wheelchair.</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Especially if you are carrying something, like&nbsp;a lunch tray!</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">During working hours, the receptionist can help by either holding the door open that I hand them, or coming out from the desk and holding the door open.</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">On the bright side, they can at least do that easily enough -- unlike other Safeco buildings like 85!</p>
 <p><strong>Reason #06: The 2nd floor of the 86 North Entrance has no live attendant and no ADA-approved entry/exit method!</strong></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">So, you come into 86 via the North Entrance, say hi to the receptionists, and take the elevator to the 2nd floor.</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Perhaps you are going to the cafeteria.</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Or perhaps you are coming from the 86 cafeteria with your lunch to take back into your office.</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Once agan, the door is not uncomfortably heavy (unlike other Safeco buildings like 85!) but it is incredibly awkward to navigate when you are in a wheelchair.</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Especially if you are carrying something, like a lunch tray!</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">And this time, you have no receptionist to help you. :-(</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">You are left on your own to navigate the door.</p>
 <p><strong>Reason #05: The 86 East Entrance has no live attendant and no ADA appoved entry/exit method!</strong></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Now there&nbsp;<em>are</em> ADA-approved buttons to get into and out of the building.</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">However, there are no such buttons to get into or out of the building proper!</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Clearly, somene wants to make it hard to get to my office on the 1st floor of Building 86!</p>
 <p><strong>Reason #04: The 86&nbsp;West Entrance has no live attendant and no ADA approved entry/exit method! </strong></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">To complete the set, this entrance does indeed have ADA-approved buttons to get into and out of the building.</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">However, there are no such buttons to get into or out of the building proper!</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">During working hours, there are usually people there to help, almost more often than any other case thus far.</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">But as the only door the Connect dispatchers will allow ADA-approved wheelchair shuttles to drop of to or pick up from, the lack is a srious ssue.</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Made even more serious because...</p>
 <p>&nbsp;<strong>Reason #03: The door&nbsp;between the 86 cafeteria and the 2nd floor of 86 has no ADA appoved entry/exit method! </strong></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">So, you make it into Building 86 and you are home free, right?</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Well, almost.</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">You are now in the 86 cafeteria.</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">There is&nbsp;one more door, between the 86 cafeteria and the working portion of&nbsp;Building 86 lacking a live attendant.</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Reasonable for such an "internal" door.</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Not so reasonable is the lack of an ADA-approved entry or exit method into or out of the working portion of 86.</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Especially for the only door approved by Connect dispatchers!</p>
 <p>&nbsp;<strong>Reason #02: The previous tenants of 86 should have had to forward their security deposit on leaving (to us!)</strong></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">The previous tenants of the portion of 86 we moved into must have really enjoyed their time there.</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Because they left us with a building that looked like the morning after a huge frat party to move into.</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">It is not just the security de\posit we earned, but their next year's morale budget should be redirected to our 86 beautifiion needs!</p>
 <p><strong>Reason #01: There are no window offices in Building 86!</strong></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">After being at Microsoft for more than ten years and three pror failed attempts, I finally have enough seniority to have a window office.</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Enter the cynic's dream, Building 86: the one without any window offices!</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">This must have been the building Safeco sent the peolple they didn't like very much....</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Our boss, a Senior Director who I&nbsp;believe is&nbsp;a Partner, has nothing more than a view to a window!</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">What's up with that?</p>
 <p><strong>And finally, bonus Reason #00: Buildings 84-86 are not properly handled by Connect!</strong></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">By established Connect rules and procedures, shuttles dispatched to the Safeco buildings always enter from the North and exit to the South.</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Unfortunately, from the point of view of both handicapped people and the ADA-approved shuttles that convey them, this is simply wrong.</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Wrong.</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">WRONG.</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">It forces the hadicapped to cross the thruway to shelters not properly equipped to handle them.</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">And it forces ADA-approved wheelchair vans to use lifts with&nbsp;insufficient space.</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">The fix would be easy: require ADA-approved shuttles traveling to/from buildings 84, 85, and/or 86 to enter from the south, and exit to the north!</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Of course, this flies iun the face of established Connect rules and procedures. And thus cannot happen.</p>
 <p>It may be fun in idle moments to tell&nbsp;people I will quit the first time these inaccessible doors cause me to spill a food tray.</p>
 <p>And it may be amusing to fantasize about the ADA lawsuit involving terrible working conditions and the constructive ternination they engender.</p>
 <p>The costs are not trivial: the estimated cost to retrofit ADA accessibility on Building 24 was $150,000 more than&nbsp;five years ago. While fixing the five doors in 86 may qualify them for a volume discount, it can still cost them upwards of 3/4 of&nbsp;a million dollars to fix.</p>
 <p>It may be cheaper for Microsoft to settle the lawsuits! :-)</p>
 <p>But in truth I like my job, and while they may not think me worth $750,000 to&nbsp;fix Building&nbsp;86 to be more&nbsp;accessible to me, they may think we worth the ~$600 to move me to a more accessible building like 26 or 9 or the Commons or anywhere else....</p>

<p>You probably suspected I was going to it some day.

<p>When I wrote that blog all those years ago <a href="../../../2007/12/02/6645014.html">Overheard: I miss running. Well, I also miss walking.... (aka For Brenda)</a>, everyone knew I'd give into the temptation some day.

<p>I didn't Google-stalk her, I Bing-stalked her. Maybe that made me feel better about the whole thing. 

<p>Or maybe you couldn't care less and never thought about it at all?

<p>Either way, I did it. I think I found her. She's a doctor in Wisconsin.

<p>Think I should call her some time and see if she remembers Donna and the seagull song  and the boy she picked that day? She might even remember it, you know!  
<p>It might be worth a conversation, at least. We can talk about the MS, and the iBOT. Right? üòè;-)

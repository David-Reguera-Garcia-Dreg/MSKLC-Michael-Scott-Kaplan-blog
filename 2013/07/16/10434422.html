<p>Back on June 25th, I bravely blogged a blog in this Blog titled <strong><a title="...the [World-Readiness] phoenix shall rise anew! (aka Note to self: check out my junk a little more often!)" href="../../06/25/10428504.html">...the [World-Readiness] phoenix shall rise anew! (aka Note to self: check out my junk a little more often!)</a></strong>.</p>
<p>As a brave follow-up to an earlier blog in this Blog titled <strong><a title="Out of the ashes of the old..." href="../../05/02/10415649.html">Out of the ashes of the old...</a>&#160;</strong>a month earlier.</p>
<p>And then no one heard from me for over three weeks!</p>
<p>Some of you probably didn't even notice.</p>
<p>Some of you thought I was being coy.</p>
<p>Others of you thought I was overpromising and underdelivering.</p>
<p>They were not too far off, ironically enough!</p>
<p>Today's content-free blog is to explain what happened to those of you who hung in there....</p>
<p>I started having tonic-clonic (formerly grand mal) seizures, poorly controlled by 125mg of Keppra BID.</p>
<p>Tonic–clonic seizures (formerly known as grand mal seizures, ICD-9 code 780.39) are a type of generalized seizure that affects the entire brain. Tonic–clonic seizures are the seizure type most commonly associated with epilepsy and seizures in general, though it is a misconception that they are the only type.</p>
<p>After I was hospitalized and they raised the dose to 250mg of Keppra BID, the tonic-clonic seizures were well controlled.</p>
<p>But the simple partial seizures had their days with me, and lost me a perfectly good pair of glasses they still haven't found yet.</p>
<p>And the complex partial seizures left me confused and eventually hospitalized again, due to the expressive aphasia they caused.</p>
<p>With my dose finally raised to 2000mg BID, I was left with only simple partial seizures, which (once I put them on a string so I wouldn't lose them anymore) were something I could live with....</p>
<p>So now, starting tomorrow, I will start blogging again, for real.</p>
<p>You don't have to believe me, but if you don't then this time you'll be wrong!&#160;:-)</p>

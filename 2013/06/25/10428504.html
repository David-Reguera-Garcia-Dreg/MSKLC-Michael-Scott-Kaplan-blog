<p>It was not quite two months ago (in <strong><a title="Out of the ashes of the old..." href="../../05/02/10415649.html">Out of the ashes of the old...</a></strong>) that I last blogged in this often <strong>World-Readiness</strong> focused Blog-o-mine, doubtful about the future.</p>
<p>And my future.</p>
<p>And the Blog's future, frankly.</p>
<p>Today, I return, quite sure about the all of those futures.</p>
<p>And of the role <strong>World-Readiness</strong> will play in all three.</p>
<p>But not of&nbsp; this one particular&nbsp;blog in the many blogs in this <strong><a title="Sorting it all Out" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/">Sorting it all Out</a></strong> Blog.</p>
<p>Because this one particular blog is not about <strong>World-Readiness</strong>, as&nbsp;so many blogs in this Blog have been about in the&nbsp;past, and&nbsp;will be about in the future.</p>
<p>This blog today is about something I seldom talk about.</p>
<p>My junk.</p>
<p>Now I don't judge those with different priorities than my own, but my junk is seldom something I talk about.</p>
<p>Or frankly something I even check out (b which I mean look at).</p>
<p>As I said, I don't judge.</p>
<p>If checking out your junk is a priority of yours, then I am happy for you. And I don't judge&nbsp;your priorities.</p>
<p>Or your world</p>
<p>However, as the subtitle for today's&nbsp;bog indicates, I am simply going to have to check out my junk once in a&nbsp;while.</p>
<p>Because on Sunday, May 19th, I was in the burn unit of <a title="Harborview Medical Center" href="http://www.uwmedicine.org/patient-care/locations/hmc/Pages/default.aspx">Harborview Medical Center</a> with 2nd and 3rd degree burns of my upper thighs and junk. I was inpatient for a week, eventually needing surgery while I was there.</p>
<p>You see, my case was pretty unique according to the doctors and nurses of <a title="Harborview Medical Center" href="http://www.uwmedicine.org/patient-care/locations/hmc/Pages/default.aspx">Harborview Medical Center</a>, for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The actual incident that caused the burns happened five days prior to me visiting the UWMC Emergency Room on Sunday morning;</li>
<li>Despite being regularly encouraged to make use of a standing <a title="Oxycontin" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxycontin">Oxycontin</a> prescription during the week I was in the hospital and after I left, I took no pain medications, not even Tylenol.</li>
</ul>
<p>You see, due to my over twenty year diagnosis of <a title="Multiple Sclerosis" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_Sclerosis">Multiple Sclerosis</a>, I have kind of an almost MS-induced <span dir="auto"><a title="Congenital insensitivity to pain" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_insensitivity_to_pain">Congenital insensitivity to pain</a>, not unlike the <a title="House" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_(TV_series)">House</a> episode <a title="Insensitive" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insensitive_(House)">Insensitive</a> where Hannah Morganthal (played by actress <a title="Mika Boorem" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mika_Boorem">Mika Boorem</a>) who everyone assumed had&nbsp;<strong><a title="***" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_insensitivity_to_pain_with_anhidrosis">***</a></strong> for much of the episode. </span></p>
<p><span dir="auto">In fact, each time I explained why&nbsp;I&nbsp;didn't want&nbsp;<a title="Oxycontin" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxycontin">Oxycontin </a>or <a title="Vicodin" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicodin">Vicodin</a>, the most common response was "like that girl from House" and "like that girl Hannah from House". :-)</span></p>
<p><span dir="auto">I would&nbsp;often explain that unlike <a title="CIP" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_insensitivity_to_pain">CIP</a> or <a title="***" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_insensitivity_to_pain_with_anhidrosis">***</a>, the cause&nbsp;for my&nbsp;problem was well-understood, though I shared many characteristics with both problems, like I could feel touch but not pain or temperature, and the way I freaked out and went to the ER when I accidentally noticed the damage&nbsp;early Sunday morning.</span></p>
<p><span dir="auto">Everyone agreed with my assessment that I should check out my junk more often!</span></p>
<p><span dir="auto">Some people would suggest I check <strong>everything</strong> out, not just my "junk". </span></p>
<p><span dir="auto"><em>The way they would refer to my junk was like they were quoting my usage, not using it as they would usually refer to a man's parts, thus my usage of quotes there.</em> :-)</span></p>
<p><span dir="auto">And some even pointed out all of "Hannah's"&nbsp;routines&nbsp; to check&nbsp;for problems and maybe I should do that, I would then point out it was simple triage; I'm not obsessive about my junk but I have prioritize the pieces! :-)</span></p>
<p><span dir="auto">Anyway, from now on I'll check my junk sometimes, and if I spill something wet (like I did on that fateful Tuesday!) I'll check to see if it was also hot, and caused some damage!</span></p>

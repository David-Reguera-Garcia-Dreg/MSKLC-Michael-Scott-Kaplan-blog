<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>Having a Blog is a huge responsibility, especially when you are blogging through your employer. I have found myself crossing the line on many occasions, in large part because I was seldom working from an organized schedule. I like to contrast myself with friend and colleague Raymond Chen, who writes blogs for his Blog many months in advance. I think it might drive me crazy to try that, since the temptation to re-visit and edit and change is simply *overwhelming*. Lacking the discipline of a Chen,  I guess I just need (if I ever want my original Blog to return) to have a separate place for blogs too far off topic.  I have decided to make it *this* place, where I can Sort the rest of it all Out. We'll see what happens from here...  Michael Kaplan     </div>

Was trying to direct a colleague to one of your posts, but could not do so.  Making all of your posts unavailable is a huge disservice to Microsoft customers who find your posts invaluable.  Sigh.</div>

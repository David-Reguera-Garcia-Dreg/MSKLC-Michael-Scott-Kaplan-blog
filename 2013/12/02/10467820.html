<p>Not too long ago, I wrote a blog titled <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2013/11/13/10465379.html">Mandarin vs. Cantonese</a>.
<p>In that blog, I chose to semi-intentionally conflate many different issues whose wider conflation by others leads to the reason why <b>Cantonese</b> can.be hard to capture in computers:
<ul>
<li>China vs. Hong Kong vs. Taiwan
<li>Spoken vs. written Chinese 
<li>Dialectic differences of Cantonese in different places
<li>Simplified vs. Traditional Chinese 
<li>Variations in educational levels in communities
<li>Rural vs. Urban Chinese
<li>Tonal differences of Chinese throughout the world 
<li>Defined tones used in different IMEs based on different defined schemes 
<li>National standards like GB 18030 and HKSCS
<li>International standards like Unicode 
<li>Pronunciation vs. other uses of tone data 
<li>and more....
</ul>
<p>I've decided, after talking with several regular readers, that I do Chinese in general and Cantonese in particular a disservice if I take advantage of that confusion in a single blog as I did in this case.
<p>Thus this series, trying to unconflate Chinese!
<p><i>For the record, I know that I'm kinda making up a word here. You know what I'm saying here, so I've decided that the usage is acceptable.</i>

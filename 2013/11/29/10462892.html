<h1>Whatever happened to my muse, Suzanne McCarthy?</h1>

<p>I have recently realized that I have lost something dear to me.
 <p>Or, to be more precise, some<b>one</b> dear to me.
 <p>She was my inspiration, my muse.
 <p>Amd I wonder aloud whatever happened to Suzanne McCarthy?
 <p>I lost touch with her some time ago, when she abandoned her old blog named <a href="http://abecedaria.blogspot.com/">Abecedaria</a>, where she stopped blogging to on Saturday, April 15, 2006.
 
 <p>The self-described "blog about keyboarding in diverse scripts, literacy and digital literacy, and random quotes selected from the history of writing system theory" was now gone.
 <p>Without warning of any kind.
 <p><i>Perhaps she felt under-appreciated and thought that she would not be missed?</i>
 <p>I assure you that she was! I may be slow but I get there eventually! 😏😏😏
 <p>So I took to Bing to try to figure out where she went to.
 <p>Apparently, she stayed on the Google-owned Blogspot, and moved to <a href="http://powerscourt.blogspot.com/">Suzanne's Bookshelf</a>, self-described as
 <blockquote> 
 originally named in memory of Lady Powerscourt, one of the 'Chief Women among the Brethren,' this is simply a place for me to collect stray thoughts about the Bible, women, the Brethren, Bible translation, manuscripts, writing systems, movies, books....
 </blockquote>
 <p>This took me to Sunday, September 25, 2011. At which point she moved again!
 <p>After that, she moved to <a href="http://bltnotjustasandwich.com/">BLTnotjustasandwich</a>, a Blog with a description of:
 <blockquote>
 BLT is not just a sandwich.  It’s also a blog.  This particular blog is a place to discuss the Bible, other Literature, and its Translation.  The conversation may include the history, theory, and practice of translating.  And we’re not necessarily after agreement.  We’d like to hear whatever you have to say.
 <p>We are J. K. Gayle, Suzanne McCarthy, Craig R. Smith, Theophrastus, and Victoria Gaile Laidler
 </blockquote>
 <p>I wonder what I could do to coax her back to Abecedaria, anyway? Could I get her back? 
 <p>Suzanne, could I get you to come back once in a while? 😏😆😏😆😏😆

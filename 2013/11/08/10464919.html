<p>I feel like we've been here before.
<p>Many different times.
<p>There was the New Turkish Lira.
<p>And then the new symbol, a few years later.
<p>Of course everyone knows about the Euro. We update countries that use it all the time!
<p>Will we ever forget the new Rupee symbol?u
<p>The changes affect locale data, keyboards, and fonts across many versions (this is the one time we will update locale data after we ship).
<p>What is behind all of these changes?
<p>National pride? Honor within a country?
<p>Clearly, it is impossible to ignore whenever it occurs.
<p>And do you know what?1
<p>It's happening again!
<p>You can read all about it <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/emergingeurope/2013/11/06/russians-vote-on-ruble-symbol/">right here</a>, on the Wall Street Journal Blog, where the process they are going through in Russia to choose among the five finalists of the one thousand choices they had.
<p>You can go to the Central Bank's site <a href="http://cbr.ru/today/?prtid=voterub">here</a> if you know Russian, or just want to look at the five pictures.
<p>Or if you want Bing's translation, you can look right <a href="http://www.microsofttranslator.com/bv.aspx?from=&amp;to=en&amp;a=http://cbr.ru/today/?prtid=voterub">here</a>.
<p>One funny thing about these changes is how they throw companies into a panic with meetings and aliases and emails and download packages and so on.
<p>Some companies never learn the lesson that the process is going to happen again so they should document the steps, so it will be easier next time.
<p>But some companies are finally learning.
<p>Where does your company sit in this situation?

<p>The dichotomy between Windows 7 and Windows 8 was as obvious as ever, and for some even more obvious with Windows 8.1...
<p> Windows 8 without a touch screen was idiocy.
<p>And Windows 7 with a touch screen was a waste.
<p>This difference between three operating systems were ignored by some.
<p>They were, on the other hand, embraced by some other people with the Surface RT 2 and the Surface Pro 2, which so readily proved that the iPad wasn't <b>all that</b>. 
<p>It was an open challenge to the OEM partners to <b>be at least as cool as this, and more cool if you dare!</b> &#128527;&#128527;&#128527;
<p>Would the partners take the bait and strive to be as cool or even more cool, as the challenge indicated?
<p>Or would they give up and look elsewhere.
<p>Is it so hard to strive to be awesome in this area?
<p>You might think so from the way the OEM partners reacted.
<p>It was as if creativity had been bred out of their DNA or something like that.
<p>Not <b>everyone</b> took the challenge that way.
<p>Dell and Lenovo stepped up to the challenge in some of their new offerings, without even breaking a sweat.
<p>Others were not so quick to jump into the ring with anything much.
<p>What were they waiting for?
<p>It was kind of embarrassing, you know.
<p>People were really going to have to try a little harder if they want to impress people...&#128527;&#128518;&#128518;&#128527;&#128518;&#128527;

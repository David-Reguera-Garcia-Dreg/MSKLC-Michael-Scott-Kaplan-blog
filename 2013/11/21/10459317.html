<p>The other day, when I blogged <a href="../../10/03/10453584.html">A long last, victorious we were</a>, I got one of the details wrong.

<p>As mistakes go, it was a pretty serious one.

<p>Remember when I was asked when it started, and I said I wasn't sure, but I thought it was from the date of the email?

<p>I shouldn't have guessed.

<p>I don't know why I did?
 
<p>Because that guess was wrong.

<p>Really, really wrong.

<p>Basically, all <b>"GIVE"</b> contributions on or after January 1st are eligible!

<p>I know of several people who will benefit from that difference.

<p>Including one person who just left Microsoft!

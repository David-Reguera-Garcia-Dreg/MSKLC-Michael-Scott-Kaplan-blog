<p>On September 29th, 2013 (two days after my birthday), the following note was put into the Suggestion Box by Piotr Dobrogost:
<blockquote>

Michael,
<p>Thanks for sharing very interesting information on keyboard handling in Windows with us!
<p>I've read all your posts regarding AltGr key but nowhere in them I found answers to the following questions:
<ul>
<li>How to have right Alt key act like left (&quot;normal&quot;) Alt key?
<li>How to disable treating Alt+Ctrl as AltGr?
</ul>
<p>Thanks in advance for answers to above questions.
<p>Best regards,
<p>Piotr Dobrogost
</blockquote>
<p>Now as title indicates, this almost feels like a late birthday present to me! &#128527;;-)
<p>Because as much as you hate to admit it, it feels good sometimes to tell people &quot;<b>You can't get there from here, sorry!</b>&quot;...
<p>Things are what they are, you know? &#128527;;-)
<p>I am sorry to tell Piotr Dobrogost this, but both items on the list of his are unsupportable, and thus unsupported (by me or anyone else)....
<p>Now I feel kinda bad about enjoying this so much.
<p>But it was for my birthday (well kinda!), and I hope Piotr won't begrudge me that guilty pleasure in honor of that day....

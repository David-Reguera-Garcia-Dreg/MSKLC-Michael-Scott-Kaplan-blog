<h1>I am not the only blogger who supports ObamaCare...</h1>

<p>Regular readers of this Blog learn things about me.
<p>For example, the ones who read <a href="../../10/29/10460658.html">The company that is rescuing trigeminal.com is the one that will be fixing healthcare.gov! ‚ôø‚ôø‚ôø</a> learned that I support ObamaCare.
<p><b>The Affordable Health Care Act</b>.
<p>But I'm not the only one.
<p>For example, my online blogger friend Erin Kotecki Vest  a.k.a. The Queen of Spain, likes it, too.
<p>And not just for theoretical reasons like me.
<p><i>After all, I am technically losing some of my excellent health insurance coverage at Microsoft due to ObamaCare.</i>
<p>Erin, on the other hand, has something significant to gain from it.
<p>Actually, to be more technically precise, one million, eight hundred and ninety-one thousand somethings.
<p>That is how many pennies the Affordable Health Care Act looks like will be saving her next year.
<p>You shouldn't just take my word for it.
<p>Instead, you can read all about it in her blog from yesterday.
<p>She called it <a href="http://queenofspainblog.com/2013/11/13/we-just-enrolled-in-obamacare/">We Just Enrolled in Obamacare</a>.
<p>Personally, I am 247% thrilled about this!
<p>Congratulations, Erin!!! üòèüòèüòèüòèüòèüòèüòè

<p>Government bureaucrats will now be picking out which doctors and hospitals you can go to and how long you will have to wait for medical procedures especially once you are older or maybe they will just decide to give you a little pain pill and send you home to wait for the end. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I wonder what kind of future doctors we will have? &nbsp;The truly excellent minds that make all A grades and work hard to revolutionize their field of study or the most common denominator C grade doctors who are just there for a paycheck and living off the taxpayers?? &nbsp;We already know the government has never been able to manage Medicare and its funding, what makes people think it will get any better now? &nbsp; They cannot even keep the US Postal Office in the black and it is nowhere as complicated as medical care.</p>
<p>While you may think of an Utopian society, it will not happened because of the simple fact that people are corrupt which in turn governments are corrupt. &nbsp;It is a fact of life. &nbsp;It will be interesting in about 20 years to see how you feel and how the great government is treating you. Good luck. </p>

<p><strong>Willem van Straaten</strong> on 15 Nov 2013 9:24 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>@Wade: Funding Obamacare would not be much of a problem, if the billionaires and trusts would actually pay a fair amount of taxes and not stockpile their money offshore. Ever heard of a Double Irish? Although invented by AAPL, both GOOG and MSFT are not better regarding tax avoidance.</p>
<p>Every people has the government it deserves. If you are not happy with America and the direction it has chosen to take, feel free to emigrate. Canada has no Obamacare... </p>
<p>Seriously, you think you control even parts of your life? Very funny. Visa and Mastercard and Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan do, but you? Keep telling that yourself! If there was no government to tame the trusts, you would soon love to enjoy the european &quot;oppression&quot;. But I guess most rednecks are too ignorant to realise that their &quot;freedom&quot; is in fact neo-feudalism: A handful of super rich families rule the country and the whole rest is kept poor on purpose. If there were not that much immigrants to the U.S. to exploit, you soon would not have any doctors at all. </p>
<p>If all those tea party fanatics hate the government that much, why don&#39;t they just emigrate to Somalia? It is the tea party&#39;s paradise, since there is no government at all and you can freely choose your doctor...</p>

<p>An Egyptian Hieroglyph.

<p>Not just any old Hieroglyph.

<p>To some it could be thought of as <b>THE</b> Hieroglyph.

<p>This is the character that is on the conference t-shirt from IUC #37.

<p>Every Character Under the Sun, according to the t-shirt.

<p>According to <a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/1305b/index.htm">fileformat.info</a>, it is Unicode Character 'EGYPTIAN HIEROGLYPH C002'.

<p>I think the t-shirt is a bit more informative, certainly a bit more aspirational at least:

<p>Doncha think? 😏😏😏

<p>Ok, it may not be accurate to call that the name. But it IS more astute, not to mention more fun! 😏😏

<p>I can't help but think of the original Stargate movie and the Ra character!! 😏😏

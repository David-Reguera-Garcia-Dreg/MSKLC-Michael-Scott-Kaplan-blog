<p>Regular readers may remember my plea for an App for the phone that I made in the end of September in my blog <a href="../../09/30/10452589.html">Any Phone App developers out there reading here? I need an App for my &iexcl;next! Nokia Lumia...</a>.</p>
<p>I was pretty harsh on the examples of Apps that seemed to work in theory but couldn't get the work done in practice.</p>
<p>It turns out I was being too harsh.</p>
<p>These Apps are literally doing the best they can here.</p>
<p>Because I have it on good authority that there is no supported way to get the entire layout of the Start Screen.</p>
<p>If you place something on the Start Screen yourself, then you'll be able to see pieces of the Start Screen nearby. Which is what those Apps let you do.</p>
<p>To my way of thinking, this is a cure that is worse than the disease, since it adds a lot of extra stuff to the Start Screen that will make it much longer for no good reason.</p>
<p>Unless they add special capabilities to some future version to let you check out the whole Start Screen, then for now I will have to settle for just taking screen shots of the whole Start Screen if I want the ability to have the Start Screen that you can re-apply to a new phone or replacement phone...</p>
<p>I don't know about you, but I change my Start Screen fairly often. I will just have to hope that a future version has more ability to query information about the Start Screen layout.... And to <strong>Group Tiles</strong> by <strong>vSoft Studios</strong> and <strong>Name Group of Tiles</strong> by <strong>Naveen Kumar</strong>, I apologize. You were clearly doing your best here!</p>

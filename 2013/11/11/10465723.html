<p>It is all well and good when I talk about the Surface and what it can do. 
<p>But it much more gratifying to have other people do it.
<p>And do it on TV commercials like this one:

</blockquote>
<p>There is something that is very liberating about that!
<p><i>At least there is for me!</i>
<p>Perhaps you don't feel the same way.
<p>You may be so happy with your iPad that you've never even looked st the Surface or Surface 2 at all.
<p>But maybe after you check out the above video, you'll give the Surface RT 2 or Surface Pro 2 a look.
<p>I think it just might make your day! &#128527;&#128527;&#128527;

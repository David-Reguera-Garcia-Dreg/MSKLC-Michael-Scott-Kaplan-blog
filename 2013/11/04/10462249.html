<h1>Bing Translator vs. Google Translator gives some surprises...</h1>

<p>It is a point I have made before in blogs like <a href="../../../2006/08/05/689506.html">Google doesn't seem to get blogs</a> 
and <a href="../../../2006/10/14/824497.html">Not for use on unexplained calf pain</a>, blogs from the distant past...but it has been a while, so I decided to look at another side of the same problem, comparing Google to Bing...

<p>So I recently had an opportunity to do a comparison of Bing's translation skills versus Google's, when a Dev evangelist from Windows Phone 8 in Japan wrote a blog about the feature, and I noticed some very interesting things.</p>
<p>First, here is his blog:

</blockquote>

<p>Now, you can try to run them through:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://translate.google.com/m/translate" target="_new">translate.google.com/m/translate</a>
<li><a href="http://www.bing.com/translator/" target="_new">www.bing.com/translator/</a>
</ol>

<p>Second</p>
<p>You will get some interesting surprises!</p>
<p><img src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/wp8/2626.googletranslate.png" alt="" width="40%" /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <img src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/wp8/8321.bingtranslate.png" alt="" width="40%" /></p>
<ul>
<li>First of all, the Google translator is faster. <br /><br /> While at first this may seem like a win for them, it is actually a lose; the coolest part about an auto translator is *watching* the translation happen, and they lose this right out of the gate. I almost wonder whether we could use this technique for some localized products!  <br /><br /></li>
<li>Second of all, there are the defaults: <br /><br /> Bing defaults to From=auto-detect and To=my language. <br /><br /> Google defaults to two huge lists where From=my language and To=some random language down the list, in my case Hebrew. <br /><br /> maybe they are in translation business now or something, but pretty much every translation that a regular <strong>*user*</strong> has works the way Bing has it. Bing:2, Google:0. <br /><br /></li>
<li>Third of all, translation quality varies so much between them, that you almost have to run them both, depending on the subject. <br /><br />So no points for either of them, sometimes.

<br><br> Microsoft happens to win this one too, in my humble opinion (translatability on their minds, perhaps? 😏😏😏)

<p>And one more time: Bing:3, Google:0!!!</p>
<p>You almost have to feel bad for them! Almost! 😏😏</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm just so struck by how <strong>*bad*</strong> Google is at this. It is almost like they know people are doing amateur translation work and they aren't even trying to help the <b>customers</b>, here!

<p>Ah well, we will just have to go on being more awesome than them. The best kept secret on the Internet! 

<p>Sssh! Don't tell anyone, you hear? 😏😏😏

<p>(Knowing Michael though he might not consider that a plus).</p>

<p><strong>Alex Cohn</strong> on 5 Nov 2013 12:24 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>This being an MSDN blog, or because there is so much C#, my Chrome does not recognize this page as Japanese, and does not offer automatic translation. But luckily, it does remember my last preference of &quot;from&quot; and &quot;to&quot; languages on Google Translate. (In my case, &quot;from&quot; was &quot;Detect language&quot;).</p>
<p>The result was just as good as one could hope for such technical article: C# was translated to Java^H^H^H^H^H… still readable. </p>
</div>
<p><strong>GregM</strong> on 11 Nov 2013 5:20 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Sorry Michael, but I have to disagree with both of your &quot;scoring&quot; points. &nbsp;First, slower is not a win. &nbsp;I don&#39;t want to watch the page get translated, that&#39;s not useful. &nbsp;Second, Google Translate, in my experience, defaults to either what you used last, if it knows who you are, or &quot;detect language&quot; to &quot;my language&quot; otherwise.</p>
<p>Also, why are you comparing the mobile Google Translate site to the normal Bing translate site?</p>

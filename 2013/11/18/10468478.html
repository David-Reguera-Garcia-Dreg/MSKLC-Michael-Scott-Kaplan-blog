<p>I love social media.
<p>Every time I write a blog, I post a link to it on Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn.
<p>But it has a cost.
<p>So many people try to comment there that sometimes people only comment there, even if they read about the issue here.
<p>So the blog suffers, ultimately.
<p>Well that has to end, or at least slow down a bit...
<p>But how to do it, exactly?
<p>I mean sure people will probably comment in the right place.
<p>I could have blog titles that were less descriptive.
<p>But as a strategy, that is pretty obnoxious, isn't it?
<p>It isn't in my nature to be deceptive.
<p>I mean it can be fun to draw people in that way.
<p>If your content doesn't help you then people won't stay.
<p>But then, I remembered the thing I figured several years ago.
<p>My most common readers are not the ones who follow me.
<p>They are the people who found the Blog off of a Bing or Google search for a topic that I covered.
<p>A random blog from years before like <a href="../../../2005/01/18/355210.html">The jury will give this string no weight</a> to grab somebody's attention years later.
<p>Now for the record, the previous sentence is not contrived; I get between two and six emails a week based on various blogs I've written, and occasionally my manager will find out about it if the person (within Microsoft) sends &quot;kudos&quot; about the assistance (kudos are an internal Microsoft thing that my manager hears about if someone thanks me for there). It has the added benefit of reminding everyone that the Blog can help people years later.
<p>Maybe something I covered yesterday or maybe something talked about years ago, after blogging for nine years there is a lot of material to draw on! &#128518;&#128518;&#128518;&#128518;&#128518;

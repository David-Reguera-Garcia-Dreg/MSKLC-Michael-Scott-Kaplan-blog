<p>I was thinking about Ender's Game the other day.
<p>Well, at the same time, I was also thinking about Ender's Shadow.
<p>The former was a story I had loved for twenty years.
<p>And the latter was one that had been troubling me for as long as I had known about it.
<p>The problem was only compounded by the fact that I almost had the chance to have a brief part in the movie when it came out.
<p>Now the author, Orson Scott Card, makes the problem even more complicated for me because he credits the movie being about <b>both</b> books, as a way of getting it made as a &quot;Hollywood <b>Buddy</b> style movie&quot;.
<p>Personally, I had always felt a little betrayed by the second story.
<p>It stole from me much of the original story's majesty, or maybe Ender's majesty.
<p> Not that I ever thought I was smart enough to be an Ender Wiggin.
<p>I didn't even think myself worthy of being a Bean.
<p>But like when I was introduced by one of the Wieders to Robert A. Heinlein in my youth based largely on his <b>Stranger in a Strange Land</b>, I introduced Orson Scott Card to others over the years to people based largely on Ender's Game.
<p>Somehow it was MY story, that I shared with others.
<p>I felt betrayed by Ender's Shadow, by the fictional Bean, by Orson Scott Card for sullying my memory of a story I have loved for so long.
<p>And yet even in Ender's Shadow, Ender Wiggins gets to be the hero, and Bean seems a little less human, somehow.
<p>So I have trapped myself for the last few weeks, listening to the <i>Audible</i> book <b>Ender's Game</b> followed by the <i>Audible</i> book <b>Ender's Shadow</b>, trying to keep my old hero who had his reputation damaged by how it turned out the story actually was, after the fact.
<p>Isn't George Lucas the only one who was supposed to muck with the story after it came out?
<p>Oh, I guess not.
<p>Even Robert A. Heinlein did it by continuing to change the tapestry by having later books grow out of earlier ones.
<p>From <b>The Moon is a Harsh Mistress</b> to <b>The Cat Who Walks Through Walls</b> and so on, mucking with the story seems to be the way these &quot;World as Myth&quot; stories get told by him..
<p>The way that Robert A. Heinlein did it didn't betray my hopes; as a young man I could dream that if i wrote a great science fiction story that Gay Deceiver could pop in and Lazarus Long could make me a part of the story somehow!
<p>But what Orson Scott Card did to <b>Ender's Game</b> by writing <b>Ender's Shadow</b>, in an even worse way then George Lucas did with the &quot;Han Shot First&quot; debacle, feels like a much worse crime.
<p>Suddenly, I'm glad I wasn't a child when I read <b>Ender's Game</b>. Yet I still feel betrayed somehow...
<p>I was going to reach out to Orson Scott Card to tell him how I almost got to be a small part of the movie Ender's Game (unless saved later by Gavin Hood and his director's cut), but I realized I would be too distracted by my disappointment in Ender's Shadow.
<p>Suddenly I found myself back in New Orleans having lunch next to Harrison Ford and biting my tongue to avoid trying to take him to task for the Indiana Jones/Crystal Skull debacle, and possibly even getting fired for my trouble.
<p>But now I'm not in the movie and may never even be in some Director's Cut. Maybe I should have spoken my mind to Harrison Ford when I had the chance!!!! &#128527;&#128518;&#128527;&#128518;&#128527;&#128518;&#128527;&#128518;

 <p>Do you want to hate Chanukah?
 <p>That's easy!
 <p>All you have to do is be somewhat intellectual and then be either a Jew or a Christian.
 <p>This would allow you to learn the lesson taught in my blog from long ago <a href="../../../2006/12/24/1358825.html">Happy ____________ (fill in the blank whatever you celebrate this time of year)</a>.
 <p>You will be cured of feeling the joy of the holiday season in no time!
 <p>Do you want to hate Thanksgiving?
 <p>That is admittedly a little more work.
 <p>The easiest way is to be Native American.
 <p>And if you aren't, then you could simply take the time to find oneself in a serious relationship with someone who is Native American.
 <p>That is pretty much all it will take.
 <p>You know?
 <p>I will not spend a bunch of space in this blog explaining why such a (relatively) easy step is all it takes to ruin Thanksgiving.
 <p>Either you understand why it would have this effect or you don't.
 <p>It shouldn't be too hard to guess why it would have this effect if you think about it.
 <p>Now it doesn't happen often, the way these two holidays take place together at the end of November like they do this year.
 <p>But it makes for a disappointing time of year, let me tell you!!!! ðŸ˜’ðŸ˜’ðŸ˜’ðŸ˜’ðŸ˜’ðŸ˜’

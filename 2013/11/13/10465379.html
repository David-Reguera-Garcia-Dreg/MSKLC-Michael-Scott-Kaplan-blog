<h1>Mandarin vs. Cantonese</h1>

<p>Recently, at IUC 37 in Santa Clara, when I was talking about MSKLC, one of the of the people in the audience (whose name is Stephan Stiller) was asking questions.
<p>Not MSKLC questions.
<p>They really were not keyboard questions at all.
<p>They were actually IME questions.  
<p>Questions about a specific IME, actually.
<p>The Cantonese IME, in fact.
<p><i><b>Uh oh.</b></i>
<p>That one has a problem.
<p>Well, the <i>IME</i> doesn't really have a specific problem.
<p>But anyone trying to support Cantonese may notice a problem that some people have with Cantonese.
<p>I mentioned it back in Vista in <a href="../../../2006/07/27/679538.html">this</a> blog!
<p>There is just a not insignificant number of people in China or Taiwan who speak Chinese.
<p><b>Mandarin</b> Chinese. <i>Not</i> <b>Cantonese</b> Chinese. 
<p>If you catch my drift.
<p>I wouldn't necessarily consider it to be a serious issue of <b>bias</b> or <b>prejudice</b> or anything like that.
<p>It seems kind of butter side up/butter side down to me, but maybe I'm just showing off.... 
<p>Perhaps it is a little bit of <b>prejudice</b> of some kind, but only subconsciously so.
<p>Most people wouldn't believe they are guilty of such a thing if you pointed it out to them. They wouldn't take the accusation seriously.
<p>But <b>Cantonese</b> has certain differences from <b>Mandarin</b> in ways that some people would find interesting.
<p>Cantonese has more tones than Mandarin, for example. It can be hard for Mandarin speakers to follow some of those complexities.
<p>I don't necessarily think <i>that</i> is a very good reason to refuse to take it seriously.
<p>But I don't really speak either of them fluently, so some would not consider me to be qualified to have an opinion in such a situation.
<p>Maybe so. But I know <b>bias</b> and <b>prejudice</b> when I see them, and I do not need to know a language to recognize those things...
<p>If everyone spoke Cantonese then no one would be able to have problems recognizing those additional tones. And fewer people would be in a position to dislike those additional tones.
<p>That is probably why I tried to add the Cantonese IME in the first place, even though later versions had people so willingly choose to let it go.
<p>I doubt that it is an accident that Cantonese is really only ever used in Traditional Chinese, and is pretty much unknown in Simplified Chinese.
<p>Well, that isn't really true, as <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantonese">this</a> Wikipedia article explains. But many people deny it even exists as a written language, and thus claiming it has a Simplified form at all is just crazy!
<p>It makes it all the more ironic that GB18030 covers both forms of Chinese (Simplified <b>and</b> Traditional) despite the fact that China is so clearly preferring Simplified Chinese and Mandarin form of the language.
<p>But the standard was always pushing the envelope to cover not just Chinese but also more and more of its minority languages.
<p>Microsoft has to keep up with GB18030 and every new permutation that each new version brings.
<p>Even that Cantonese IME, in the end! &#128527;&#128527;&#128527;&#128527;

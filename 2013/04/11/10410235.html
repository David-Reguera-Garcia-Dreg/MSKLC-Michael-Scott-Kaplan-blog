<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Nothing technical whatsoever in this blog today!</em></span></strong></p>
<p>It was a cross-eyed conversation, to be sure.</p>
<p>Have you ever had one of those?</p>
<p>They can be <em>rewarding</em>, though usually they're just grueling.</p>
<p>Every once in a long while, they can be both!</p>
<p>She was an ex-girlfriend.</p>
<p>Aren't they all?</p>
<p>But she was the first ex who was a full-time serf once I became a serf, over 4400 days ago.</p>
<p>At least she wasn't the not ex of a serf, the one who wasn't as separated as she claimed to be.</p>
<p><em>Talk about grueling and unrewarding! That one, I'll keep off the Blog!</em></p>
<p>She had just been relieved of her job, and told to find a new one, or absent that, to just get out.</p>
<p>Given all that,&nbsp;she wasn't too terribly happy, and more than a little bit stressed.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"So Michael," she opened, "what are you doing in a window office in&nbsp;the Partner Solutions Center? Weren't you on some localization team somewhere?"<br />"They were a World-Readiness team attached to a localization team," I quipped, annoyed at the odd&nbsp;distinction that no normal human makes.<br />"Sorry," she offered. "But what are&nbsp;you doing in Building 25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Funny you should ask me that," I start. "My old group had some real challenges with accessibility and those issues kind of came to a head."<br />She blinked. "So you quit and end ended up here?"<br />"No, nothing like that. But they were holding me back," I explained. "I had to do something."<br />"What did you do?" she asked.<br />"I had to do something, like I said. So I thanked them for all of their efforts, and I 86'd them."<br />"You fired them all?" she asked nervously. "I thought you were a Program Manager 2. Where'd you get the authority?"<br />"Oh, I got promoted," I explained "I didn't do it myself. I have people to do that sort of thing now."<br />"Wow, I never knew you had it in you!" she said wonderingly. "Are you a DE or a TF or a VP now?"<br />"Talk to my people, we'll have lunch!" I quipped.</p>
<p>Eventually I dropped the charade, and explained that the World-Readiness team attached to a localization team was still around, and I was still working for them. But they did all get moved to Building 86, which when everything is said and done may cost &frac34; of a million to retrofit accessible entrances, throughways, and egresses. So rather than firing me or making me work from home, they paid the low low price of&nbsp;$500 to move me, into a window office in the Partner Solutions Center. I work from home half the&nbsp;time and visit the perpetually inaccessible 86 maybe once a month.</p>
<p>And there was a happy ending -- she got an offer on the last day of her search.</p>
<p>All things considered, this particular cross-eyed conversation was pretty rewarding!</p>

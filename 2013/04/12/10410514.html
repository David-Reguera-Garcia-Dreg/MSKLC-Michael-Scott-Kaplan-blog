<h1>'Lucida Sans Typewriter Bold Oblique' is not really such a great name for a font</h1>

<p>Over in the Suggestion Box, Mike asked:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">LOGFONT LF_FACESIZE potential buffer overrun?</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">LOGFONT LF_FACESIZE is only 32 characters, but I found a font name (I assume installed by Windows) that was greater than 32 characters:</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Lucida Sans Typewriter Bold Oblique</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Sure enough it crashes at least two programs I tried just by picking it. &nbsp;Bad limitation or just poorly written code?</span></em></p>
<p>Well, on the whole I would tend to blame the crashing programs.</p>
<p>It is their bug, after all!</p>
<p>I am of two minds on this issue.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the name of the font is its least important attribute -- the <strong>font file name</strong> is what's important.</p>
<p>Most of the filenames fit 8.3 naming rules.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, the name of the font is its most important attribute -- the font author has their ego and their creative spirit tied up in it.</p>
<p>We are, however, confusing other attributes of the font here.</p>
<p>The font's core identity is <strong>Lucida Sans Typewriter</strong>; the fact that it may choose to be bold or oblique is kind of besides the point, isn't it?</p>
<p>So in this case the bug is in the program trying to cram other attributes into the name that are better served by other members of the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd145037(v=vs.85).aspx">LOGFONT</a>.</p>
<p>This neatly sidesteps the entire issue, since <strong>Lucida Sans Typewriter</strong> fits well within the limit! :-)</p>
<p>If you want me to tackle the larger issue, you'll have to come up with a longer core font name.</p>
<p>If you can!</p>

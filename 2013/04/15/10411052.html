<p>When is it a dialect, and when is it a language?</p>
<p>I know, I know. "<strong>A language is a dialect with an army and a navy.</strong>"</p>
<p>Or as the Yiddish linguist I'm about to lovingly misquote might say:</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: large;"><a href="../../../2005/07/25/443046.html">אײ סובקולטור איז אַ שפּראַך מיט אַן אַרמײ און אַ פֿלאָט</a></span></span></strong></p>
<p>But what if the navy isn't used, the army doesn't fire a shot, and the majority of the country still identifies with the older language?</p>
<p>We're not talking about <strong>Bosnian</strong>. Or <strong>Croatian</strong>. Or <strong>Serbo-Croatian</strong>. Or even <strong>Serbian</strong>.</p>
<p>We're talking about <strong>Montenegrin</strong>.</p>
<p>The language of the people in <strong>Montenegro</strong>.</p>
<p>And the people just voted themselves out of <strong>Serbia</strong>, and just like that <em>became</em> <strong>Montenegro</strong>.</p>
<p>Simple majority rule, democracy at its very best!</p>
<p>Though for the language itself, things were a little more complicated.</p>
<p>Rather than 100%,&nbsp;more like&nbsp;38.2% of them who say that is what they're speaking is <strong>Montenegrin</strong> (as opposed to the 41.6% who say it is <strong>Serbian</strong> that people are speaking!).</p>

<p>Of course they prefer the Latin to the Cyrillic, as most do in the pot-Soviet world. Nothing <em>too</em> personal. But the Russians kept invading!</p>
<p>As per Wikipedia's article about <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montenegrin_language">Montenegrin</a></strong>, According to the latest poll of 1,001 Montenegrin citizens conducted by&nbsp;Matica crnogorska in mid 2010:</p>
<ul>
<li>41.6% Serbian</li>
<li>38.2% Montenegrin</li>
<li>12.3% - Serbian, Montenegrin, Bosnian, Croatian and Serbo-Croatian are one and the same</li>
<li>4.4% Serbo-Croatian</li>
<li>1.9% Bosnian</li>
<li>1.7% Croatian</li>
</ul>
<p>But those two extra letters give them an edge in their argument that not all of those Slavic languages have....</p>
<p>So the pro-Montenegrins of Montenegro won the war without firing a shot!</p>
<p>So my Slovakian friend and colleague has 12 bugs assigned to her, all about the need to move from <strong>sr-Cyrl-ME</strong> and <strong>sr-Latn-ME</strong> to <strong>me-Cyrl-ME</strong> and <strong>me-Cyrl-ME</strong>.</p>
<p>It could have been one bug.</p>
<p>In fact, it should have been one bug.</p>
<p>She isn't complaining though. They've all been tagged for vNext Follow Up.</p>
<p>So, assuming I haven't been fired or arrested or died by next version, I can look forward to seeing those 12 bugs assigned to me!</p>
<p>And then I'll be wishing it was just one bug. :-)</p>
<p>And at least 38.2% of <strong>Montenegrins</strong> can proudly cry "<strong>the version after next of Windows was my idea, and it's all about ME!</strong>"</p>
<hr/><p><strong>Random832</strong> on 15 Apr 2013 10:07 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>On the subject of collation - are there any locales that make an effort to collate two scripts together, to the extent that there is a one-to-one correspondence between letters (or digraphs) in the two scripts?</p>

<p><strong>John Cowan</strong> on 15 Apr 2013 10:50 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Umm, I should think that me-Latn and me-Cyrl would be enough; whatever you can say about Standard Montenegrin, nobody uses it outside Montenegro. &nbsp;(Except of course that actually they *do*, as that 12.3% is willing to say and everybody else knows perfectly well. &nbsp;But that&#39;s neither here nor there.)</p>
<p>I wonder, is Windows ME popular there?</p>

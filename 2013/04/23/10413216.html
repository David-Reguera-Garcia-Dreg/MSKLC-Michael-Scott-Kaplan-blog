<p>In a comment to&nbsp;<strong><a title="Blame Canada! aka Where is the RIGHT CTRL key on *this* keyboard, Canada?" href="../19/10409187.html">Blame Canada! aka Where is the RIGHT CTRL key on *this* keyboard, Canada?</a></strong>,&nbsp;Eric C&ocirc;t&eacute; responded:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">I live in Montreal. Most French-Canadians are going to avoid the "multilingual" keyboard and instead opt for the friendlier "Canadian French" keyboard. Even the Surface keyboard that you buy in Montr&eacute;al and Qu&eacute;bec City is going to use the "Canadian French" keyboard. Microsoft Hardware has been selling "Canadian French" keyboards since the late 90s.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">But here's a sad story: when you use the new "language" control panel, if you select "Fran&ccedil;ais (Canada)", it is going to default your keyboard to "Canadian Multilingual Standard".</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">The same happens if you get a new computer that goes through the new "out-of-box experience" (that's the set of screens during the initial boot of a new computer). It's going to ask you "English or French" and defaultd your keyboard accordingly. If you choose "French" with a Canadian Time Zone, you'll automatically get "Canadian multilingual Standard".</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">And there's no obvious way to change that for non-technical users. I dare you to try!</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">Answer: &nbsp;Go to the "Language" Control Panel, click "option" just beside "Fran&ccedil;ais (Canada)", "Add an input method", and then you see a panel with an alphabetical list of all French keyboard, followed by an alphabetical list of NON-French Keyboards. Go to the second list and find "Canadian French" (yep, that is a bug, it should be on the first list. Making things worse, there's also a "Canadian French (Legacy)" on the first list that dates back from the Win3.0 days and that should absolutely be avoided.)</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">Every time I see someone with a Surface connected to a French Canadian Keyboard, it's always using the wrong keyboard layout. People always go: "hey, it's a buggy Microsoft product, this wouldn't happen with Apple". &nbsp;The source of problem is thus: the default layout from Microsoft Hardware isn't following the default layout from the Windows division.</span></p>
<p>Now I wish what Eric C&ocirc;t&eacute; was saying here was true.</p>
<p>And that most Canadian French users added the "Fran&ccedil;ais (Canada)" keyboard layout and removed the "Canadian Multilingual Standard" keyboard layout.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I have some statistics that contradict the claim a little. Or maybe a lot?</p>
<p>You see, according to our info, fewer than 5% of all people who install Windows ever launch Regional and Language Options.</p>
<p>Plus, fewer than 5% of those people actually change any of the settings.</p>
<p>And on top of all that, at least 1% change the setting back.</p>
<p>Therefore, for the claims of Eric C&ocirc;t&eacute; to be true, the sales figures of Microsoft Canada would have to be&nbsp; more than&nbsp;eight times what they are now!</p>
<p>But it is true what Eric C&ocirc;t&eacute; was saying, about what people <em><strong>wanted</strong></em> their defaults to be.</p>
<p>So this becomes a case where Microsoft loves and respects its customers, and will do whatever that customer prefers.</p>
<p>Until and unless the government's requirements&nbsp;conflict with those cases, in which cases the government wins the DEFAULT case, which unfortunately means the government wins the case for most people...</p>
<p>And the customer is left thinking "<em>hey, it's a buggy Microsoft product, this wouldn't happen with Apple</em>", just as Eric C&ocirc;t&eacute; suggested.</p>
<p>And we only have ourselves to blame.</p>
<p>Because sometimes Microsoft will unfortunately take a government's requirements over its customer's preferences...</p>

<p>Break it down by what the default value is first. Most people seem to want US-English keyboard settings for some reason. The same people want a US-English OS whatever their localized version is. Dunno why. Kinda surprised.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a pretty good chance that 5% in global relates to &gt;50% in Quebec.</p>

There doesn&#39;t have to be an official regulation, there&#39;s a &quot;request&quot; made to change something so someone shuts up (or quiets down a little).</p>

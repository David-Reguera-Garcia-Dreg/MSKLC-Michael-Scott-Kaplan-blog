<p>Dr. Dilan Roshani&nbsp;just sent me a message via the contact link:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;"><strong>Subject</strong>: Non listed language</span></em></p>
<p style="background: #f7f7f7; padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">Thank you for your great blog. I have a rather rare issue using MSKLC to create <br />my custom keyboard. I would like to create a keyboard for Kurdish language but<br />Kurdish in not listed among the predefined languages in MSKLC. The application<br />does not allow me to create keyboard from scratch for a coutume defined<br />language. Do you have any solution to this issue please? There are more that<br />7000 languages in the world and I am not sure why MS application would not<br />allow to define a non listed language. </span></em></p>
<p style="background: #f7f7f7; padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">In my case I am trying to create a Unicode based keyboard for Kurdish language. </span></em></p>

<p>Dr. Roshani,</p>
<p>The very first release of <strong>Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator</strong> (version 1.3) had this limitation.</p>
<p>But with the second release (version 1.4), I removed that restriction.</p>
<p>You can download MSKLC 1.4 for free from <a title="The Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/bb964665">The Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator</a> MSDN launch page.</p>
<p>Once you have it, there are&nbsp;<strong>four</strong> ways to make it a Kurdish keyboard:</p>
<p>1)&nbsp; You can create a Kurdish&nbsp;<strong>custom culture</strong> using .NET 2.0 or better, in which case Kurdish will be on the list of languages to select.</p>
<p>Need more info about custom cultures? See <a title="How to: Create Custom Cultures" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/library/ms172469(v=VS.80).aspx">How to: Create Custom Cultures</a> and/or <a title=".NET Internationalization: The Developer's Guide to Building Global Windows and Web Applications: Chapter 11 - Custom Cultures" href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/15175/NET-Internationalization-The-Developer-s-Guide-to">.NET Internationalization: The Developer's Guide to Building Global Windows and Web Applications: Chapter 11 - Custom Cultures</a>.</p>
<p>Note that you need the custom culture to author the keyboard layout; the people who install the layout do not.</p>
<p>2) You can create a Kurdish <strong>custom locale</strong> using the Microsoft Locale Builder.</p>
<p>For more information on MSLB, see <a title="Enable Global Apps With Locale Builder And Windows Vista" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163506.aspx">Enable Global Apps With Locale Builder And Windows Vista</a>. I forget where the latest published version is, so if no one else knows I guess you can stick with the&nbsp;<strong>custom culture</strong>.</p>
<p>Note that just as with #1m you need the custom&nbsp;locale to author the keyboard layout; the people who install the layout do not.</p>
<p>3) You can install Windows 8, which includes a Kurdish locale on it!</p>
<p>You can base your keyboard on it, and the people who install your keyboard do not have to be running Windows 8.</p>
<p>4) You can download the Kurdish Language Interface Pack from directly in the Language Profile UI.</p>

<p>And then you can check out the keyboard we did, either the optimized one (below)</p>

<p>on the regular one (which you can load into MSKLC!).</p>
<p>Check out our Kurdish LiP, too! :-)</p>
<hr/><p><strong>DilanR</strong> on 8 Apr 2013 2:56 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Thank you Mike, sorry I added some notes some other places as well. I guess I need to target the most users here who are on Windows 7. I have used MSKLC 1.4 for while. When I am about to create installer files, in the project window, I have language selection. I do not have the option to select anything but listed. I have not tried your option #1 which I am going to do now. </p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

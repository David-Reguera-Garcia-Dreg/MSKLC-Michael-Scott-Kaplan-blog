<p>Sometimes in technology we decide to use a word or phrase that isn't very helpful or intuitive on its own.</p>
<p>But then, right as the onlookers seem baffled, you explain it in an easy,&nbsp;intuitive way.</p>
<p>Usually, they're so relieved to understand what's going on that they don't shift into a "why didn't you just call it that in the first place?" :-)</p>
<p>Like the way Windows and the .NET Framework use the word <strong>Ordinal</strong>, something I've mentioned before.</p>
<p>Tell them to use an <strong>Ordinal</strong> function like CompareStringOrdinal, they look confused, so you say "its a <strong>Binary</strong> sort."</p>
<p>Problem solved!</p>
<p>Anyway, now to explain how EAI fits in here.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>people:</strong> What are you working on?<br /><strong>me:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EAI.<br /><strong>people:</strong> Huh?<br /><strong>me:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Email Address Internationalization.<br /><strong>people:</strong> Huh?<br /><strong>me:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You know, Internationalized email. with Unicode characters in the email addresses, etc.<br /><strong>people:</strong> Oh, cool! How's it going?</p>
<p>Calling it EAI kept terms like "International email domains" where they belong.</p>
<p>With the professionals who install, maintain, and support them!</p>
<p>Even so, we still get fooled sometimes....</p>
<p>A couple of days ago and yesterday, several people were passing around an article quite excitedly.</p>
<p>The article was: <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/17/4235724/outlook-com-international-domains-alias">Outlook.com to support 32 new international domains and alias sign in</a></p>
<p>The excitement! Outlook.com supports EAI!</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>Not exactly.</p>
<p>The Outlook Blog, which was that article's cited source, much more accurately explained it in <a title="Outlook.com gets two-step verification, sign-in by alias and new international domains" href="http://blogs.office.com/b/microsoft-outlook/archive/2013/04/17/outlook-com-gets-two-step-verification-sign-in-by-alias-and-new-international-domains.aspx">Outlook.com gets two-step verification, sign-in by alias and new international domains</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;They even included a table of the new domains, which I now steal for you:</p>
<p><img src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/2211.newoutlookcomdomains.png" alt="" width="575" height="843" /></p>
<p>Cool, to be sure. But that ain't EAI....</p>

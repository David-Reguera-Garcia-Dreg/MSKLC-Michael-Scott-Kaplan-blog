<h1>Microsoft Word: 15 -- Microsoft Windows: 0</h1>

<p>Over in the Suggestion Box, Stuart asked:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Someone just posted this image on my Facebook: <a href="https://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/21765_3587733825712_796558586_n.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_new">sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/.../21765_3587733825712_796558586_n.jpg</a></span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">My first reaction was to wonder if it's a real keyboard, and if so, for what country. My second reaction was: I bet I know someone who'd know how to find out!</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">I could probably google the answer to what keyboard that actually is, if any, but it seems like an interesting question in the abstract: given only a picture that shows a small fraction of the keyboard layout, is there some way to find out, either in the documentation or programmatically which keyboard it is?</span></em></p>
<p>The image in question:</p>
<p><img src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/7776.euro.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Now in the past I have posted how the folks who create the actual hardware keyboards (in <strong>Microsoft Hardware</strong>) and the people who own the software layouts in Windows (<strong>me</strong>) are not in the same group.</p>
<p>And that we seldom communicate.</p>
<p>Now in most (perhaps all?)&nbsp;European layouts, the Euro was added to the AltGR+E keystroke combination.</p>
<p>And in <strong>Microsoft Word</strong>, sometimes they override us and insert it there.</p>
<p>And the Euro is quite visible in their <strong>Insert Symbol</strong> UI:</p>
<p><img src="http://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/33/81/3187.euroinword.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>So it does not surprise me that things would be so prominent in the keyboard hardware. Probably most European keyboard hardware has this, today.</p>
<p>Because <strong>Microsoft Word trumps Microsoft Windows</strong>, in this case, at least.</p>
<p>In the hardware sold in Europe.</p>
<p>And in the hearts and minds of most users. :-)</p>
<p>Now I love Windows, but you know what <strong>Love</strong> means in Tennis.</p>
<p>It means <strong>Zero</strong>.</p>
<p>C'mon people! Word sits on top of Windows, so of course it often gets to win.</p>
<p>If your sister is sitting on her brother, she won that fight!</p>

<p>(I know, I know, probably someone just rearranged the keycaps. &nbsp;But is it just possible that this is a real layout?)</p>

<p><strong>Random832</strong> on 25 Mar 2013 8:48 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>There are, in fact, four &#39;interesting&#39; aspects of the keyboard, apart from the obviously-rearranged arrangement of letters:</p>
<p>The Euro on the &quot;E&quot;, as you noted, the presence of a so-called &quot;L-shaped&quot; enter key, the presence of colon above the period, and the presence of } on Altgr-0.</p>

<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 25 Mar 2013 9:55 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>I didn&#39;t miss the point. As I told <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing">my colleague</a>, I was trying to remain above it! :-)</p></div>
<p><strong>Azarien</strong> on 25 Mar 2013 1:20 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Not all European layouts have € on AltGr+E. In Polish this combination was already reserved for ę, so € is on AltGr+U. (for eUro, I suppose)</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 25 Mar 2013 5:06 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Word might screw up on Polish. Windows FTW!</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Richard</strong> on 27 Mar 2013 12:23 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>In the UK, it&#39;s AltGr+4.</p>
<p>But we&#39;re not European. :p</p>

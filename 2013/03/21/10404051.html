<h1>Whither Colemak in Windows 8? In Windows Phone 8?</h1>

<p>If there was ever a persistent force in my universe, it would have to be the Acolytes of Colemak.</p>
<p>No matter how many times they lose their Wikipedia page, and no matter how often I tell them that they will not be added to Windows as long as I own new keyboards, they keep popping back up.</p>
<p>They are Chumba Wumba incarnate (they get knocked down, but they get up again, and you're never gonna keep them down).</p>
<p>They are weeble wobbles personified (they wobble, but they don't fall down).</p>
<p>Just the other day, in an offtopic comment to <strong><a title="Why aren't there any Cherokee keyboard layouts on Windows Phone 8?" href="../07/10398041.html">Why aren't there any Cherokee keyboard layouts on Windows Phone 8?</a></strong>, asdf (presumably not his real name!) asked:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><em>Hey Michael, is there any way to get the Colemak keyboard layout among the built-in layouts in the next Servive Packs for Windows and all future versions of windows (Or at least submit a feature request for it on Microsoft's internal bug database)?</em></span></p>
<p>What on earth does that have to do with Windows Phone 8?</p>
<p>And pardon me, but what the heck kind of genuine Colemak user is named <strong>asdf</strong> anyway?&nbsp;Wouldn't a <em>genuine</em> Colemak user be <strong>arst</strong>?</p>
<p><img src="http://colemak.com/wiki/images/8/80/Colemak_layout_2.png" alt="Colemak_layout_2.png" />&nbsp;</p>
<p>And yet, despite how often they articulate their desires, they aren't very good about rigorously going about that articulation.</p>
<p>Heck, their downloadable Windows version (available <a href="http://colemak.com/wiki/index.php?title=Windows">here</a>) doesn't do what is (arguably) one of the most important defining feature of Colemak: <strong>it does not remap Caps Lock to Backspace!</strong></p>
<p><em>I guess they never figured out how to make KBDUTOOL.EXE remap the CAPS LOCK key, did they?</em> :-)</p>
<p>No OEM or IHV sells a keyboard that has its layout imprinted on its keys.</p>
<p>No national standard in any country for any language uses its layout - <strong>since it is unsuitable for every language</strong>.</p>
<p>And it lacks the punch of the Dvorak layout, which despite being more common is also readily trounced by QWERTY.</p>
<p>I don't know what will happen when Shai Coleman passes on from this mortal coil&nbsp;-- who will be its champion?</p>
<hr/><p><strong>Yuri Khan</strong> on 21 Mar 2013 7:38 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>I use a customized Colemak variant on Linux. It will be better than Dvorak as long as the CUA standard specifies Ctrl+ZXCV as the main editing keys, and itâ€™s better than QWERTY because, well, everything is better than QWERTY.</p>

<p><strong>Markus W.</strong> on 21 Apr 2013 8:05 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>What I do not really get is the following: Why do you think you should prescribe *any* layout at all? I mean I would really like to test colemak myself and decide on my own. IMHO Windows 8 should support arbitrary keyboards simply by letting everyone add xml config files to a special folder. I get mad at statements like &quot;they will not be added to Windows as long as I own new keyboards&quot;. </p>

<p>I have a song running through my head right now - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul_(Not_Constantinople)">Istanbul (Not Constantinople)</a>, the original version recorded by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Four_Lads">The Four Lads</a>:</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/vankaSlfSr0?feature=player_detailpage" frameborder="0" width="640" height="360"></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;The lyrics are something like this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Istanbul was Constantinople<br /> Now it's Istanbul not Constantinople<br /> Been a&nbsp;long time gone<br /> Old Constantinople's still has Turkish delight<br /> On a&nbsp;moonlight night<br /><br /> Every gal in Constantinople<br /> Is a Miss-stanbul, not&nbsp;Constantinople<br /> So if you've date in Constantinople<br /> She'll be waiting in&nbsp;Istanbul<br /><br /> Even old New York was once New Amsterdam<br /> Why they changed&nbsp; it, I can't say<br />&nbsp;<em>People just liked it better that way?</em><br /><br /> [Chorus]<br /> Take me back to Constantinople<br /> No, you can't go back to Constantinople<br /> Now it's Istanbul, not Constantinople<br /> Why did Constantinople get the&nbsp;works?<br /> That's nobody's business but the Turks'<br /><br /> Istanbul!!<br /> Istanbul!!<br /><br /> Even old New York was once New Amsterdam<br /> Why they&nbsp;changed it, I can't say<br /><em>&nbsp;People just liked it better that way?</em><br /><br /> [Chorus]<br /><br /> Istanbul!!</p>
<p>Like I said, it's running through my head now.</p>
<p>Maybe it's running through yours now, too!</p>
<p>You might be wondering why I gifted you so elegantly....</p>
<p>I'll tell you.</p>
<p>As of June 3rd, 2006, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia_and_Montenegro">State Union of Serbia and Montenegro</a>, formerly known as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, decided to not be together anymore.</p>
<p>Gratuitous flag art for Serbia and Montenegro:</p>

<p>And Serbia:</p>

<p>And Montenegro:</p>

<p>But now even all these years later, with Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, both the <strong>Language Pack</strong> and the <strong>Language Interface Pack</strong> go by the name in Microsoft products as:</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;sr-Cyrl-CS</td>
<td>&nbsp;0x0c1a</td>
<td>Serbian - Serbia and Montenegro (Former) (Cyrillic)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;sr-Latn-CS</td>
<td>0x081a&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;Serbian - Serbia and Montenegro (Former) (Latin)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;instead of the new locales created there for this noble purpose:</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>sr-Cyrl-RS</td>
<td>0x281a</td>
<td>Serbian - Serbia (Cyrillic)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>sr-Latn-RS</td>
<td>0x241a</td>
<td>Serbian - Serbia (Latin)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;sr-Cyrl-ME</td>
<td>0x301a&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;Serbian - Montenegro (Cyrillic)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>sr-Latn-ME</td>
<td>0x2c1a</td>
<td>Serbian - Montenegro (Latin)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Although the Constitution of Montenegro recognizes a language known as <strong>Montenegrin</strong>, in an uncommon burst of sanity they decided to recognize that their actual language has always been Serbian</p>
<p>In the future that may change, but for now we'll leave it be.</p>
<p>So instead of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia_and_Montenegro">Serbia and Montenegro</a>, we have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia">Serbia</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montenegro">Montenegro</a>.</p>
<p>For now, the new locales exist, even though the <strong>LP</strong> and the <strong>LIP</strong> don't use them.</p>
<p>I pleaded, a little bit in Windows 7 and a <strong>lot</strong> in Windows 8, but no wanted to take the bait.</p>
<p>I really hope we'll make the change, soon.</p>
<p>One day!</p>
<p>But that song running through my head....</p>
<p>I'll add single quotes to make it easier to navigate:</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">'Serbia' and 'Montenegro' were 'Serbia and Montenegro'</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"> Now it's 'Serbia'&nbsp;or 'Montenegro' not 'Serbia and Montenegro'</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"> Been a&nbsp;long time gone</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"> Old 'Serbia and Montenegro' still has Slavic delight</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"> On a&nbsp;moonlight night</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;"> Every gal in 'Serbia and Montenegro'</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"> Is in 'Serbia'&nbsp;or 'Montenegro', not&nbsp;'Serbia and Montenegro'</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">So if you've date in 'Serbia and Montenegro'</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"> She'll be waiting in&nbsp;'Serbia'.

<p>Kind of catchy, right? :-)</p>
<p>I've been wracking my brains trying to decide whether it's geopolitically offensive or not. Maybe I'll have warble it in the weekly WR PM meeting (aptly named 'the WRPMS meeting'!), and see what they think....</p>
<p>Or maybe I should try to convince my amazing and talented singer/songwriter friend <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holly_Figueroa">Holly Figeuroa</a> to do a cover of it some time? She's a much better singer than I am!&nbsp;:-)</p>
<hr/><p><strong>PastorGL</strong> on 15 Mar 2013 10:44 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Thank you very much, Michael. You found the very good song that I&#39;ve barely remembered from my childhood and wasn&#39;t able to find by myself.</p>

<p><strong>Alex Cohn</strong> on 15 Mar 2013 12:29 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>One major change I found there recently was universal deprecation of the Cyrillic script in Montenegro (coinsiding with the prefrence of the &quot;international&quot; name of the country over the old Црна Гора. I saw Cyrillic script only in cases explicitly promoting political and/or cultural ties with Russia.</p>

<p>My good friend Cathy Wissink sent me email the other day:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I assume you know about this, but if not:</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">&nbsp;<strong>European Computer Manufacturers Association publishes ECMAScript Internationalization API Specification </strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">In December 2012 the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) approved ECMA-402, which helps ECMAScript developers&rsquo;&nbsp; internationalization efforts by specifying&nbsp; string comparison functions for sorting, number, and currency formatting. This new standard complements the ECMAScript language specification (ECMA-262), enabling programmers to sort strings directly within the browser, while supporting the user&rsquo;s chosen language and culture.&nbsp; ECMAScript is the standardized version of JavaScript.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">&nbsp;Mr. Neboj&scaron;a Ćirić, chairman of the ECMAScript internationalization group, says that the &ldquo;..main goals for this specification were to provide uniform and ubiquitous internationalization API for developers, to enable offline processing, and to reduce the download size for localization data.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">Previously,&nbsp; similar functionality required server-based processing, and associated overhead.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">The standard has been developed by Ecma Technical Committee 39, among whose committee members are&nbsp; representatives from Microsoft,&nbsp; Adobe, Google, IBM, and Mozilla.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;">&nbsp;o&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>How to use: Download ECMA-402, ECMAScript Internationalization API Specification</strong> free of charge from the Ecma International website:</span></p>

<p>I had indeed heard&nbsp;of it. The JavaScript in question is the one Microsoft uses in both client and server scenarios.</p>
<p>Glad to hear Microsoft was involved, but I doubt we're going to see anyone updating the scripting libraries.</p>
<p>If they had just done it a few years ago, it&nbsp;would have all been possible...</p>

So I&#39;d expect it to be implemented in IE and therefore, by extension, available in Windows Store HTML/JS applications too.</p>
<p>I believe the Windows Script Host JScript script engine is stuck at ECMAScript 3rd edition, and won&#39;t now be updated. In IE it has of course been replaced by the Chakra JIT compiler.</p>

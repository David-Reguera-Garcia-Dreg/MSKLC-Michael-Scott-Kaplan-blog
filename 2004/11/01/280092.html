<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">PLEASE READ HERE FIRST PRIOR TO CONTACTING ME VIA THE LINK BELOW.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">If you contact me via the link when you were supposed to do something else, then I may not ever respond to you!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">--------------------------------------------------------------</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">A few years ago, I was dating a woman who lived in Los Angeles (well, North Hollywood, actually). She had a great website which is unfortunately no longer available. But on her site, she put a link to her email address, and pointed out that it probably did not make sense to contact her except in case of emergency, like if her homepage was on fire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">At the bottom of this article there is a link that can be used to contact me. So far, it seems that people use it to either (a) suggest possible future topics, (b) get product support, (c) provide feedback to a specific post, or (d) tell people that they think they knew me from way back when (or that they are related to me)....</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">If you are tempted to click on the link for:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">reason (a) then&nbsp;the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">Suggest a Topic</span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">&nbsp;link on the right&nbsp;is a much better place to go. Its my actual "TO DO" list for future posts.</span> </li>
<li><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">reason (b) then </span><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/suzcook/archive/2003/12/05/57253.aspx"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">Suzanne Cook</span></a><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"> said it much&nbsp;more&nbsp;effectively&nbsp;than I ever could.</span> </li>
<li><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">reason (c) then why not add a comment to the posting itself?</span> </li>
<li><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">reason (d) then I guess you can go for it and <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/contact.aspx">click here</a>.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">some other reason entirely than I highly recommend looking elsewhere, I probably won't be able to help you anyway.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">If the page actually is in fact on fire you can contact me, but I probably won't be able to do much.... :-)</span></p>

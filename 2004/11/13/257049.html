<h1>Using MSLU with ATL/WTL</h1>

<P>If you are using the Microsoft Layer for Unicode on Windows 95/98/Me Systems in a project that uses ATL or WTL, there are some things you need to do to make it work.</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<P>Avoid the <B>_ATL_MIN_CRT</B> macro -- this macro appears to be incompatible with MSLU.</P>
<LI>
<P>Problems with garbage text in window title bars -- It is a problem with the usage of <B>::DefWindowProc</B> and <B>::CallWindowProc</B> in ATL and WTL.&nbsp; The way to correct this problem is to at the very start of your program add the following code: <PRE>// Resolve UNICOWS's thunk (required) <BR>::DefWindowProc (NULL, 0, 0, 0); </PRE>
<LI>Tim Smith explained it best: <BR>"The problem is that if you create an ATL window prior to <B>::DefWindowProc</B> being called, then <B>m_pfnSuperWindowProc</B> points to the thunk [in the loader] and not the resolved address.&nbsp; Then when ATL passes <B>m_pfnSuperWindowProc</B> into <B>::CallWindowProc</B> as part of the <B>WM_SETTEXT</B> message, MSLU doesn't realize that it is being passed [its own] <B>::DefWindowProc</B> and thus does an extra level of text conversion.&nbsp; By invoking <B>::DefWindowProc</B> at the start of the program, then when ATL creates a window and stores the address of <B>::DefWindowProc</B> in <B>m_pfnSuperWindowProc</B>, it is storing the address of the MSLU routine that the MSLU <B>::CallWindowProc</B> realizes does not need conversion.&nbsp; In general, if you are using ATL/WTL, just add that line of code at the start of your program and be done with it.&nbsp; It also should be added to any DLL that uses ATL windows [which have the same issue]. 
<P></P>
<P>Please note that the abvove issue has been addressed in <A>WTL 7.0</A> and thus only applies to earlier versions of WTL. </P></LI></UL>

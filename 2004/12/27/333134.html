<P>I have a box of candy in my office, and the two methods that seem most effective in keeping me between 161 and 165 pounds are to (a) try to fill the candy box with candy I do not like but other people do, and (b) not spend too much time at work and instead work from home. The second method is important since I also keep a large fridge filled with <A href="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B0001FR0B6.01-A3OSY57YTXMHNX.LZZZZZZZ.jpg">Limonata</A>&nbsp;and if I am there too much I'll gain weight even without the candy and because other people like to fill the box, too. The&nbsp;first is important because I probably buy the most and I can dilute these other nice people.</P>
<P>Every once in a while I will see something new and I'll buy a bag of something that I have never seen before because I am curious what the hell it is. Most of them will be eaten before I get aroung to trying one and then I'll finally figure out if I liked it or not.</P>
<P>Have you ever had&nbsp;a particular kind of candy that you could not tell if you liked by trying it?</P>
<P>And have you ever found that trying it again later that day or the next day you still weren't sure?</P>
<P>Its probably just me.</P>
<P>Anyway, I haven't decided yet if I like blogs. </P>
<P>I mean, I have been doing this one for two months. I have been trying to post something relevant&nbsp;every day for at a little over a month of that. And at least four of those posts have been interesting. Its hard to sort out in the stats the people who link to you from the people who are just subscribing to hundreds of blogs and are thus not really reading any of this, but I think there are at least 20 people who read it now and again.</P>
<P>Yet, I can't tell if blogs annoy me yet. </P>
<P>I may not know until I can't think of something to post, and at that point I <STRONG>will</STRONG> be annoyed so it probably won't be fair to take <EM>that</EM> impression as an indication of how I feel about a whole technology.</P>
<P><A href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/">Robert Scoble</A> likes them a lot, but I have known him since he worked for Jim Fawcette and he <EM>always</EM> thinks some technology is the coolest thing in the world, and its always non-coinidentally what he is very involved with at the time. I'm not criticizing that, since if nothing else it proves he has convictions and believes in what he is doing/saying - which is a good thing. But its not a good way to get independent advice on what is cool. After all, he used to love the Offramp, too (and proably still does!), and I never really did, even when I used to post there....</P>
<P>Maybe the whole blog opinion thing will come to me one day when I don't suspect it.</P>
<P>Maybe blogs just taste like chicken. And I kind of like chicken. Though not every day....</P>
<P>On the other hand, maybe blogs taste like Limonata. In that case, you can expect about a case of posts every week!</P>

So whenever I check my mail I check for the next interesting tidbit from you two, and it is almost always worthwhile.<br><br>My own blog sits unused, but I hope to get back to it in a few days.  I've been saying that for months, though.  :)  At least I have the excuse that mine's a personal vanity blog.  But yours is quite varied on a number of estoteric topics and I do like it a lot.  I know there have to be others as well.  Just wait until word gets around!</div>

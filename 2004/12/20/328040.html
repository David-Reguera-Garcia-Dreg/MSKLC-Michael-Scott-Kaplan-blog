<P><A href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/clr/bcl/meettheteam/meettheteam.aspx">Anthony Moore</A>,&nbsp;a development lead on the BCL (Base Class Libraries) team of the .NET Framework, has written an excellent <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/BCLTeam/archive/2004/12/20/327702.aspx">summary</A>&nbsp;of many of the issues involved with the parsing and formatting of dates when you add time zones to the mix. The article also has a link there to an entry in the <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/programming/bcl/faq/DateAndTimeFAQ.aspx">Date and Time FAQ</A>, another excellent document with good info in it....</P>
<P>I myself stayed away from the issues&nbsp;surrounding time zones in a recent post about about <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2004/11/26/270769.html">Parse and ParseExact</A>, mainly because I know a lot more about the Windows end of it than the .NET Framework's, and it is truly impossible for me to maintain the illusion of knowing everything if I do not stick to what I know. But if I know people like Anthony then maybe by extension I do know all about time zones in the .NET Framework?</P>
<P>Nah, I don't even buy that one. So I would not encourage you to. But there is a reason that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/BCLTeam/">BCLTeam</A> blog is on the list of Blogs I Read, and if you do things with managed code then you might want to put it on yours....</P>

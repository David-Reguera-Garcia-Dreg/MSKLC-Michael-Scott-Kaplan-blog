<h1>Welcome to <b>Sorting It All Out</b></h1>

<P>Now that I am two months and 21 posts into this blog, I guess it may be time to explain why I am doing this, <A href="http://larkware.com/dg2/thedailygrind510.html">comments</A> from colleagues nonwithstanding. :-)</P>
<P>Sometimes I have felt like I was answering the same question over and over again, whether internally at Microsoft or externally on the newsgroups. That feeling would often make me post less, or more accurately make me a little less likely to post an answer to a question. This is of course not entirely fair to the person asking....</P>
<P>So I started this blog. Now I can answer the question once and then use pointers to those answers. </P>
<P>As a bonus I get to pretend that I am clever and funny (which to whatever extent it is true here is <STRONG>not</STRONG> true in real life except accidentally). If you don't like (or don't care about) what I post one day, then you may like (or care about) what I post the next. Its like the <A href="http://8ball.ofb.net/">Magic 8-Ball</A>.</P>
<P>Now the rule I have set for myself is that preferably every day (or at worst every other day) I should have something to say. Obviously vacations do not apply here, but other than that, hospitalization, or outright committment, if I cannot think of something useful to say at least that often then I will probably retire it. Harsh, I know -- but I gotta be me.</P>
<P>By the way, this post does not count as one that I consider "something to say" since the blog is not about talking about myself. Its about talking about globalization, internationalization, localization, or other topics that deal with software/hardware for the world. And anything I run across along the way....</P>

Just in case you sometimes throw in cookies...<br><br>BTW, talking about you from time to time may not be that bad an idea IMO.</div>

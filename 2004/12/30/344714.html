<h1>Accessible crap advertising</h1>

<P>I have been noticing more and more web sites lately that contain an interesting type of ad. Have you seen any of the following?</P>
<UL>
<LI>Shoot the bug and get&nbsp;a free iPod! 
<LI>Which one is Snoop-Dogg? Answer for a chance at a free Sidekick! 
<LI>Shoot the tank and get a free PS2! 
<LI>Shoot the criminal and get a free Nintendo DS! 
<LI>Who is the pop diva? <EM>(hint from me -- it is not Angelina Jolie or Pamela Anderson)</EM> 
<LI>Shoot the gangster and get a free iPod! 
<LI>And so on, ad infinitum....</LI></UL>
<P>In each of these you are playing a game where you are given an "easy" task (provided you don't believe that Pamela Anderson is a pop diva, of course!). All you have to do is click in a specific small area of the screen making up a small part of an image that is not in the tab index, has no accelerator, has no other keyboard access, and is thus generally unreachable to people who have accessibility issues and are unable to use the mouse.</P>
<P>I must admit that there is a part of me that gets mad any time I see inaccessible UI. Its unfair, its thoughtless, and it discrimates. It sucks.</P>
<P>I am also forced to admit that there&nbsp;is another, larger&nbsp;part of me that is a little jealous of people who can be spared the stupidity of these ads. Its almost like someone is saying to them "I know you have it tough, so we won't force you to deal with the pop-up hell our company wants to give everyone else on the web dumb enough to click here."</P>
<P>All of that is probably crap -- if the lifeless wingnuts who design these Beelzebub's hors d'oeuvres and serve them up on web sites that are so desperate to have the Internet make some money for them finally that they will pimp for the video game system target practice contests were to recognize that there was a whole crowd of suckers who would give them money, then they'd be packaging up a system to deliver the con to them.</P>
<P>Luckily they do not seem to be all too bright.</P>

<p>French to English,</p>
<p>Spanish to English and</p>
<p>Italian to Engligh.</p>
<p>Sadly, none worked.</p>

<P>In French it would be something like 'Hors d'oeuvres de Beelzebub'? :-)</P></div>

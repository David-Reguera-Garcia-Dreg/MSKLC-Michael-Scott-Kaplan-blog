<p>Yes, here is where you can suggest a topic for future coverage by <em>Sorting it all Out</em>. I will allow any item that even remotely&nbsp;makes sense for me to cover, and will probably remove items after they are covered. We'll see how it goes, I am new at this....</p> <p>As people have&nbsp;noticed, I have been putting some of the topics that have been growing on me to write about.... I'll probably keep doing that.</p> <p>(Due to the way the blog server is set up, comments close in 30 days. At that point a new suggestion page gets set up every 30 days, if I don't forget to create a new one. If I do forget, you can send me a reminder via the Contact page!)</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong><font size="4">Older suggestion pages (these suggestions are still "on the list" to happen):</font></strong><br />December 2004 (all topics moved forward)</p>

<h1>Editorial Policy...</h1>

<p>My policy and the policy of this blog is to not make substantive changes to a&nbsp;post. If I make a substantive addition to a post, I will mark it as such. Though that will probably be pretty rare. I will not retroactively try to make myself appear more impressive than I was. Not that I find myself to be particularly impressive (nor do I know of anyone who does), but just in case....</p> <p>With that said, I have (and will continue to) make small changes to fix typos and broken links. I will likely not give a sign of having done such minor editorial changes, it just seems silly to bother.</p> <p>The contents of this article are going to make me unpopular with some blog "true-believers" who look at blogs as a static "slice of life" that should never be modified. But that's <em>their</em> problem -- and their issue. I have to be me, even if I am using a different means of communication. I guess I have to misquote one of Milos Forman's movies -- if you don't like <strong>Sorting It All Out</strong> then don't read it. But if you do, or if you have constructive suggestions about topics or thoughts about topics posted then I would love to hear from you. :-)</p>

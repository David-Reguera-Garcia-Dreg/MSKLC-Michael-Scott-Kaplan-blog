<P>The question was deceptively simple:</P>

<P><FONT face="times new roman,times">I used all three and I find ToLower() to be fastest .But the Msdn article says that ToLowerInvariant should be faster. </FONT><A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.string.tolowerinvariant(VS.85).aspx"><FONT face="times new roman,times">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.string.tolowerinvariant(VS.85).aspx</FONT></A><FONT face="times new roman,times"> . <BR>Which one is better with respect to performance. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times">Results are ,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="times new roman,times">173ms ToLower<BR>260ms ToLowerInvariant<BR>265ms ToLowerCultureInfoInvariant</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The results seem okay to me, it is the link that is off a bit....</P>
<P>It is a matter of where/how you aim expectations.</P>
<P>You see, starting in .Net 2.0 (and subsequent versions), "invariant" casing actually means "use the operating system casing results" and also "don't do those weird linguistic results".</P>
<P>Thus just using ToLower() will cause you to miss hundreds of characters being mapped, and it will map some characters likely best left alone.</P>
<P>Performance is&nbsp;one reasonable axis to use for the judging of results, but correctness is, too, right?</P>
<P>The ad campaign "ToLower may be wrongest, but at least it can be fastest!" is unlikely to be as effective as that 5-year old using Windows 7. :-)</P>

<P>What would ToLower() miss? And which characters are likely best left alone?</P>
<P>Aren't some languages more affected than others?</P></div>

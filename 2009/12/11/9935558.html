<h1>The jury may still be out on this one, Part 0</h1>

<P>Jury duty is not something I have really been in the habit of consciously avoiding.</P>
<P>And yet despite having appeared ready to serve on many a jury in the ~7745&nbsp;days&nbsp;since my 18th birthday, I have never been asked to deliberate on any case being tried before a jury.</P>
<P>Sometimes I wait and never end up being selected at all, sometimes I am excused for cause by one of the attorneys, and on two occasions I was excused by peremptory challenges (some attorney thought I'd be bad for them on the panel I suppose).</P>
<P>The most recent prior summons, I wrote about a year ago last April in <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/04/06/8362341.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/04/06/8362341.html"><STRONG>How to avoid jury duty without feeling guilty or offended?</STRONG></A>, and you can see how simply asking about accessibility led them to excuse me.</P>
<P>Anyway, I have another jury summons, this one for the week after next.</P>
<P>And I am going to simply go this time.</P>
<P>If things are not totally accessible, then that's fine -- the iBot can help make up for it.</P>
<P>Now I have a sneaking suspicion that I will end up not serving once I show up (for all kinds of reasons, you can guess what they may be but only some of them relate to the iBot -- other reasons like my extensive history of seeing every episode of every franchise of Law &amp; Order might make one of <STRONG>those</STRONG> people), but I am going to do my best to try. As the summons mentions, <STRONG>jury service is one of the fundamental rights, privileges, and duties of participation in a democratic society.</STRONG></P>
<P>When the whole thing is done, I'll blog about the experience, however it turns out. Including how the iBot fares....</P>

<p>A regular reader gave me an interesting problem, from a book. </p><p>If that kind of puzzle is not your thing feel free to ignore....</p><p>Here is the text, from a book, that describes the setup for the problem:</p><blockquote><p><font face="times new roman,times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behind them in the billiard room a man's voice grumbled, "Damn kid's game. Not a man's game in the place." The speaker intruded his wide shoulders between Ish and Joshua; a big man dressed in black clothing a bit too dandified for a rancher, a knight's head stickpin glinting in the dark silk of his cravat. The smell of whiskey hung faintly around him, but there was, too, an edge of danger, a readiness for trouble that said, Gunfighter.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the blackjack table, Jason leaned forward his red-and-gold waistcoat bright as blood against the white of his sleeves. He looked at his cards, leaned back, and folded.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behind them, the big mn grumbled, "About as much skill and thinking as Faro. Spit in the Ocean! Acey-Ducey Under-My-Shoosie! Doesn't anybody in this Godfersaken hell play chess?"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without so much as turning his head, Ishmael inquired, "At how much a piece?"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mate was set at two hundred dollars. Queen went for a hundred ("About the price of any woman in this town," remarked someone), rooks seventy-five, bishops and knights fifty. Pawns were twenty dollars a piece. A mystified owner scoured the surrounding saloons for a chess set and finally came up with one that the owner of Florinda's Place kept for decoration in her parlor.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ishmael beat the stranger in seven moves.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "By God!" roared the big man. "Let me see you try that again, stranger!:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He caught him with a reverse fool's mate, in three.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But that," he said, pocketing his cash, "is a classic fakement."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The big man stroked his narrow black mustache and regarded his closed-in king thoughtfully through a haze of cigar smoke. Then he looked back up at Ish. "After I beat you this time," he said, "show me that one again."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Warned, stung and $600 poorer, the gunfighter settled down to grim play...."</font><br></p></blockquote><p>Things you should keep in mind:</p><ul><li>The book contains no additional relevant information that will help solve the problem; it is a good read but the read will not help you;<br></li><li>If you don't know about chess then you shouldn't bother;</li><li>Author Barbara Hambly is disqualified from being allowed to answer.<br></li></ul><p>The questions that you must answer to solve the problem:</p><ol><li>Is the $600 a true calculation based on two actual possible chess games?</li><li>If the answer to #1 is yes, who was black and who was white in each game?</li><li>If the answer to #1 is yes, what would be an exact sequences of moves in each game to cause the $600 cost of the two games?</li><li>If the answer to #1 is yes, are there other potential sequences that could fit all of the known facts given in the problem?</li></ol><p>It took me a bit longer to wok this one out than I would have liked, but I have been out of practice as I have not played chess in well over 15 years and have not played speed chess in almost half as long.</p><p>The prize? </p><p>I'll be very impressed if you solve the problem, even moreso if you beat my time, but most of all if you beat the time I feel I should have solved it in....</p><p>Ready? Set? Go!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><font color="#ff00ff">The Unicode characters were released from

<hr/><p><strong>annoym</strong> on 13 Apr 2009 5:53 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Fool's mate, also known as the &quot;two-move checkmate,&quot; is the quickest possible checkmate in the game of chess. One example consists of the moves</p>
<p>1. f3 e5 </p>
<p>2. g4 Qh4# </p>
<p>so,perhaps,the first game cost 400$ and the second cost 200$</p></div>
<p><strong>akoltz</strong> on 15 Apr 2009 6:58 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>The answer to question #1 is &quot;no.&quot;</p>
<p>I'm done, 3 seconds.</p>
<p>Did I win?</p></div>
<p><strong>Maurits [MSFT]</strong> on 18 Apr 2009 12:07 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Well, let's think this thing out. &nbsp;The second game was a reverse fool's mate in three moves, which is quite a bit of information:</p>
<p>1) the game ended in mate.</p>
<p>2) since the shortest mate takes four half-moves, the term "moves" here refers to the standard chess meaning and not the colloquial "half-move" meaning.</p>
<p>3) the "reverse" implies that White won (Black wins the regular Fool's mate.)</p>
<p>4) Black has no time to capture anything.</p>
<p>5) White has time to capture at most one thing, and that would have to be a pawn.</p>
<p>So there are only a couple of possibilities for the second game.</p>
<p>-- GAME TWO, MATE PLUS A PAWN --</p>
<p>1. e4 f5?</p>
<p>2. exf5 g5??</p>
<p>3. Qh5# - white wins $220</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>-- GAME TWO, BLOODLESS MATE --</p>
<p>There are various different ways to do this.</p>
<p>1. e3 g5</p>
<p>2. Nc3 f6??</p>
<p>3. Qh5# - white wins $200</p>
<p>So we know Ishmael was White in the second game. &nbsp;If the convention of alternating colors was followed, it's likely but not certain that Ishmael was Black in the first game.</p>
<p>We're given that the first game lasted seven moves, and that Ishmael's total net was $600; so he netted either $400 or $380 in the first game, depending on whether he got a pawn in the first game.</p>
<p>The word "beat" strongly suggests mate although the stranger could have resigned - both possibilities are worth exploring.</p>
<p>Exploring...</p></div>
<p><strong>Maurits [MSFT]</strong> on 18 Apr 2009 1:12 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>The length of the first game is quite substantial. &nbsp;There are sample games that work with a possible second game that are shorter than seven moves, so I suspect that there are multiple solutions.</p>
<p>To get $400, for example, one possibility is for Ishmael to get mate + queen + knight + bishop. &nbsp;To get $380, one possibility is for Ishmael to get queen + knight + bishop and the stranger to get a pawn.</p>
<p>Sample game (with Ishmael as Black) taking only five moves, leaving two additional moves for fooling around.</p>
<p>1. Nh3 d5</p>
<p>2. b3 Qd6</p>
<p>3. Ba3 Qxa3</p>
<p>4. Qc1 Bxh3</p>
<p>5. Rg1 Qxc1#</p>
<p>Pair this with the bloodless mate and you have a solution. &nbsp;Inject 1 ... g5 2. Nxg5 and pair it with the mate + a pawn and you have a different solution.</p></div>
<p><strong>Maurits [MSFT]</strong> on 23 Apr 2009 11:21 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>There are also totally different possible first games involving Ishmael getting mate + queen + four pawns (the last moves being 7. Kf1 Qxf2#)</p></div>

<p>I'd say you get the job, though you already have it. So I guess that means you get to keep your job! :-)</p>

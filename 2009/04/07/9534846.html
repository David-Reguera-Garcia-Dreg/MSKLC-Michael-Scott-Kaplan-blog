<p>It was just this last Sunday that long time reader Yuhong Bao wrote over in the Suggestion Box:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><font face="times new roman,times">BTW, someone mistyped DBCS as Double Bite Character Sets:</font></i></p>

<p><i><font face="times new roman,times"><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=0e56788b-32e8-459d-b9c9-b9155a4836b4" target="_new" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=0e56788b-32e8-459d-b9c9-b9155a4836b4</a></font></i></p>

<p><i><font face="times new roman,times">I was wondering if DBCS is really that painful.</font></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interesting question, no? :-) </p>
<p>In case someone fixes the bug, here is the screenshot from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=0e56788b-32e8-459d-b9c9-b9155a4836b4&amp;displaylang=en" mce_href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=0e56788b-32e8-459d-b9c9-b9155a4836b4&amp;displaylang=en">Update for Windows XP (KB961503)</a>:<br></p>
<p><img src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/dbcs.jpg" border="2" width="506" height="76"></p>
<p>The KB article (<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=961503" mce_href="http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=961503">961503: You cannot input characters as expected by using a non-English Input Method Editor in Windows Live Messenger on a Windows XP-based computer</a>) does not have this problem, as it does not mention either BYTE or BITE. It is just the download page.<br></p>
<p>There are those who would claim that DBCS does at times bite.</p>
<p>So perhaps it is amusing to think of this as a Freudian slip of some sort.</p>
<p>Though I suspect it to be more likely either a simple typo or one of those "typed by someone who does not understand after being briefed by someone who does" kind of situations....</p><p>Or maybe it is an unexpected example of someone making the mistake I described in <b><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/02/21/7837478.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/02/21/7837478.html">We're back and we're embarrassing ourselves? (aka Making your localizer's life easier, Part 2)</a></b> about how people try to spell out acronyms to avoid confuson:</p><blockquote><p><font face="times new roman,times">And the guidelines themselves often fail to assist: for example, in 
documentation on the first occurrence of an acronym one is expected to spell out 
the acronym. But if one finds <b>GDI</b> confusing one is unlikely to 
find <b>GRAPHICS DEVICE INTERFACE</b> to be the magical road to 
understanding. In fact, the guidelines can often increase confusion!</font> <br></p></blockquote><p>Even if the person doing it did not know what it really stood for!<br></p>
<p>Thinking back to the days of</p>
<ul>
<li>Single byte character set (SBCS)</li>
<li>Multibyte character set (MBCS)</li>
<li>Double byte character set (DBCS)</li>
</ul>
<p>I really do remember times that I really felt like saying (or even screaming) <b>THIS BITES</b> so there is a part of me that is inspired by the "Freudian slip" explanation. :-)</p>
<p>Using Unicode is always easier. Always.</p><p>So maybe we should all treat the <b>B</b> in SBCS, MBCS, and DBCS as <b>BITE&nbsp; </b>rather than <b>BYTE</b>. :-)<br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><i><font color="#ff00ff">The Unicode characters were released from their original contracts when SiaO went an hiatus; only time will tell if the Characters Union (AFL-CIO) is willing to negotiate new contracts for the characters it represents...</font></i><br></p>

<p><strong>Yuhong Bao</strong> on 11 Apr 2009 11:16 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>&quot;In case someone fixes the bug&quot;</p>
<p>It did get fixed, look at the current download page.</p></div>
<p><strong>Yuhong Bao</strong> on 11 Apr 2009 11:37 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>&quot;There are those who would claim that DBCS does at times bite.&quot;</p>
<p>For example, look at the bug itself. Any chance it could be related to DBCS troubles?</p></div>
<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 13 Apr 2009 2:43 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Possibly, but not necessarily. Someone would have to dig in there, it is more likely to be keyboard special handling code that does not take the IME into account. In this case DBCS is often the &quot;ghetto&quot; way of referring to CJK....</p>

<p><strong>Yuhong Bao</strong> on 23 Apr 2009 6:13 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>You mistyped &quot;DLL Help&quot; as &quot;DLL Hell&quot; in another blog post:</p>

<p><strong>Michael S.

Most people who used it before use the old name....</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Yuhong Bao</strong> on 11 Oct 2010 7:54 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Note that some DBCS character sets are less painful than others. For example, some DBCS character sets (like the Windows codepages) uses the ASCII range for the trail byte which include characters like backslash and brackets, while others (like the EUC series) stick with the extended ASCII range.</p>

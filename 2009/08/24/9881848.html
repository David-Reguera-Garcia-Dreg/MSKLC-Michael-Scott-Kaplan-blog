<h1>No Welsh puns here. Ever. Not even a little one. Not at all...</h1>

<p>I have the feeling that certain questions are going to keep getting asked.</p><p>Some in person, like "What's up with your facebook profile pictures?" <br></p><p>Or others via email, like the one about people not feeling like a code page selection is right for a particular locale.</p><p>Just the other day, the question came in like this:</p><blockquote><p><i><font face="times new roman,times">Hi,<br><br>We have been trying to use Welsh and found that the NLS table (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/goglobal/bb896001.aspx) maps Welsh to codepage 1252.<br><br>This has confused me because Welsh can contain Ux0174 (and others) that are not in 1252. (http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/handson/user/welsh.mspx)<br><br>Is there going to be any changes to this mapping to create a Welsh codepage, or an equivilent of Celtic?<br><br>Thanks<br><br>Stephen Cornes</font></i><br></p></blockquote><p>Now admittedly this is not the same case as <b><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2009/08/17/9871988.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2009/08/17/9871988.html">On not looking at Uyghur through a Chinese prism</a></b> where the question is framed in a way that suggests ignoring a language's concerns and requirements in order to fulfill a particular market's. In those kinds of cases, it is easier to pitch Microsoft as the good guy, doing its best. And it doesn't feel like marketing spin to me.</p><p>Plus I was in the meetings where this one was decided, and a lot of careful and thoughtful conversations and even arguments happened; only technical issues were raised, as far as I can recall, the "spin" issue didn't come up.</p><p>But the Welsh case is slightly different, since the desire is purely to want the best language support. And a pretty direct, honest question.</p><p>Sure, code pages aren't enough, I've said so often enough before (like in <b><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/03/31/404370.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/03/31/404370.html">this</a></b> blog). But why wouldn't a better choice be made? Perhaps one including Ŵ (U+0174, aka LATIN CAPITAL LETTER W WITH CIRCUMFLEX).<br></p><p>In this case, there are several facts conspiring against Welsh:</p><ol><li>There is no better code page available to choose from with better coverage;</li><li>We are no longer creating new code pages;</li><li>We can't change the code page, ever. Never. Not even a little but. Not at all.</li></ol><p>This one feels like much more of a "saved by the bell" issue (the excuse sense, not the television show sense) because the policies block the action.</p><p>Whew?</p><p>Of course this is not always the case, and I'll give an example of that next time....</p><p>But for now if you use Unicode then all of the letters in Welsh are supported -- so once again I say just use Unicode!<br>

<p>Okay, now tell me the history of CP950, CP951, HKGCCS and HKSCS.</p></div>
<p><strong>John Cowan</strong> on 24 Aug 2009 11:14 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>ISO 8859-14 handles the Celtic languages, and Ŵ and ŵ are mapped to D0 and F0 respectively, replacing &#208; and &#240;. &nbsp;This would be code page 28604 if it existed, between 28603 = ISO 8859-13 and 28605 = ISO 8859-15.</p>
<p>For all the help that is.</p></div>

<p>That makes me wonder how the Euro symbol got retrofitted into some code pages, including (at least) 1252 -- what kind of approval process and arduous backwards-compatibility discussions were required before they could be changed.</p></div>
<p><strong>Random832</strong> on 25 Aug 2009 9:02 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>So was the &quot;can't change the code page. ever.&quot; policy not yet in place when the Euro was added?</p>
<p>Of course, there are only five unused positions in CP1252 anyway.</p></div>
<p><strong>Michael S.

<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 25 Aug 2009 4:21 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Michael and John -- I was referring to no such code pages on Windows. There are code pages for Georgian out there if you look hard enough; Microsoft isn't adding them every time an ISO committee wakes up and tries to get people off needing Unicode....</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 25 Aug 2009 4:25 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Hey Random832 and pne -- The thing with the Euro I mentioned <b><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/07/04/3697289.html">here</a></b>; it is in fact one of the reasons the policy EXISTS (the aftermath of that change and the problems it caused).</p></div>
<p><strong>John Cowan</strong> on 12 Sep 2009 7:59 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Anybody can devise a coded character set, and many have. &nbsp;But *code pages* are from IBM and Microsoft and nobody else, so if one of you doesn't allocate 28604, then it remains unallocated. &nbsp;But you could.</p></div>
<p><strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 12 Sep 2009 10:21 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><P>Except that bleeding policy thing keeps rearing its head!</P></div>
<p><strong>Yuhong Bao</strong> on 24 Jan 2011 11:02 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>The funny thing is that ISO 8859-14 is from 1998, around the time when the Euro sign was added.</p>

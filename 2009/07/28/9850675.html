</ul>
<p>Now once again, keep in mind that for most of the German speaking world this <b>still</b> isn't a letter....</p>So Windows 7, which once again (just like in Vista) was made to be updated to the most recent version of Unicode it could, LATIN CAPITAL LETTER SHARP S needed to be integrated. <p>Let's take a look at in WordPad, using the Segoe UI font:</p><p><img src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/sharps1.jpg"></p><p>Ok, interesting. Obviously they couldn't make it much taller. So they made it a little wider and left it at that.</p><p>I think that is probably what Unicode did too. </p><p>Makes me wonder what happened in Character Map. Let's take a look:</p><p><img src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/sharps2.jpg">&nbsp; <img src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/sharps3.jpg"></p><p>Hmm... Undefined? Oh I guess someone forgot to regenerate the list of names that Charmap uses. Luckily it can still display characters even when it doesn't know what they are. </p><p>Any testers want to put that bug in? :-) <br></p><p>You know I kind of wonder what they did for fonts that can't change the width.</p><p>Let's take a look at Consolas:</p><p><img src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/sharps4.jpg"></p><p>It's not there. </p><p>Oh damn, let's look at some other fonts, too.</p><p>Like Tahoma:</p><p><img src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/sharps5.jpg"></p><p>and Microsoft Sans Serif:</p><p><img src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/sharps6.jpg"> </p><p>and the fixed width font that is in the font link chain, Courier New:</p><p><img src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/sharps7.jpg">&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;And I am sincerely curious what the upper and lower case look like next to each other on that one. Let's take a look:<br></p><p><img src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/sharps8.jpg"> </p><p>Interesting!</p><p>And it does meet the fixed width rules -- notices how the surrounding text lines up?</p><p>Though it makes me wonder what might have changed from the old font's lowercase character. Just a little bit curious....</p><p>Okay, so Courier New has it, yet Consolas does not.</p><p>Uh oh -- is this a C* font thing?</p><p>Let's look at Calibri, the default font in WordPad:</p><p><img src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/sharps9.jpg"></p><p>Crap.</p><p>Notice how RichEdit doesn't seem to be looking very hard for the substitute. Thank goodness Word is not this lazy!</p><p>How about everyone's favorite uber-font, Arial Unicode MS?</p><p><img src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/sharps10.jpg"> </p><p>Double crap.</p><p>Or maybe we'll get another 20 or 30 people who will agree with me that <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/07/15/3890144.html" style="font-weight: bold;" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/07/15/3890144.html">Arial Unicode MS effectively [bites|sucks|blows]</a>. </p><p>Silver lining of a sort.... <br></p><p>On last font I want to check out though.</p><p>Times New Roman:</p><p><img src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/sharps11.jpg">&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/sharps12.jpg"></p><p>Wow, I think I like this one best -- this is on I can really tell the difference on. Much more than the others. Truly.</p><p>Okay, let's move on, there is kind of a pattern and kind of a logic here. I'm happy. Well, as happy as I can be about a letter that doesn't really exist in the first place....<br></p><p>But just wait until tomorrow when I do part 2 of this blog. :-)<br></p>

<p>But what's more important is that the collation algorithms seem to process "áºž" right. At least in explorer with filenames.</p>

<p>It feels a bit tricky.</p>
<p>I think the mapping should be to &quot;SS&quot;, at least for the German locale.</p>
<p>But Ubuntu is limited by the design of the POSIX API, which does the case conversion in place.</p>
<p>I would really like a mapping to &quot;SS&quot; in public case conversion API, the way ICU (and Mac OS) do. That is what the (German) users expect.</p></div>

<p>Yes, it might make sense because the API is crippled (like the POSIX one). But as an API consumer I would want what my client wants: proper linguistic behavior.</p>
<p>So I would want a non-simple casing API, mapping to SS, like ICU.</p></div>

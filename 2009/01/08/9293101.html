<p>It recently occurred to me that I don't need to keep continuing the <b><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/12/20/9243392.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2008/12/20/9243392.html">I SCOOT to iBOT</a></b> blog series under that name, since I have a category now. :-)</p><p>I mean, it has been a while since I have had any real comparisons or contrasts with the scooter.</p><p>Although recently I had the pleasure of asking my insurance company about the rules for the scooters -- since I have a friend whose brother might really benefit from it were it not for the fact that his insurance company probably wouldn't cover it. I wanted to make sure I was not committing insurance fraud if I gave it to him.</p><p>Her exact words?</p><p>"You wouldn't even be committing insurance fraud if you <i>sold</i> it to him. Once we give it to you then its yours to do with as you will."</p><p>Now I am mildly ashamed to admit that my first thought was about the check made out to me for $26,100 that I endorsed over to Independence Technology. Though even had I known I still wouldn't have pocketed the cash -- I am finding the iBOT to way too useful, way too empowering, way too life-altering to want to go down the road of trying to make money instead.</p><p>It was just a momentary thought as one more weirdness of insurance companies was explained to me. :-)</p><p>If my friend's brother can use the scooter I'll just give it to him, I don't need to make money off my friends or their family. Better to just be helpful!</p><p>Amazingly enough, the above is not what this blog you are reading is about,</p><p>Everything until now has just been an "Aimee Mann on stage" style digression, something that happens from time to time.</p><p>This blog is about what happens in a few hours.</p><p>I am taking a few vacation days, going to Las Vegas. Not for work, for a trade show (I am kind of an invited expert or something like that).</p><p>But that isn't the cool part. Or at least not the cool part I'm talking about here.<br></p><p>This is:</p><p>It is my first time traveling with the iBOT!</p><p>I am flying there and going until Sunday night via the iBOT the whole time, presumably much of that time in Balance mode.</p><p>I'll try and get some pictures, and I'll be writing about whatever iBOT experiences I have from the beginning of the trip until I am back in my apartment again.</p><p>You may wonder if I am nervous about this, and I think I am, a little. But I am mostly very excited.<br></p><p>Armed with some clothes, a toothbrush, a MacBook Pro, a Zune, and an iBOT, I'll be taking said iBOT out on its maiden out-of-town voyage....</p><p><span class="inline inline-right"><img src="http://inventorspot.com/files/images/ibot.img_assist_custom.gif" class="image image-img_assist_custom" title="" alt="" width="288" height="388"></span>&nbsp; <br></p><p>I'll probably blog a bit from there when I have time, and I'll tell people if anything interesting or exciting happens with the iBOT....</p><p>If you are in Vegas and you see a guy in two wheels in wheelchair, check the license plate -- it might be me! :-) <br></p><p><br></p><p><font face="Tahoma"><font color="#ff00ff"><i>This post brought to you by</i><font size="7"> </font><font size="7">♿ </font></font><i><font color="#ff00ff">(</font><a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/267f" class="" mce_href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/267f">U+267f</a><font color="#ff00ff">, a.k.a.

<p>Closer to the end of the 5 years I'll start worrying more!</p>

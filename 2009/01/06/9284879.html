<p>Regular reader Pavanaja U B asked over in the Suggestion Box:</p><blockquote><p><i><font face="times new roman,times">In Word 2003 and prior, there was an option "not to display the font name in that font". This was very useful while using hacked non-English TTF fonts which were using the ASCII codes meant for English for chars/glyphs other than English. This featture is not found in Word 2007. Is there some way to do that in Word 2007?<br><br>TIA.<br><br>-Pavanaja</font></i><br></p></blockquote><p>In case you aren't sure what option he is referring to, I'll show it in Word 2003.</p><p>If you look at the font list, each font uses the actual font to display the name:</p><p><img src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/fontlist02.jpg"> </p><p>You can go to the <b><u>T</u>ools</b> menu:</p><p><img src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/fontlist00.jpg"> </p><p>and choose <b>Tools | <u>C</u>ustomize...</b>.</p><p>From there go to the <b><u>O</u>ptions</b> tab:</p><p><img src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/fontlist01.jpg"></p><p>If you unclick the <b>List <u>f</u>ont names in their font</b> checkbox.</p><p>Once you do that, the font list shows up with just one font used:</p><p><img src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/fontlist03.jpg"></p><p>Ok, cool.</p><p>Now for most people this is just a performance optimization (slower machines with a huge number of fonts found this option to be pretty important).</p><p>If you are in the situation Pavanaja is talking about where you have a font that puts characters on top of the ASCII letters, this feature becomes much more important though -- since the font name will look like gibberish (possibly semi-readable gibberish if the font's mappings are phonetic, but pretty much gibberish nevertheless.</p><p>Unfortunately, sometimes it takes more than a feature to be useful to keep it from getting taken out of the product.<br></p><p>And this feature has been removed from Word 2007.</p><p>As a workaround, you can launch the large Choose Font dialog provided by Word 2007 by hitting <b>CTRL+D</b>. </p><p><img src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/fontlist04.jpg"></p><p>The font list in this dialog does not use the fonts themselves like the list in the ribbon does.</p><p>This is obviously less than ideal since it ignores the ribbon and all, but we do what we must.</p><p>This whole issue, and this feature (which has become the only way to do stuff in Word 2007), puts a whole new spin on the issue I mentioned in <b><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/11/15/6264439.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2007/11/15/6264439.html">'But there's no Latins in our Divehi font, Duckman.' 'Well, they don't *speak* Latin in the Maldives, do they?'</a></b>, since clearly the only thing worse than not including Latins in a font is including something else masquerading as Latins. Some features just get too confused....</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><font color="#ff00ff"><i>This post brought to you by</i><font size="7"> ﬁù

<p>For OpenType PS (.otf) fonts, things look different. One can put a 3.0 cmap into such a font but the font won't work. There is in fact to &quot;proper&quot; (i.e. specification-conforming) way to create a &quot;Symbol&quot; OpenType PS font. </p></div>

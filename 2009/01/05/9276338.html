<p>And I am back, after my end of the year "vacation" from blogging.</p><p>I hope you didn't miss me too much.</p><p>You may not have even noticed I was gone. This is not a bad thing.</p><p>I was in a meeting a few weeks ago with a colleague of mine, and we were talking about a particular blog post that had cheesed off someone or other. And he paused to say, almost self-consciously, that he really hadn't ever seen my blog before.</p><p>Which is not a shock to me -- billions of people in the world, I imagine the percentage of people who have even heard of this blog would be pretty small. There is no reason why anyone should have to read it,...</p><p>Truly.</p><p>You don't even have to feel guilty if you haven't read it lately. If there is something you ought to see I'll probably tell you about it anyway.</p><p>Like the old friend from back when I was in high school who I'm having lunch with tomorrow (assuming the weather does not force us to reschedule; we are kind of retarded here about rain and such). I'll be shocked of she has even heard of this blog, let alone read it. We are pretty obscure here, even when we do stay on topic (which I will, starting with the next blog I write, which I know for sire is true because I have actually already written it!).<br></p><p>Anyway, I had put together a poem I was writing, to set up a huge joke -- the joke in the title.</p><p>It was about a woman baring her soul for her audience in a musical performance.</p><p>Everyone was just mesmerized at the naked display of emotion and how much she was revealing about herself.</p><p>And then at the climax of the song, everyone fell silent.</p><p>They were all shocked speechless, you see.</p><p>You could have heard a pin drop. <br></p><p>Because her G-string broke.</p><p><img src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/brokenfourthstring.jpg" width="600" height="450"></p><p>But the poem was pretty rough and as i tried to clean it up I realized the joke really wasn't that funny.</p><p>So I kind of stopped.<br></p><p>I was showing this blog to someone who was convinced the picture was wrong, that it wasn't the G-string that was broken. He even showed my web pages to prove it and then suriously looked around till he found a non-standard tuning (I think it was the EADGCF that Stanley Jordan used).</p><p>So I had to explain that those chords are written from the bottom up, so he did not have scour the Internet looking for a tuning with a G as the fourth note; the regular old EBGDAE in standard tuning works just fine.</p><p>Never mind the fact that I doubt Stasnley Jordan's style of playing would work well on the above guitar anyway -- his research was simultaneously such an impressive and asinine feat that I hated to kill it with a minor flaw when I had the major one to embarass him with. :-)</p><p>Anyway, so you can imagine the poem was very clever and funny and endearing with a great smile at the end since that was the direction I was aiming. </p><p>If you do that then it saves me the trouble of inspiring all that. Next time, when I have a more worthy topic, I'll do the work....</p><p>Welcome back to <b>Sorting it all Out</b>! </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><font color="#ff00ff"><i>This blog brought to you by</i><font size="7"> G </font><i>(<a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0047" mce_href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0047">U+0047</a>, aka LATIN CAPITAL LETTER G)</i></font> <br></p>

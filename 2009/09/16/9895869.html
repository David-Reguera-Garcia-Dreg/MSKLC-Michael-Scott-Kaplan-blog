<P>The other day, in <A href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2009/09/08/9891892.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2009/09/08/9891892.html"><STRONG>"What kind of soup?" is not exactly a soup question, is it?</STRONG></A>, I mentioned that I might have a technical example of the issue of</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=5>Not exactly a soup question, is it?</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>so think of this blog as me finally getting around to doing that.</P>
<P>It has to do with triage.</P>
<P>World-ready triage, to be precise.</P>
<P>It is a group that in most cases met twice a week, and worked to go through every bug in Windows that had some kind of globalization/localizability/international kind of issue and give a recommendation on how important it was to fix it, and by when.</P>
<P>It was pretty important in terms of the fact that a "must fix" recommendation could not be ignored, and it dovetailed nicely into my actual work of assisting other teams with their globalization/localizability/international issues since often a team that did not know exactly how to fix such an issue would benefit from someone who could work with them on how they could!</P>
<P>But I am not going to talk about the fixing so much in this blog.</P>
<P>This blog is about the triage.</P>
<P>The group&nbsp;included experts in a wide number of specialties -- development, test, and program management, for one. But also people specializing in lots of different areas, like:</P>
<UL>
<LI>bidirectional scripts</LI>
<LI>globalization</LI>
<LI>localizability</LI>
<LI>pseudo localization</LI>
<LI>geopolitical issues</LI>
<LI>localization</LI></UL>
<P>and so on. The number of people would vary from me meeting to meeting, with bugs sometimes skipped to the next meeting if the best people to look at a particular bug report weren't in the room.</P>
<P>A tight little group, very efficient in <EM>almost</EM> every way.</P>
<P>Ironically, the one place they sometimes fell short was due to the very thing that got them the seat at the table --&nbsp;their various/varied ares of interests and areas of expertise!</P>
<P>Because they had those interests, they would often be interested in bug details such as looking deeper&nbsp;into the description, checking out provide screen shots, asking for more information, and so on.</P>
<P>Here is the kicker -- they would want to do some of these things even if it would in no way change the recommendation of triage.</P>
<P>And if one measures efficiency of a triaging group in terms of how fast they go through bugs (so that they can get through more bugs in a meeting) then the fact that members would so often ask questions not relevant to everyone in the room -- <STRONG>that were not soup questions</STRONG> -- could really affect that efficiency.</P>
<P>Now I myself was at times guilty of the same problem, and it was an effort of will to remember that</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>If it isn't a soup question for the meeting to keep it out of the meeting!</STRONG></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Now with Windows 7 out the door and me working on something else now (though I do not know what, yet!), I my not be, in fact probably won't be, in that meeting anymore.</P>
<P>But I do know that if I were I would want to be better to keep those non-soup questions the hell out! :-)</P>

<P><FONT size=6>Unleash the Power of OneNote</FONT></P>
<P>This is the title of a book that I just got sent, by FedEx.</P>
<P>It took me a minute to understand why, though -- I did not remember ordering it, and it has been many years since I have had enough alcohol to spend money without realizing where I had spent it. :-)</P>
<P>Then I looked at the authors of the book (Kathy Jacobs and Bill Jelen), and I understood.</P>
<P>Bill Jelen (a.k.a. MrExcel of <A href="http://mrexcel.com/">http://mrexcel.com</A>) is one of the co-authors,&nbsp;and he had sent me mail not too long ago asking whether he could use the VBA code I put together for dealing with GUIDs, five years ago. </P>
<P>Of course I said fine -- the code was on my site to use, my only rule about that code&nbsp;has been don't say that you wrote it or anything. Like some people have done in the past with functions that were more interesting than this one (like the stuff I reverse engineered&nbsp;for an article Ken Getz and I wrote on AddressOf in VBA). </P>
<P>People who are polite enough to not only leave the attribution in but to ask first? They don't make many pepple with that much class, these days.</P>
<P>I mentioned in passing that I ought to get a copy of the book. :-)</P>
<P>But I was definitely not expecting top billing in the acknowledgements, or such prominent mention on pp262-3 (though my website was misspelled on the first page, it is correct on the second!).</P>
<P>I'm actually going to read the book this weekend, and maybe start using OneNote a bit more (if <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/Chris_Pratley">Chris Pratley</A> is involved, then&nbsp;I know it has to be worth a look).</P>
<P>Thanks, Bill!</P>

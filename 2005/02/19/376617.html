<P><FONT size=2>What's the easiest way to remove diacritic marks from characters using C#? I would like to have following function:</FONT></P>

<P>Well, there is not really an easy way to do it until Whidbey, but with Whidbey you can use normalization and Unicode character properties (discussed previously in <A id=CategoryEntryList href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/01/31/363701.html" mce_href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/01/31/363701.html">FoldString.NET?

<p><a id="398127" href="#398127">#</a> <strong>Evan Stein</strong> on 17 Mar 2005 12:28 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">First, there are hugely good reasons for stripping diacritics, mainly for the purpose of searching in plain ASCII. This is lossy stuff, but when you're going down to seven bits, that's the idea. The best method is to keep the full string for display and manipulation, and to maintain a search column alongside the original.<br><br>I have a function (actually, a class) that does this in the current C#. It's about 1000 lines, and a bit inconvenient to put in a blog, but if someone can tell me where to post the thing (or sends me a mail), I'd be delighted to share the code.<br><br>Here's how I did it (I’m in verbose mode here -- apologies):<br><br>1) Went to the Unicode database, which is actually a series of text files. Got the code ranges for the Latin set [Scripts.txt]. Got the character values from UnicodeData.txt. There are about 933 characters that qualify as Latin, in all its extensions and modifications.<br><br>2) Field 6 of UnicodeData.txt (starting from 1) has a decomposition map, and can be recursed until no more decomposition is possible. Wrote a routine to do this and write the results to a file. <br><br>3) This took care of the vast majority of values, except some of the IPA characters and the really outlandish ones, such as Anglo-Saxon characters descended from runes. There were about 100 cases where the Unicode Consortium played it safe and didn't suggest any decomposition values, and I don't blame them at all. Armed with the descriptions in UnicodeData.txt (&quot;open, upside-down, backwards, small capital O with a ring, 2 tatoos and a piercing&quot;), as well as a PDF showing what the characters look like, I did my best. I'd like to repeat that some of these are pretty outlandish, in case you skipped when I said that the first 4 times. I'll be shocked if anyone even notices what the choices were.<br><br>4) Originally I held the Unicode database in Oracle, since putting data into program code goes so much against the grain. I also did the recursion at runtime. But, for speed and distribution, you can't beat code, and you also can't beat pre-finished data. I got the finished data into a file, performed step 3, did some word processing ... and dropped it into C#.<br><br>5) Created a class with a static constructor, which loads the data only once. The data is in the form of a Hashtable, so that the Unicode character itself is the key to the fully normalized ASCII character. The speed seems reasonably good.<br><br>6) Wrote the StringStrip( ) function, which copies an input string to an output string character by character in a &quot;for loop&quot;. If it encounters a character it doesn't have (i.e., non-Latin or punctuation), it simply copies that character to the output string without altering it. The one caveat is that some of the characters are diagraphs (e.g., &quot;Dz&quot;), so if you're in a tight spot you'll have to measure the string you get back before using it.<br><br>The ink is still wet, but reading this blog spurred me to get it done. As I said, I'd be delighted to share this, especially if I get some tips back on my ham-handed coding. If you like, you can reach me at Evan@travelogues/DOT/net.<br><br>Regards,<br>Evan</div>

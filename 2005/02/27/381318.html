<h1>How long can I keep up this pace?</h1>

<P>Someone just asked me this question in mail, and he&nbsp;is not the first to ask, either. The whole idea behind the question is an open disbelief that I can maintain the pace of at least one technical post each day that I floated back when I first said <A id=viewpost href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2004/12/13/282387.html">Welcome to <B>Sorting It All Out</B></A>. They assume I will run out of topics eventually.</P>
<P>Of course some people seem to forget that I have <EM>the whole world</EM> <EM>to draw on</EM>. And all the stuff I am not an expert on (which is lots), I usually know someone else who is. So I think I can keep going for quite a spell. I assume that people will get sick of listening to me long before I get sick of saying stuff. :-)</P>
<P>And no, this is not the sort of post I count!</P>

<p><a id="381335" href="#381335">#</a> <strong>Michael Kaplan</strong> on 27 Feb 2005 3:29 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Agreed. Sometimes it is the slowing down that is hard, here!</div>

<p><a id="381608" href="#381608">#</a> <strong>Michael Kaplan</strong> on 28 Feb 2005 7:16 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Sean -- I have no idea what you are talking about here -- I am just on a .TEXT blog, publishing articles. What do you mean &quot;HTML&quot; only?</div>
<p><a id="382062" href="#382062">#</a> <strong>Sean C Sieger</strong> on 28 Feb 2005 6:30 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Michael,<br><br>Thanks for responding. The rss reader that I use displays the rest of the Planet XML blogs as text and your one is displayed with the html markup.<br><br>Sean</div>
<p><a id="382063" href="#382063">#</a> <strong>Michael Kaplan</strong> on 28 Feb 2005 6:32 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Ok, I guess that has to do with the way that it handles shorter posts (<a target="_new" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/">http://blogs.msdn.com/</a> does the same thing for shorter posts).<br><br>Weird. It does not happen usually; I guess I just usually talk a lot. :-)</div>

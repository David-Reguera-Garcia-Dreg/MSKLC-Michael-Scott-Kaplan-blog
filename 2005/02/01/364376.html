<h1>Why that is positively Ethiopic!</h1>

<P>A little over a week ago, when I was mentioning that <A id=ArchiveMonth href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/01/24/359347.html">In Tamil -- sometimes, they are digits; other times, just numbers</A>, Scott Hanselman&nbsp;<a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/01/24/359347.html#360494">suggested</A> "That would ROCK if you would do Ethiopic sometime." Well, rock on Scott -- today is the day.</P>
<P>For the record I am not an expert in these things, just a geek who finds alternate number systems to be really interesting (whether roman numbers, Tamil numbers, or Ethiopic numbers).</P>
<P>Ready? here we go....</P>
<P>Factoid -- there is no Ethiopic zero. There are some numbers that have zeros in them (10, 20, 30, etc.) but no zero. It makes the number system quite fascinating.</P>
<P>We'll start with a small quote from <A title="the Unicode Standard" href="http://www.unicode.org/" target=_blank>the Unicode Standard</A> on the subject, found in Chapter 12, Section 1 (available for viewing online in PDF format, <A href="http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode4.0.0/ch12.pdf">here</A>):</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr>
<P><FONT size=2>Numbers. Ethiopic digit glyphs are derived from the Greek alphabet, possibly borrowed from Coptic letterforms. In modern use, European digits are often used. The Ethiopic number system does not use a zero, nor is it based on digital-positional notation. A number is denoted as a sequence of powers of 100, each preceded by a coefficient (2 through 99). In each term of the series, the power 100^n is indicated by n HUNDRED characters (merged to a digraph when n = 2). The coefficient is indicated by a tens digit and a ones digit, either of which is absent if its value is zero. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>For example, the number 2345 is represented by</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr>

<P dir=ltr>If you are like me then your eyes may have crossed when you read this, even though the example seemed clear enough. Maybe they should have put in a bigger example....</P>
<P dir=ltr>Personally, I find <A href="http://www.abyssiniacybergateway.net/fidel/EthNumbers97.html">Daniel's Ethiopic Number Algorithm #4</A> to be much clearer from a conceptual standpoint. If you prefer something a bit more cerebral with code samples, then you can look at <A href="http://www.geez.org/Numerals/">http://www.geez.org/Numerals/</A> for a slightly different algorithm (using the same number, I suspect a shared source, maybe? &lt;grin&gt;). The page even has links to demonstrations of the algorithm in Perl, C, Java, and C#. </P>
<P dir=ltr>So let us take the resulting number that both sites talk about (፯፻፷፭፼፵፫፻፳፩) and try to convert it back from Ethiopic to our familiar Arabic-Indic digits:</P>
<P dir=ltr>= ፯፻፷፭፼፵፫፻፳፩</P>
<P dir=ltr>= <A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/136f/index.htm">136f</A> <A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/136f/index.htm">137b</A> <A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/1377/index.htm">1377</A> <A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/136d/index.htm">136d</A> <A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/137c/index.htm">137c</A> <A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/1375/index.htm">1375</A> <A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/136b/index.htm">136b</A> <A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/137b/index.htm">137b</A> <A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/1373/index.htm">1373</A> <A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/1369/index.htm">1369</A></P>
<P dir=ltr>= <FONT size=1>DIGIT SEVEN; NUMBER HUNDRED; NUMBER SIXTY; DIGIT FIVE; NUMBER TEN THOUSAND; NUMBER FORTY; DIGIT THREE; NUMBER HUNDRED; NUMBER TWENTY; DIGIT ONE</FONT></P>
<P dir=ltr>(I removed the word ETHIOPIC from each character name to allow more to fit per line)</P>
<P dir=ltr>At this point, even knowing what the number is, the words on the site ("Conversion from Ethiopic numerals into western form is trivial") do not seem quite as true, do they? :-)</P>
<P dir=ltr>Though it actually is easy, it just looks hard. Keeping in mind those "sentinels" that ETHIOPIC NUMBER HUNDRED and ETHIOPIC NUMBER TEN THOUSAND represent (with two digits in each group, between them) and we have:</P>
<P dir=ltr>= <FONT size=1>DIGIT SEVEN; NUMBER HUNDRED; <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NUMBER SIXTY; DIGIT FIVE; NUMBER TEN THOUSAND; <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NUMBER FORTY; DIGIT THREE; NUMBER HUNDRED; <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NUMBER TWENTY; DIGIT ONE</FONT></P>
<P dir=ltr>Notice how the sentinels keep swapping between the TEN THOUSAND and the HUNDRED? Interesting...</P>
<P dir=ltr>Picking at the pieces:</P>
<P dir=ltr>=&nbsp; <FONT size=1>7&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;65&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;43&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 21</FONT></P>
<P dir=ltr>or more conventionally</P>
<P dir=ltr>=&nbsp;<FONT size=1>7654321</FONT></P>
<P dir=ltr>Not too hard, right? Lets try another one:</P>
<P dir=ltr>= ፳፩፼፳፰፻፷፯፼፶፫፻፱</P>
<P dir=ltr>= <A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/1373/index.htm">1373</A> <A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/1369/index.htm">1369</A> <A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/137c/index.htm">137c</A> <A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/1373/index.htm">1373</A> <A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/1370/index.htm">1370</A> <A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/137b/index.htm">137b</A> <A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/1377/index.htm">1377</A> <A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/136f/index.htm">136f</A> <A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/137c/index.htm">137c</A> <A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/1376/index.htm">1376</A> <A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/136b/index.htm">136b</A> <A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/137b/index.htm">137b</A> <A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/1371/index.htm">1371</A></P>
<P dir=ltr><FONT size=1>= NUMBER TWENTY; DIGIT ONE; NUMBER TEN THOUSAND; NUMBER TWENTY; DIGIT EIGHT; NUMBER HUNDRED; NUMBER SIXTY; DIGIT SEVEN; NUMBER TEN THOUSAND; NUMBER FIFTY; DIGIT THREE; NUMBER HUNDRED; DIGIT NINE</FONT></P>
<P dir=ltr>A little harder this time, but lets do the grouping where those grouping sentinels are and see what we have:</P>
<P dir=ltr><FONT size=1>= NUMBER TWENTY; DIGIT ONE; NUMBER TEN THOUSAND; <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NUMBER TWENTY; DIGIT EIGHT; NUMBER HUNDRED; <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NUMBER SIXTY; DIGIT SEVEN; NUMBER TEN THOUSAND; <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NUMBER FIFTY; DIGIT THREE; NUMBER HUNDRED; <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DIGIT NINE</FONT></P>
<P dir=ltr>We seem to be missing a digit right before that nine -- what happened to two numbers in each group? Ah, thats&nbsp;easy -- look at the sentinel!&nbsp;A zero goes there. So we have:</P>
<P dir=ltr><FONT size=1>=&nbsp;21&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;28&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;67&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;53&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT color=#ff0000>0</FONT>9</FONT></P>
<P dir=ltr>And as&nbsp;Tommy Tutone knows, Jenny's New York phone number is indeed 212-867-5309.</P>
<P dir=ltr>Ok, one more that shows a bit more of that missing zero stuff:</P>
<P dir=ltr>= ፶፻፭፼፭</P>
<P dir=ltr>= <A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/1376/index.htm">1376</A> <A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/137b/index.htm">137b</A> <A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/136d/index.htm">136d</A> <A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/137c/index.htm">137c</A> <A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/136d/index.htm">136d</A></P>
<P dir=ltr><FONT size=1>= NUMBER FIFTY; NUMBER HUNDRED; DIGIT FIVE; NUMBER TEN THOUSAND; DIGIT FIVE</FONT></P>
<P dir=ltr>Ooh, a tough one. I'll insert some fake zeros in where they seem to belong based on those sentinels:</P>
<P dir=ltr><FONT size=1>= NUMBER FIFTY; NUMBER HUNDRED;&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT color=#ff0000>DIGIT&nbsp;ZERO; </FONT>DIGIT FIVE; NUMBER TEN THOUSAND;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT color=#ff0000>DIGIT&nbsp;ZERO; DIGIT&nbsp;ZERO;</FONT><FONT color=#000000> </FONT><FONT color=#ff0000>NUMBER HUNDRED;</FONT><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT color=#ff0000>DIGIT&nbsp;ZERO; </FONT>DIGIT FIVE</FONT></P>
<P dir=ltr>So we have:</P>
<P dir=ltr><FONT size=1>=&nbsp;50&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT color=#ff0000>0</FONT><FONT color=#000000>5</FONT><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT color=#ff0000>00</FONT><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT color=#ff0000>0</FONT>5</FONT></P>
<P dir=ltr>Or more conventionally 50,050,005.</P>
<P dir=ltr>Now of course I am not saying that you would write code that is quite this silly. But it is reasonably straightforward to write an algorithm that can handle these numbers. A bit more background required than I would try to give for an interview question (though someone who could understand it in such a short time and come up with a good answer might have impressed me). </P>
<P dir=ltr>Anyone want to take a stab at it? :-)</P>

Those two zeros could just be left blank and you'd have &quot;10. . .45&quot; which is equally unambiguous.<br><br>Anyway, the Ethipians, Romans and Sri Lankins  seemed to get along fine without them.

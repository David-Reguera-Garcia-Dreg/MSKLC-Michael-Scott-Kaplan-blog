<h1>Almost no one on the Unicode List seems to "get" phishing</h1>
<p><em>by Michael S. Kaplan, published on 2005/02/14 09:10 -08:00, original URI: http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/archive/2005/02/14/372356.aspx</em></p>
<hr/> <!-- Archival Source: ProcessPostOld -->
<P>The <A href="http://www.unicode.org/consortium/distlist.html">Unicode List</A>&nbsp;is up to its old fun and games again (well, actually its the participants, not the list itself), and this time it is not about the Unicode BOM.</P>
<P>I talked a little about this problem when I was saying <A id=CategoryEntryList href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/01/11/350482.html">International Domain Names? The sign on the door says 'Gone Phishing'....</A></P>
<P>Then <A href="http://www.watchguard.com/RSS/showarticle.aspx?pack=RSS.IDN">some people</A> started really getting into it because a bunch of hackers "found" a <A href="http://www.shmoo.com/idn/homograph.txt">homograph spoofing issue</A>.&nbsp;They even registered an evil URL (<A href="http://www.xn--pypal-jia7t.com/">www.pаypal.com</A> -- the first "a" is <A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0430/index.htm">U+0430</A>, a CYRILLIC SMALL LETTER A) which in browsers that support the new IDN/punycode stuff becomes <A href="http://www.xn--pypal-4ve.com/">www.xn--pypal-4ve.com</A>.</P>
<P>Then those folks at the Unicode List weighed in (in a thread with 116 posts the last time I looked)....</P>
<P>The "solution" that many people have touted involves a list of common cross-script items that might be expected (like Kana and Kanji). And then to show the actual punycode names, since that way people could tell they were being spoofed.</P>
<P>Anyone else see the flaw here?</P>
<P>The feature is for <STRONG>international domain names</STRONG>. If it were just ASCII then a confusing string would indeed warn users that bad things were going to happen. But if we were all using ASCII <EM>we wouldn't need IDN in the first place, now would we?</EM> </P>
<P>Doesn't it make the whole feature suck just a little bit for its target users if they are left seeing eird crap every time they go to a site that uses their native language for the URL?</P>
<P>I almost weighed into the thread to point out the obvious problems in approach but I did not want to add to the noise (and most likely be drowned out by the people who point out that there is no way to make it secure and how IDN will bring down the internet). So I did not become post #117.</P>
<P>Oops, a few more while I was typing this, mine would have been #120. Sometimes in this post-Kitty Genovese era in which we all live, it is better to not get involved....</P>

Give me the ability to filter out anything that does not originate from a specific country or region and I'll be happy. This includes 3rd party web sites and visitors/traffic to my web site.<br><br>The average person simply does not need to be able to receive email from someone in Russia or Venezuela. By filtering everyting that does not originate in the US, you greatly reduce your attack surface.<br><br>Give me a RELIABLE way to do this and the whole IDN thing becomes a non-issue.</div>

But how about the rest of the world?<br><br>&quot;We are not alone anymore&quot; (and I do not mean that in an X-Files sense!)</div>

<p><a id="372407" href="#372407">#</a> <strong>Frank Richter</strong> on Monday, February 14, 2005 9:55 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Hm, AFAIK the entered IDN is normalized before converted to Punycode (e.g. &#223; becomes ss)... couldn't mappings be added that map identically looking characters to the same code point (e.g. the small cyrillic a would get mapped to the plain old ASCII small a), for anti-phishing purposes?</div>
<p><a id="372409" href="#372409">#</a> <strong>CN</strong> on Monday, February 14, 2005 9:57 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">I think we have two problems here:<br><br>a) &quot;Cross-scripting&quot;, when individual letters/symbols are replaced by their homographs in another script to fit in. The current paypal address is an example of that.<br><br>b) When the complete domain name is represented in another script, while maintaining homography.<br><br>Something like the cross item list you mention could solve a -- limit which character groups may appear in one domain. www.&lt;strangestuff&gt;.com should be allowed, while www.pa&lt;strangestuff&gt;pal.com should not.<br><br>This would alleviate the problem a little. It does certainly not solve it, because of b and also because of<br>c) &#237;&#236;&#239;&#238;ı, or for example &#226; in languages where you're used to seeing &#229; (and have a shitty non-ClearType, low resolution, small size display and simply don't look closely)<br><br>I don't see any easy ways out of this. One could speculate about a highligthing in the browser, in addition to the site security, of whether the site is in the browsing history. Hopefully, you're more careful if you log in for the first time and create your account or are setting up a new machine, while a phishing attack trying to get you to key in your account info would give a somehow distinctly different &quot;experience&quot; to the user.<br><br>After all, highlighting of that a site that has already been visited has been around for ages for LINKS to said sites, adding it prominently in the browser UI could improve things.<br><br>Just some stray thoughts, I know this is far from both the Unicode list and your field of direct interest.</div>

That would create inconvenience for anybody trying to register an IDN, and also open up new possibilities for squatting (what if I register my IDN first, before you get the chance to register all-Latin domain name?)</div>
<p><a id="372444" href="#372444">#</a> <strong>Igor Tandetnik</strong> on Monday, February 14, 2005 10:45 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">For a concrete example of point b, &quot;paypal&quot; can more or less convincingly be represented as &quot;раура1&quot; - that's five Cyrillic letters and a digit 'one'. With some fonts, you'll have a hard time telling the difference.<br><br>Here is the list of Cyrillic letters that look similar to some Latin ones - have fun finding sites that could be spoofed:<br>а е з к о р с у х<br>In addition to these (that look similar in both upper- and lowercase), a few letters only look right when capitalized:<br>В М Н Т Ь<br>Well, the last one is a bit of a stretch.</div>

Going from one extreme to the other.<br><br>Unless this is a temporary thing until they enable functionaliy to do IDN right. Otherwise Firefox is just saying that if you want IDN you will be screwed over by phishing.<br><br>So Firefox either gets one thumb up for admitting they were overeager and working to slow down and do it right (to get two thumbs up you have to do all that the ferst time!) or two thumbs down if they are just panicking and turning off the functionality....</div>

It's what the encoded words look like that makes this technique useful. <br><br>I propose that there's only one way to fix this problem and that's to have some form of verifiability of these domain names. Maybe finally we have to accept that domain names for commercial organisations have to go through a vetting process (digital certificates) while all other domains (for personal use??) remain on the old system.<br><br>Your browser would then be able to tell you that www.paypal.com is a genuine commercial domain name, but www.pAypal.com has not been verified. I know that www.netcraft.com have a browser plug in for IE that does something like this.<br><br>I've some more ideas on phishing emails on my blog...which follow a similar line.<br><br>Best regards<br>Steve.</div>
<p><a id="373009" href="#373009">#</a> <strong>Jonathan Payne</strong> on Tuesday, February 15, 2005 7:22 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">I was wondering if this could be fixed by simply not allowing similar looking domain names to be registered.  That way, if you registered paypal.com, your registration would &quot;lock-out&quot; all similar looking variants.  The domain registrar could maintain a list of potentially similar characters which could be updated as problems arise.  Combined with some kind of complaints procedure for catching the domains that fall through the net, I would expect this to solve most issues.</div>

<P>Today, I am going to talk about language groups. They are a little confusing....</P>
<P>First we will take their names, straight from our master NLS header file, winnls.h (taken from the one that ships with VS.NET 2003):</P>
<P><FONT face="Courier New">//<BR>//&nbsp; Language Group ID Values.<BR>//<BR>#define LGRPID_WESTERN_EUROPE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x0001&nbsp;&nbsp; // Western Europe &amp; U.S.<BR>#define LGRPID_CENTRAL_EUROPE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x0002&nbsp;&nbsp; // Central Europe<BR>#define LGRPID_BALTIC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x0003&nbsp;&nbsp; // Baltic<BR>#define LGRPID_GREEK&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x0004&nbsp;&nbsp; // Greek<BR>#define LGRPID_CYRILLIC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x0005&nbsp;&nbsp; // Cyrillic<BR>#define LGRPID_TURKISH&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x0006&nbsp;&nbsp; // Turkish<BR>#define LGRPID_JAPANESE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x0007&nbsp;&nbsp; // Japanese<BR>#define LGRPID_KOREAN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x0008&nbsp;&nbsp; // Korean<BR>#define LGRPID_TRADITIONAL_CHINESE&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x0009&nbsp;&nbsp; // Traditional Chinese<BR>#define LGRPID_SIMPLIFIED_CHINESE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x000a&nbsp;&nbsp; // Simplified Chinese<BR>#define LGRPID_THAI&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x000b&nbsp;&nbsp; // Thai<BR>#define LGRPID_HEBREW&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x000c&nbsp;&nbsp; // Hebrew<BR>#define LGRPID_ARABIC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x000d&nbsp;&nbsp; // Arabic<BR>#define LGRPID_VIETNAMESE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x000e&nbsp;&nbsp; // Vietnamese<BR>#define LGRPID_INDIC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x000f&nbsp;&nbsp; // Indic<BR>#define LGRPID_GEORGIAN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x0010&nbsp;&nbsp; // Georgian<BR>#define LGRPID_ARMENIAN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x0011&nbsp;&nbsp; // Armenian</FONT></P>
<P>This list will help you start feeling the confusion. They seem to be based on language. No thats not right, it must be script. No, maybe based on region. No? Perhaps something else entirely. </P>
<P>Heck, the English - New Zealand&nbsp;locale shows up under the "Western European" language group. Riddle me <STRONG>that</STRONG> one, won't you?</P>
<P>In Windows 2000 language groups matched the big list of "languages your system supports" in <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2004/12/11/279997.html">Regional Options</A> and that is when language groups were analagous to&nbsp;a feature in the operting system.</P>
<P>Ok, maybe <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/intl/nls_0ddl.asp">NLS Terminology</A> will set us straight on what they are supposed to be:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT size=2><STRONG>Purpose</STRONG>: Provides all keyboard layouts, IMEs, TrueType fonts, font links, LPKs, bitmap fonts and code page translation tables needed by the system for a group of languages. Therefore impacts all other settings in this list.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><STRONG>Expository text: </STRONG>The <I>language group</I> controls which system locale, user locales, input locales, and user interface (UI) languages can be selected. For example, Windows installs the Western Europe and United States language group by default. This default cannot be removed. For each localized version, the specified language group is the default and cannot be removed. Thus, if the English version of Windows is installed in a non-English speaking country/region, the user will typically install another language group. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>When adding a language group, Windows copies (but does not activate) the necessary keyboard files, Input Method Editors (IMEs), TrueType Font files, bitmap font files, and National Language Support (.nls) files. Adding a language group also adds registry values for font linking and installs scripting engines for complex script languages (Arabic, Hebrew, Indic, and Thai).</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Giving (for example) Armenian its own language group did not really serve as much purpose here since the font was pretty small, there is no IME, and no special system support is required like with other language groups. So they do not feel like a big group of equal partners....</P>
<P>Then, starting in Windows XP and Server 2003 the notion has largely been replaced by two checkboxes in the second tab of <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2004/12/11/279998.html">Regional and Language Options</A> -- essentially giving us just three groups:</P>
<OL>
<LI>East Asian languages (basically ideographic scripts e.g. Chinese) 
<LI>Complex script languages (e.g. Thai, Hebrews, Indic, Arabic script) 
<LI>Everyone else the system supports</LI></OL>
<P>The idea was that Windows would support everybody unless it required a ton of IME/font support files (category 1) or turning on complex script support throughout the OS (category 2). </P>
<P>And in XP and Server 2003, even trying to install language group support a-la-<A href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;289125">Q289125</A>&nbsp;will go in and decide which of the above categories the request was in, and install that entire category's underlying technological support. So now language groups (which were never too clearly defined anyway) are at the level of an appendix or a vestigial tail!</P>
<P>What happens with them going forward? Who can say? In a world where parts of Australia are classified as being Western European, anything is possible! :-)</P>

<p><a id="374760" href="#374760">#</a> <strong>Mike Williams</strong> on 16 Feb 2005 1:36 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">It's only because Americans confuse Australia and Austria all the time. The first week I was at Microsoft Sydney I intercepted a call from Roger Heinen's PA, who wanted to ensure an English-speaking person would be present for his conference call the next day. A couple of years later, one of our product managers got a call from a marketing manager in Office who said she was going to Photokina in Germany and that she should drop in on Sydney &quot;while she was in the area&quot;.<br><br>Oh, and yes almost mail from Redmond to me was sent care of their European dispatch office, and almost always said MS AUSTRIA.<br><br></div>

I was not lumping them together, I was giving another example of a non-Western European locale (English - Australia) ! :-)<br><br>Mike -- Also a good one, but not the reason in this case. Its mainly because the lines are mostly drawn by code page, so being in cp1252 makes you an eligible member of the club....</div>

I really don't think Microsoft is aware how often it bruises other cultures, and even when it is made aware - it doesn't do anything about it, unless there is an immediate threat to business.</div>
<p><a id="374833" href="#374833">#</a> <strong>Michael Kaplan</strong> on 16 Feb 2005 3:01 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">I understand the generic argument, but I can promise you this is the one group that knows more about the world than just about anything else (including long. and lat. if you take GEO stuff into account!).<br><br>It probably would have been better to not have a feature that is so functionally schizophrenic as language groups. One version later and they are no longer needed but now we are stuck with them forever. :-(</div>

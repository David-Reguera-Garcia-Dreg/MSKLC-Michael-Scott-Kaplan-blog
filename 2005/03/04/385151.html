<P>There he is.... it is <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/peterty/">peterty's WebLog</A>. His first post is about <A id=viewpost href="http://blogs.msdn.com/peterty/archive/2005/03/04/385063.aspx">Localization - Chinese Languages</A>.</P>
<P>Interesting bit of trivia -- the feature he talks about, the Microsoft.VisualBasic's StrConv function's addition of mapping between Simplified and Traditional Cheese, is my fault!</P>
<P>This is not to say I wrote it, because I didn't. But back before Visual Studio.NET's 1.0 had shipped, I had noticed that the StrConv function was mostly just a wrapper around the <A title=LCMapString href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/intl/nls_5s2v.asp" target=_blank>LCMapString</A> API. There were just a few important differences:</P>
<UL>
<LI>It also includes a <A title=WideCharToMultiByte href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/intl/unicode_2bj9.asp" target=_blank>WideCharToMultiByte</A> and <A title=MultiByteToWideChar href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/intl/unicode_17si.asp" target=_blank>MultiByteToWideChar</A> wrapper, in its vbFromUnicode/vbUnicode parameters. This particular addition made Julie Bennett cringe&nbsp;(she mentioned to me once that she already thinks of the over-overloaded functionality in LCMapString as a huge hack!). 
<LI>There was no linguistic casing flag added, to match LCMAP_LINGUISTIC_CASING (I describe what that flag does when I asked <A id=CategoryEntryList href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2004/12/11/279942.html">What does "linguistic casing" mean?</A> 
<LI>There are those LCMAP_SIMPLIFIED_CHINESE and LCMAP_TRADITIONAL_CHINESE mapping flags.</LI></UL>
<P>Anyway, I complained about the lack of the simplified/traditional mapping in the function, and put in a bug report against the issue. And after it seemed like they were not interested I promptly forgot about it, since this was many years ago. </P>
<P>But recently somebody told me that it was added in part because of that bug, which is pretty cool. :-)</P>
<P>Note that this functionality does not currently exist in the <A title=System.Globalization href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfsystemglobalization.asp" target=_blank>System.Globalization</A> namespace. Even in Whidbey. I'll have to ask someone why....</P>
<P>In any case, welcome, Peter!</P>

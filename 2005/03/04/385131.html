<P>I suppose I should get a life, but stuff like this seems kind of cool. :-)</P>
<P>On your left will be the button that looks like this:</P>
<P><A href="http://www.csthota.com/blogmap/neighblogs.aspx?feed=http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/rss.aspx" target=_blank><IMG src="http://www.csthota.com/blogmap/neighblogmap.gif" border=0></A></P>
<P>I guess I could have put the full map:</P>
<P><A href="http://www.csthota.com/blogmap"><IMG alt=http src="http://www.csthota.com/blogmap/blogapi.ashx?method=blogmap&amp;feed=http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/rss.aspx&amp;height=250&amp;width=150&amp;label=Michael%20Kaplan"></A></P>
<P>but that seemed like overkill, and a lot of real estate. If I were ever going take up that much space it would not be the map (I am not enough of a star that a "Map to the Star" kind of thing really qualifies).</P>
<P>To take up that kind of room I'd probably want to put up one of my MRIs or something. Anyone want to learn how to become a good armchair neuoradiologist? </P>
<P>(The sad thing about <EM>that</EM> is that it does not take much expertise to be able to write accurate information that is more detailed than the average neuroradiologist writes for such an MRI.)</P>
<P>There is even some precedent. <A id=CategoryDisplay1_Categories_CatList__ctl3_LinkList__ctl7_Link href="http://blogs.msdn.com/EricLippert" target=_blank>Eric Lippert</A>&nbsp;puts an image of&nbsp;a scan on his site. Per the site news, the blog (Fabulous Adventures in Coding) is a glimpse into what's on the mind of a typical Microsoft developer. So why not have yet another, more graphical,&nbsp;view of what is on his mind? :-)</P>
<P>I wonder what else might be fun to put up there. I thought about a <A href="http://www.clocklink.com/ENG/gallery.htm#">clock</A>, but if you are on a computer then you already have one of those in plain sight. Knowing what time it is here just doubles the chance that people might call at a strange hour!</P>
<P>I think the map link is silly enough. That and my random text on the left should be enough to keep me smiling....</P>
<P>By the way, I am just blathering now to make sure that I have enough text that this post does not get put into the summary feed as HTML, which <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/02/27/381318.html#381512">some people</A> don't care for very much. :-)</P>
<P>What else is going on around here? Hmmm.</P>
<P>Oh yeah. I have another team member who has joined the blogsophere (<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/shawnste/" target=new>Shawn Steele</A>) and he is posting more about <A id=viewpost href="http://blogs.msdn.com/shawnste/archive/2005/03/03/384692.aspx">IDN &amp; Homographs</A> than I would want to, which takes a very different kind of bravery (like the kind that /. might take an interest in one day!). :-)&nbsp; </P>
<P>Ok, I think that should be enough text now. Too bad I am not paid by the word, given how much I go on about stuff....</P>

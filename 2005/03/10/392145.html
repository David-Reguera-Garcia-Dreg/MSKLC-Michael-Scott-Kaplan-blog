<P>Yes, it's yet another speaking gig....</P>
<P>In addition to <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/03/05/386026.html">TechÂ·Ed 2005</A>, I will&nbsp;also be speaking at the <A href="http://www.gcpcug.org/sigdetail.php?pick_sig=27">Microsoft SQL Server Special Interest Group</A>&nbsp;of the <A href="http://www.gcpcug.org/index.php">Greater Cleveland PC Users Group</A>.</P>
<P>This will be on Thursday, April 21st, in Solon, Ohio for anyone in the area who wanted to pop by and hear&nbsp;a bit about SQL Server's international features. From their humble origins in SQLS 7.0 to their cool coming of age in SQLS 2000 to their upcoming maturity in SQLS 2005 (a.k.a. Yukon). It should be a lot of fun, and it is an interesting talk about a very cool set of technologies....</P>
<P>Why this meeting in particular? Well, I will be visiting family right around then, and my new niece is actually living not too far from where I'll be talking (though I assume she won't be coming to the presentation!). </P>
<P>It is actually an old tradition of mine to speak at a local SIG or UG or DG when I am travelling anytime the dates line up (it is why I ended up speaking with Cathy Wissink at <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/02/10/370460.html">IMUG</A> a few months back). I think it is just nice to hang out with people who have a geekiness that is on the same order of magnitude as my own. You know, to talk with them for a bit, and present some things. :-)</P>
<P>So if you are going to be in the area around then, feel free to pop by (directions and other details about the location can be found at the SIG link, above).</P>
<P>I'll remind people when it is a bit closer to the day. Hope to see you there!</P>

<P>Back in December I posted the article that I submitted (too late) for the <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/Office/previous/access/10years/heroes.asp">Access Heroes</A> pages put up when the <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/previous/access/10years/default.asp">10th anniversary of Access</A> was being celebrated. In the flotsam and jetsam stream of consciousness at the end, one of the points I listed there was:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr>
<P><SPAN><FONT face=Verdana size=2>that Andrew Miller works with 96% efficiency (conservative estimate from team members) and at times I really wanted to modify that estimate -- <EM>upward</EM>.</FONT></SPAN></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Well, tonight I was reminded of why I keep the <A id=CategoryDisplay1_Categories_CatList__ctl2_LinkList__ctl12_Link href="http://blogs.msdn.com/" target=_blank>MSDN Blogs</A> and <A id=CategoryDisplay1_Categories_CatList__ctl2_LinkList__ctl18_Link href="http://blogs.technet.com/" target=_blank>TechNet Blogs</A> on the list of the <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2004/12/18/325156.html">Blogs I read</A>.</P>
<P>Andrew Miller has a blog, with a subtitle of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/andrewrmiller/">Thoughts on Access</A>.</P>
<P>As one of the original wizard developers before I even knew there was such a job as&nbsp;a wizard developer for Microsoft Access (let alone before I had the job myself), he was responsible for some of the most maintainable code in a code base estimated at over 80,000 lines of VBA that was in many senses utterly unmaintainable.</P>
<P>I was not the person who initially made the claim about him, but I had no problem agreeing with it. </P>
<P>His blog is definitely on my list....</P>

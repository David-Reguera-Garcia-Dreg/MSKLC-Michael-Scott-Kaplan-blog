<P>Looks like they are starting to gear up for Tech·Ed 2005 (starting June 5-10)!</P>
<P>You can see session info <A href="http://www.msteched.com/content/sessions.aspx">here</A>.</P>
<P>My&nbsp;sessions (slightly modified abstracts from before, mainly to get rid of that odd use of the word "exploit" and a few other weirdnesses):</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr>
<DIV class=catalogDiv_normal id=catalogDiv_ffa33520>
<DIV class=sessionTitle><STRONG>DAT290&nbsp;&nbsp;</STRONG>Databases for the World: Designing Multilingual Databases Using SQL Server 2005 </DIV>Wednesday, June 8 10:15 AM - 11:30 AM</div>-->
<DIV class=sessionAbstract><STRONG>Speaker(s)</STRONG>: <SPAN>Michael Kaplan</SPAN></DIV>
<DIV class=sessionAbstract><STRONG>Session Type(s)</STRONG>: Breakout</DIV>
<DIV class=sessionAbstract><STRONG>Track(s)</STRONG>: Database Development</DIV>
<DIV class=sessionAbstract>SQL Server 2005 introduces new and enhanced international features that are very important to customers in many parts of the world -- from proper Indic support to recognition of the supplementary characters used in East Asia, as well as many more important international scenarios. This session highlights the new features, and provides both code samples and advice on best practices to make good use of them.</DIV>
<DIV class=sessionAbstract>&nbsp;</DIV></DIV>
<DIV class=catalogDiv_normal id=catalogDiv_49cdf8ea>
<DIV class=sessionTitle><STRONG>DBA319&nbsp;&nbsp;</STRONG>Databases for the World: Best Practices for Search in Multilingual Data Sets Using SQL Server Collation for Sorting and Indexing</DIV>Thursday, June 9 10:15 AM - 11:30 AM</div>-->
<DIV class=sessionAbstract><STRONG>Speaker(s)</STRONG>: <SPAN>Michael Kaplan</SPAN></DIV>
<DIV class=sessionAbstract><STRONG>Session Type(s)</STRONG>: Breakout</DIV>
<DIV class=sessionAbstract><STRONG>Track(s)</STRONG>: Database Administration</DIV>
<DIV class=sessionAbstract>SQL collation (sorting/indexing) in multilingual databases is often poorly understood. This session is an opportunity to learn the ins and outs of multilingual data set searching and best practices for searching multilingual data sets. </DIV></DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>No schedule yet, but that will make its way there eventually. </P>
<P>Also, for what its worth, DBA319 will be both a development <EM>and</EM> an administration topic.</P>
<P>To answer the questions of others, there is interest in some of the international Tech·Ed events for these topics, but no word on who will definitely want them yet. Folks who want to see these talks or any of the others in the <A href="http://www.msteched.com/content/tracks.aspx#cd70747a-9c26-428f-811c-dd015ecb25c0">Global Development and Deployment</A> virtual track might want to look into whatever voting or other selection techniques are available at the <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/events/teched2005/worldwide.mspx">International Tech·Ed</A> they fancy.</P>
<P>(thanks for the pointer by <A href="http://www.gregcons.com/kateblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=2762e183-ba2f-49ea-99ed-38dfb7f71e89">Kate Gregory</A>)</P>

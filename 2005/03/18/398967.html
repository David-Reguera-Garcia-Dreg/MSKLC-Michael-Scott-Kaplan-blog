<P>Yes, the picture in the upper left hand corner is unlikely to change. Here it is full-size:</P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/michka.jpg"></P>
<P>You will notice it is not too much better. But I not terribly photogenic.</P>
<P>Tamra Myers took this picture of me one day testing a camera I think I had just bought when I had an office somewhere in building 1 (this was over seven years and 17 offices ago!). </P>
<P>I really like the picture as it looked just like me. I think it still does, mostly. Though I have different glasses now; roughly a hundred years after big lenses went out of style, I got smaller lenses. With the same tortoise shell color. Change is not something I do a whole lot of....</P>
<P>The pic is not out of focus -- I just look that way (like Rosie O'Donnell's boyfriend in <A href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0104694/">A League of Their Own</A>). :-)</P>
<P>The sweatshirt I was wearing then is actually&nbsp;in the hands of someone named Jennifer who thought it looked <EM>really</EM> comfortable when I was visiting a friend of hers in New Jersey not too long after the picture was taken. It says "Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition"&nbsp;and she just kind of guilted me into sending it to her. I kind of missed it after I sent it to her so I begged the admin for another one. </P>
<P>It was the only real reward (beyond getting paid, of course!) for developing the Setup Wizard&nbsp;for Access 97.&nbsp; To date that is the only Microsoft project for which I worked 36 consecutive hours in a day, and Bob willing it is the only one I ever will. I do not have a comfy chair in my office anymore so it is not much of a temptation to sleep over, anyway. No matter how tired I am.</P>
<P>Anyway, I have a soft spot for the picture. Even though it looks odd clipped up there in the corner and not too much better full size down here, it is still probably the best I can do for a picture.</P>
<P>To those who don't like it (you know who you are!)&nbsp;will just have to&nbsp;suffer, until/unless you manage to take a picture that I think looks better. Which is pretty unlikely...</P>

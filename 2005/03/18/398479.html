<P>Antti Nivala asked in the microsoft.public.platformsdk.mslayerforunicode newsgroup:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr>
<P><FONT size=2>Our software uses <A title=MSLU href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/handson/dev/mslu_announce.mspx" target=_blank>MSLU</A>. I noticed that if I run our programs with Application Verifier 2.50 with the Handles test enabled, I get a bunch of Invalid Handle exceptions during module loading. In the end, these prevent the program from running. The call stack points to MSLU. If I rebuild the program without MSLU, the Invalid Handle exceptions no longer appear.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Is this a known issue? Is it OK, or is MSLU (or I) doing something that is not perfectly OK?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Note that I am not saying that MSLU would have caused any real problems in the normal use of our program. I just want to confirm why the Handles test of Application Verifier 2.50 fails if MSLU is used.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Here's some relevant output from WinDbg:</FONT></P>

<P>This is a bug I was pretty sure I was familiar with, so I asked "What version of the .LIB are you using?". Antti replied:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr>
<P><FONT size=2>I think it was from Platform SDK July 2002 edition. Anyway, I upgraded to using the LIB version that ships with Platform SDK February 2003 and the problem disappeared.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Thanks :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Antti</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Yep, that was the problem. It has to do with the MSLU loader (contained in unicows.lib) which does the following:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Takes its&nbsp;bunch of data segments, one per API that might be called, with all of the necessary info for the API (the name, the name of the "stub" function to call if the API cannot be found, a pointer to our ResolveThunk() function,&nbsp;etc.). 
<LI>The first time an API is called, ResolveThunk() is called with all the API information in #1. 
<LI>ResolveThunk() figures out what API should be called. It fixes up that pointer to itself,&nbsp;changing it to the actual API. 
<LI>Call FlushInstructionCache() to flush out any cached information for the modified code in the change to #3 
<LI>All future calls to the API go directly to it, making ResolveThunk() a "call once per API" function.</LI></OL>
<P>The problem with this bug is that it turns out step #4 was not needed, so the call was pretty much ignored on all platforms.&nbsp;Unfortunately,&nbsp;the handle being used in the call was not valid for the call to FlushInstructionCache() and <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnappcom/html/appverifier.asp">AppVerifier</A> is an application that works hard to find such problems.</P>
<P>The fix was simple enough -- just remove the call to FlushInstructionCache. It was doing nothing other than breaking AppVerifier anyway.</P>
<P>The bug was&nbsp;customer-reported (customers use our tools, even if we do not always do it&nbsp; :-) ), and I had the fix in the next Platform SDK....</P>
<P>The moral of the story? Update your Platform SDK from time to time -- it may fix impotant bugs! :-)</P>

The SDK is huge, even though you might only wish to get the documentation for a single api, such as the IE api, or only a single library like <a title="MSLU" href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/handson/dev/mslu_announce.mspx" target="_blank">MSLU</a>. You still have to download the core SDK 150 mb plus I think. And then go through a temperomental installation process. I don't need all that SDK. I might need a single library. The web page from where you get the SDK has bugs. On XP SP2 it throws up an error dialog box. Plus, the SDK only works and is tested with only Visual Studio. What about other compilers, Borland? Why doesn't it include a free C++ compiler. MS offers its compiler for free. Why don't you include it with the SDK? Or at least include some essential Windows headers with the free C++ compiler. Also, where is some help for beginners. Where?<br>The whole SDK thing is a mess. Surely there should be a better way. How do other companies do it? How does Apple do it? I think that they provide an online list of downloadable PDFs containing the documentation. Why not Microsoft? Why should I have to browse or buy a huge MSDN Library? Whenever I bring up this topic people say that the SDK process is ok. But I think not. There should be a much better way. Why do many students have downloaded eg. the Java SDK whilst nobody knows about the Platform SDK?</div>
<p><a id="398595" href="#398595">#</a> <strong>Michael Kaplan</strong> on 18 Mar 2005 8:01 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">There is an International MVP with the handle of Ted who spends time in the microsoft.public.platformsdk.mslayerforunicode newsgroup. Every time a Platform SDK update comes out on MSDN Universal he gives exact info on how to get the one file that has unicows.lib in it and get out that one .LIB file....<br><br>And the methods he use are hardly the only ways to get targeted updates (not all methods include needing MSDN Universal!). To my knowledge I have never intentionally and only once unintentionally broken backward compatibility (it wa not me; they changed the build environment on me!). Regular downloads of this .LIB file make all of the difference in the world. All one needs is a little creativity!</div>
<p><a id="399498" href="#399498">#</a> <strong>Dean Harding</strong> on 20 Mar 2005 7:18 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">There was a post a while back (<a target="_new" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/loripe/archive/2005/03/01/382684.aspx">http://blogs.msdn.com/loripe/archive/2005/03/01/382684.aspx</a>) on how MS distributes SDKs, and I assume there'll be some progress in the Whidbey timeframe.  So it's not a complete loss :)</div>

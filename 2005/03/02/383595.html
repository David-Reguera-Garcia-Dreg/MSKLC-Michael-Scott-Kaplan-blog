<h1>Not running as Admin....</h1>

<P>Each day, for security reasons, more and more people are making sure that we are not running as an administrator on their computers. And even though for most purposes this process has little pain, it is those small pain points that make people hesitant to make the jump. Luckily, there are places like <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/aaron_margosis/">Aaron Margosis' WebLog</A>&nbsp;(The Non-Admin blog - running with least privilege on the desktop). There are a lot of interesting posts about how to work in the world where one voluntarily chooses to not be all-powerful....</P>
<P>Aaron has two specific posts that caught my eye:</P>
<P><A id=viewpost href="http://blogs.msdn.com/aaron_margosis/archive/2005/02/09/370264.aspx">Remembering Calculator and Character Map Settings</A> </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT size=2>Here’s an odd little one you might not have noticed.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The Windows Calculator applet remembers whether it was last displayed in “Standard” or “Scientific” view, and whether digit grouping was selected, and restores those settings the next time you use it.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Because this applet dates back to the very early days of Windows, it saves these settings in the win.ini file in the Windows folder.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>There are two problems with this:<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>1) the settings apply to all users of the computer, and 2) you need to be an administrator to write your settings into this file.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Likewise, the Character Map applet remembers the last font and codepage selected, and whether “Advanced view” was checked – but only if the user is an admin.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P dir=ltr><A id=viewpost href="http://blogs.msdn.com/aaron_margosis/archive/2005/02/11/371474.aspx">Changing the system date, time and/or time zone</A> </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P dir=ltr><FONT size=2>By default, only Administrators and Power Users can use the “Date and Time” applet to change the computer’s date, time, or time zone.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>A regular User double-clicking on the clock in the notification area of the taskbar gets only an error message that says, “You do not have the proper privilege level to change the System Time.”<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>This is probably the #1 annoyance for people who have tried running as non-admin.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P dir=ltr>These articles&nbsp;both deal with particular pain points that have hurt me in the past, so seeing the ways to work around the issues is great. </P>
<P dir=ltr>Rock on, Aaron! You are definitely on the list of the <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2004/12/18/325156.html">blogs I read</A>....</P>

<p><a id="383618" href="#383618">#</a> <strong>Michael Kaplan</strong> on 2 Mar 2005 8:30 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Well, they did have other fish to fry with Calc.EXE, but it I admit it might have been nice to fix up the admin stuff while they were in there. :-)<br><br>That thing with the datetime usage is totally true. Given how the calendar works in there it is actually a little embarrassing, all things being equal....</div>
<p><a id="383625" href="#383625">#</a> <strong>Brian</strong> on 2 Mar 2005 8:39 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">The only thing I ever use the time applet for is looking at the calendar.  Is there another place to find a calendar in Win XP?</div>
<p><a id="383628" href="#383628">#</a> <strong>Michael Kaplan</strong> on 2 Mar 2005 8:41 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Not built in, no. Which is kind of the problem....<br><br>But this works around the non-admin blocker for that usage nicely. :-)</div>
<p><a id="383682" href="#383682">#</a> <strong>Peter Ibbotson</strong> on 2 Mar 2005 9:35 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">More irritating still there was a nice calendar application in Win3.11 which got dropped and subsumed into the clock applet.<br>Like most folks I just use it as a calendar nothing else.<br>Does anyone do a good replacement that isn't full of adware?</div>
<p><a id="383712" href="#383712">#</a> <strong>Michael Kaplan</strong> on 2 Mar 2005 10:05 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Probably easier to write one than to find one, in the end. :-)</div>

Daniel Smith</strong> on 2 Mar 2005 10:16 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">I think running w/o Administrator rights would instantly solve a significant percentage of the various &quot;security&quot; problems.<br><br>It bothers me that such an option is hardly mentioned in all the talk about spyware, malware, virus detection, firewalls, etc.<br><br>Of course, Microsoft itself isn't helping any here; rather than investing in new spyware detection software, they should be working hard to ensure that using Administrator rights is rather infrequent: <a target="_new" href="http://spaces.msn.com/members/jdanielsmith/Blog/cns">http://spaces.msn.com/members/jdanielsmith/Blog/cns</a>!1pRjebUoVh0bNLSJvrecmAEg!164.entry<br><br><br></div>

But after months and months of talk, &quot;show me the money!&quot;<br><br>I hope that back-porting of Avalon &amp; Indigo to XP is the new way of doing things at Microsoft: delivering new stuff in smaller chunks as it is ready rather than a single large release as is being done for Whidbey.  You can still have a periodic Visual Studio 2005 release that puts everything together.</div>

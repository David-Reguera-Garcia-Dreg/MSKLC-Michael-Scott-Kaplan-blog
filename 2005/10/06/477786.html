<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I had to put down my cat Chelsea last night.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Those of you who read this blog may have been <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/03/14/395177.html">following</A> <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/04/09/406841.html">her</A> <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/06/24/432114.html">story</A>. But, in the true spirit of Seattle weather predictions, her passing that was judged to be little more than 30 days from the diagnosis actually was delayed for nearly seven months.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Which is okay, since she never took direction very well from anyone.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>At first over those months, she was actually gaining weight (all of that Fancy Feast, no doubt!), at one point making it up to what was probably a lifetime high of 10 pounds. But then even as she ate a lot, she started losing weight. And by the end she would still walk up to get the food but would not even be able to finish those small cans. Her weight eventually made it as far down as 4 pounds.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>When I got home, she had one pupil dilated and one fully contracted, but neither reacted to light. Her temperature was down&nbsp;and although you could see she was breathing she had some reflex actions that indicated she as struggling for oxygen -- because blood was probably just not circulating well, at all.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I took her to the vet right away (they were open until 9pm), but it really was too late. At some point on her last day she must have thrown several clots and had a stroke, with multiple areas affected. If it were&nbsp;not Chelsea, I probably would have been fascinated about the medical aspects of it. As it was, I had a bit too much on my mind. After all, it was time to say goodbye.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But as Dr. Cottrille (Dr. Emery had gone for the day) looked for a vein it was clear that her blood pressure was so slow than injection would probably be ineffectual. The only way to euthanize would be to inject it directly into the liver.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Bracing me for the worst, she warned me that it could take up to 20 minutes for it to act. But seconds later both pupils were fully dilated, and she was gone.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So my plea to the cat-goddess Bubastis? Well, it would be that my dearest Chelsea Antoinette can find happiness now. Bog knows that the delightful spirit of a cat who did no wrong deserves that much....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>(for Chelsea)</FONT></P>

My wife ended up cooking him a pot roast as that was all he would eat. While I was at the Summit she had to take him to the vet for his final visit. I found out about it on Sunday when we finally caught up. I had expected it but it was still very hard to hear.<br><br>Take care,<br>Joe<br></div>

But that's not the reason not to have feelings towards others. The time spent together, no matter how short, is well worth the pain at the end.</div>

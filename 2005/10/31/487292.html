<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Yes, that's right. I am at zero bugs for the milestone and heading to Adobe in San Jose for the Unicode Technical Committee meeting, a quarterly gathering that goes through changes, additions, updates, and technical reports for the Unicode Standard.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I'll still be posting while I am out, though I cannot promise that I will be approving anonymous comments as often. So be patient if you are posting comments anonymously.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>If you see anything odd in the 'Way Back Machine' like a post count that is bigger that the number of posts, it is just some of posting ahead to make sure I can stay as consistent as I usually am....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And if you are going to the UTC also then I will see you soon!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>In a comment to my post a few days ago, Nick Lamb <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/10/12/479561.html#481023">suggested</A>:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><EM><FONT size=2>Is it true then that U+005c looks different (as in, it looks like ¥) on Japanese Windows systems? </FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT size=2>If so, isn't it key to GIFT's mission to deliver replacement fonts that fix this issue (shouldn't be hard, it's just one substitute glyph across maybe a dozen key fonts) ? </FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I answered Nick's specific question <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/10/12/479561.html#481049">here</A>:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><EM><FONT size=2>If it was considered a bug to fix, that would be true. But it is an intentional design decision, so there is nothing to fix. </FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT size=2>You do not need a Japanese copy of Windows to see it. If you change your default system locale ("language for non-Unicode programs") to Japanese and reboot. You will see it as well in all of the paths in the cmd window, etc. </FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT size=2>To be clear about GIFT's "mission" here, it is not some neo-imperialistic plan to tell Japanese and Korean users that their expectations built over the last few decades are wrong. It is to deliver that expectation to them.... </FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Now this answer not very specific, but I have talked&nbsp;about specifics before, such as the point I raised <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/09/17/469941.html">last&nbsp;month</A>&nbsp;(inspired by a question from <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/10/14/481044.aspx">Raymond</A>).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But in any case, i</FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>t seemed to me to be worthwhile to say some more about GIFT's actual mission since everyone was bandying the word about.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>We have an actual&nbsp;mission statement:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><EM><FONT size=2>Mission: To enable users, developers, and businesses to realize their full potential worldwide with the best user experience, in the language of their choice, on any device. </FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And the GIFT development team has a mission statement as well:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><EM><FONT size=2>Mission: Develop industry-leading, high-quality, extensible APIs, Tools to enable natural user experiences for customers, in the language and location of their choices, on any device. </FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>This does indeed work as a developer interpretation of how to accomplish that larger vision. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<hr/><p><a id="481312" href="#481312">#</a> <strong>Nick Lamb</strong> on 14 Oct 2005 10:12 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Why does a setting described as &quot;language for non-Unicode programs&quot; change how character U+005c is displayed ? Is that the &quot;natural user experience&quot; for customers?<br><br>At least in this corner it seems as though a small light shines. Exasperated Japanese can tell Windows that their &quot;language for non-Unicode programs&quot; is English, and the OS will (counter-intuitively) continue to be in Japanese, but the fonts will now be fixed, correct ? Are there any other surprises awaiting someone who tries this ?</div>
<p><a id="481319" href="#481319">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 14 Oct 2005 10:53 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">That is a topic in and of itself that I will have to talk about -- all of the effects of the default system locale on Windows typography....</div>

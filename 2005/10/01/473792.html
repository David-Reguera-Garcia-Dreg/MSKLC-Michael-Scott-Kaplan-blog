<P><FONT face=Tahoma>A lot of people do not like South Park very much.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Of course, as it works to shock us, such a reaction can only be expected. Since often the easiest way to shock someone is with some type of vulgarity. And there is no shortage of vulgarity on South Park.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But there is also a very bold tradition, very commonly seen in the Heinlein juveniles and even before that, where the heroes are the children, and the adults can do little more than try to keep up.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I was thinking the other day about the episode that led off the fifth season, entitled <STRONG>It Hits The Fan</STRONG>. In this episode (apparently taking poshots on the <EM>NYPD Blue</EM> episode with non-censored swear words that had people clamoring for at least a month), the network decides to make a bold move and say the word 'shit' without bleeping it. Suddenly everyone is cursing. And a strange disease also seems to be killing people, too. The boys, who have already realized what the adults and network executives have not (that saying the word was much more exciting when it was taboo to say), run into the ancient Knights of Standards and Practices who are guardians trying to keep people from overusing curse words, lest destruction come.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The folks in the South Park Studios even ran a contest in guessing the number of times the word would be used in the episode -- the final number was 162 (only two off of my own guess of 164).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Anyway, there were several interesting and&nbsp;sometimes (dare I say it?) linguistic points buried in the episode:</FONT></P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Eric Cartman's insistence that Meekrob was a curse word, since in his opinion&nbsp;it tasted like shit.</FONT>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>His point being proven later when the word actually was on the list that the knights&nbsp;were working from.</FONT>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>The fact that it was the young boys who figured it all out and saved the day, realizing that curse words (or words of curse) are actually most interesting because they are used sparingly.</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>The idea that censorship should be based on the pragmatic context of who is saying the word -- thus Mr. Garrison as a self-identified homosexual was allowed to say "fag" without being bleeped, while others who were not would be censored.</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Clearly the importance of both content and intent&nbsp;of words should not be underestimated.</FONT></LI></UL>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But at the same time, the lessons were perhaps a little in conflict with each other (probably a side effect of them not being an explicily intended message!). On the one hand, whether to censor speech specifically depends on whether (by some external criteria) you are qualified (for lack of a better term) to say certain terms. And on the other hand, it is a network executive who repeats the swear word continuously without any specific intent other than to prove he could that leads to the earth opening and a fire breathing dragon to come out. Perhaps the message of the censoring is that a word may not actually <EM>be</EM> a curse word if it is used appropriately, by an appropriate person...</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I wonder how such principles would apply to movies like <A href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102266/">The Last Boy Scout</A>, in which the use of swear words per capita may even rival this South Park episode. Or even to the first South Park movie, where Matt and Trey are able to insert one of their own little petty hatreds by getting Barbara Streisand's name&nbsp;to be classed as a curse word that is affected by the V-chip. The irony of how curse words (well, Cartman's 'filthy&nbsp; f***ing mouth') saved the day in the movie while it is the sparing use of and control over such things that saved the day later is also kind of fun.... why be consistent? :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Anyway,&nbsp;I guess the message is that words can be so important that you do not need to fully understand them for them to have an impact. In the words of Talk Radio's Barry Champlain, "Sticks and stones may break our bones, but <STRONG>words</STRONG> cause permanent damage."</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Indeed they might. So we should all look out for those words of curse. And perhaps reconsider whether or not to order the หมี่กรอบ&nbsp;(Meekrob), which in the eyes of Matt and Trey may have been the most important lesson of the episode....</FONT></P>

<p><a id="476110" href="#476110">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 1 Oct 2005 8:51 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Hi Ryan -- I think it is a similar concept, kind of our own self-censorship, if you will. It makes me wonder if these words are swear words to those who use them comfortably, though....</div>
<p><a id="476140" href="#476140">#</a> <strong>Maurits [MSFT]</strong> on 2 Oct 2005 12:59 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Four-letter works in English are mostly Anglo-Saxon in origin.  Their more acceptable Franco-Latin counterparts (fornicate, defecate, urinate etc.) date from the Norman invasion of 1066.  William the Conqueror set up all of his French buddies as regional lords.<br><br>If you wanted to get ahead in England in the late eleventh century, it behooved you to adopt a more French manner of speech, and less of an Anglo-Saxon manner.<br><br>This is /still/ true, almost a millenium later.</div>
<p><a id="476227" href="#476227">#</a> <strong>Heath Stewart</strong> on 2 Oct 2005 1:05 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">As you've pointed out, despite the vulgarity South Park episodes do teach very valuable lessons. I do love the way Matt and Trey poke fun - or bring light to - some of the social blunders of pop culture.</div>
<p><a id="476238" href="#476238">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 2 Oct 2005 2:28 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">I agree Heath, and I also like that when they are allowed they do not mind using those less appropriate but more generally useful words that maurits was speaking against....<br><br>Of course, the lack of consistency can be explained either by the fact that these are small schoolchildren, or more likely that Matt and Trey enjoying being immature. :-)</div>
<p><a id="7919998" href="#7919998">#</a> <strong>Jamie Black</strong> on 27 Feb 2008 11:49 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><P>i hate stupid people</P></div>
<p><a id="8418262" href="#8418262">#</a> <strong> ahsile</strong> on 23 Apr 2008 1:58 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><P>Southpark is absolutely amazing...It has hidden meanings and messages that most people don't catch. And as for it being rude and vulgar- what movie or show isnt anymore? I don't think people pay any attention to it; but if they did they'd realize what an insightful show it was. It raises a lot of questions about what is happening today! HOwever people find it another show with a lot of swearing. Look closer and you'll see the incredibility of the show under all the crude terms and perverse language. </P></div>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>In Windows 2000, support for several of the ISCII (Indian Standard Code for Information Interchange) code pages was added to Windows:</FONT></P><FONT face=Tahoma>

<TD>57004</TD></TR>

<TD>ISCII Telugu</TD>
<TD>57005</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P>
<P>It happened in the same release of Windows that support for some of these Indic languages was first added (more were added in XP, still more in XP SP2, with the final ones being added in Vista.</P>
<P>It leads people to occasionally ask the question that Bob Eaton asked this morning on <A href="http://www.unicode.org/consortium/distlist.html">the Unicode List</A>:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><EM>Does anyone know whether (or why not) it is possible to use the ISCII <BR>Devanagari code page (57002) as the default system code page in Windows?<BR><BR>That is, there is no code page support for "Ansi" Devanagari, but with the <BR>ISCII encoding having code page support, why didn't they associate it with <BR>Ansi programs associated with the Hindi locale (c.f. cp. 932 with JIS) ?<BR><BR>The ISCII encoding seemed like a logical choice... but it wasn't used...</EM></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The answer to the first question is that no you can't, because it is technically impossible. The ANSI and OEM code pages on Windows can act as the ACP and OEMCP for a locale (and the CP_ACP and CP_OEMCP of a default system locale. In order for a code page to be used there it has to be a table-based code page that can be used in both kernel and user modes, not one of "DLL-based" ones that are in the 5xxxx range. And the conversion between ISCII and Unicode is not the simple affair that can be done with a table, it requires a more algorithmic approach....</P>
<P>Additionally, the ANSI Win32 API code throughout Windows has (in many places) a solid "no bigger than two bytes per character" bias, such that any attempt to add a code page that could ever be more than that is not technically possible without updating a great deal of code, code that is provided mainly for backwards compatibility.</P>
<P>So it would have been a logical choice, had it been possible. Unfortunately, it was not. All of these code pages are provided to help move people in India using them to Unicode by allowing them to convert their legacy data....</P>

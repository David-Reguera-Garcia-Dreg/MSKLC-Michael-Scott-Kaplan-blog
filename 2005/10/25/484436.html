<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><EM><FONT face="Times New Roman">First, I'd like to say I enjoy reading your blog. Second, I've got a question about retrieving currency names. I'd like it if you could answer my question (if the solution is even possible). If it's not possible, maybe you could add a blog entry as to why it was decided not to have this available.</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT face="Times New Roman">I'm trying to enumerate all of the currency names for a system (I'm using MFC C++), like the second table in the following MSDN page:</FONT></EM></P></FONT><FONT size=2>

<P><EM><FONT face="Times New Roman">e.g. I would like to programmatically retrieve "Canadian Dollar" from the system. I have no problem getting the ISO symbols, country name, three letter codes (etc) but I can't find a way to get the currency name. It seems like a common thing to list for a country (or it wouldn't be listed in the table on that MSDN page ?!?)</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT face="Times New Roman">Thanks</FONT></EM></P>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Well, first I would like to day thank you very much. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Second, I have some bad news. There is no currency object that can be used to enumerate currency names. However,&nbsp;currency information can be returned for every locale in Windows, by calling the</FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>&nbsp;<A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/intl/nls_34rz.asp">GetLocaleInfo</A>&nbsp;function with either the LOCALE_SENGCURRNAME or LOCALE_SNATIVECURRNAME <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/intl/nls_8rse.asp">LCType</A> values.</FONT></P>

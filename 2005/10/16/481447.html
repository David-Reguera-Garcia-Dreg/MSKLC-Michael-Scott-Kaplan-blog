<h1>Not all stroke counts are created equal</h1>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>One of the problems with sort weights that had to fixed in Vista is the various stroke count sorts.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>You see, everyone wanted to add more ideographs, but the original weights left no room for additions. So there was no way to add them and still have them be valid stroke count sorts! </FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>But we can't just do nothing, not only&nbsp;because of those customer requests but&nbsp;because the bulk of the ideographs people wanted to add had default weights -- so the perceived behavior from customers is broken sorts (several bugs came in descriving such problems, over the years). We obviously had to do something for people.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Ok, so we have to declare a new major version and then make&nbsp;sure to assign weights in a way that leaves room for the future. This is a trap to not get caught in again, believe me.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But what was fascinating was looking at the source data from each of the subsidiary contacts -- each one of them had a different method of doing the stroke counts:</FONT></P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>In Japan, they wanted a radical/stroke based ordering, which involved stroke count, but divided up by each of the radicals and then the ties broken by stroke counts (and then by code point);</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>In China, they wanted a total stroke count, with ties broken based on the order in which strokes were drawn when the character is written correctly (and then by code point);</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>In Taiwan, they also wanted a total stroke count, with ties broken by using the code point values.</FONT></LI></UL>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Looking to the future when new characters might need to be added, room has to be left for such additions in&nbsp;each case. Which is what we ended up doing.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Of course inevitably the question came up -- would we expose this information in some way? Or even should we? I mean who is the customer who needs that level of detail? It obviously does not make sense to give it to competitors, any more than a map maker allows people to copy their maps and resell them. And we do not even have the luxury that the map makers have of adding fictional streets to the map to catch the copiers!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Well, maybe there is some form in which the information would be useful on the platform. It is always worthwhile to think about such things.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Of course even if it made sense to do, the problems in doing so are obviously not trivial -- what generic&nbsp;function could be written that would provide all of that information, when you consider the vast array of different sources and methods?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And doesn't the same issue exist in other languages? I mean obviously the issues are different, but there&nbsp;might still be a commonality, a reason to expose more than we do today to support some type of functionality.</FONT></P><FONT face=Tahoma>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>This is a conversation that spans versions and definitely is one for beyond Vista. It might&nbsp;fit into a sensible area for&nbsp;providing functionality in the future. </FONT>What makes sense to expose, exactly? Perhaps knowing the answer to the WHAT question might lead to sensible answers for the HOW and WHEN questions....</FONT></P>

U+4E16 comes to mind, I learned it as 4 strokes but I've read that it can be written in 5 as well (by writing the &quot;U&quot; shaped part as 3 strokes instead of 2).</div>

Kaplan</strong> on 16 Oct 2005 4:38 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">The data that is given to us make the assumption on official ways to write the characters, espcially the data for China which acually explicitly has a stroke order attached to it.<br><br>If you look at any ideograph, there may be many ways to write it but there is genedrally just one 'official' way to do so according to educators/academics. Where it can get interesting is when those 'official' sources vary, of course.... :-)</div>

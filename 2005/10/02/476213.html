<P><FONT face=Tahoma>That is right, the Unicode train is leaving the station. You might want to make sure to get on board!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I have mentioned before that NLS is not writing new 'A' APIs. We are also recommending the same to other teams; if you are writing new functionality, it is time to remove the additional complication of converting string parameters.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Another factor&nbsp;that I discovered while meeting with MVPs on Friday -- new C++ projects written in Visual Studio 2005 are Unicode by default. So a lot of people will be calling the Unicode functions anyway.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Also in VS 2005, the Resource Editor can understand Unicode .rc files!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Now unfortunately Unicode .RC files are not the default currently; I would love to see this change in a service pack for VS2005&nbsp;-- maybe someone should suggest it over at the MSDN Feedback Center so people can vote on it? :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I'll be posting more on other plans to help with this long-term migration, as they become available. But both inside and outside of Microsoft, the time has come for Unicode....</FONT></P>

<p><a id="479622" href="#479622">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on Tuesday, October 11, 2005 11:12 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Well, that is just it, Mike. Everything that used to work still will. But as we move forward, there will be less and less that you can do with non-Unicode solutions -- a lot of new languages, a lot of new features in general.<br><br>You really will want to start planning, as this is clearly the long term strategy.</div>
<p><a id="479641" href="#479641">#</a> <strong>Mike</strong> on Tuesday, October 11, 2005 12:07 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Agreed that it is the way to go, and should also be done to &quot;set a good example&quot;, but in certain cases it makes sense to provide some ANSI versions, e.g. when you talk about string based APIs for code pages (custom or not), you *are* dealing with code pages, which is more likely to be done in a non-Unicode app.</div>

Kaplan</strong> on Tuesday, October 11, 2005 12:23 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">I did not mention anything about string based APIs for code pages? There are none.<br><br>The official policy of this group, started in Server 2003, is no more. It is time to move to Unicode....</div>

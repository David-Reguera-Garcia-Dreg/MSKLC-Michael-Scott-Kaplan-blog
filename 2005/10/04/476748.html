<P><FONT face=Tahoma>There Cathy and I were, early on Saturday morning, the last day of the 2005 MVP Summit.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>All day yesterday, Mike and Mihai, our two 'internationalization' MVPs (technically Platform SDK MVPs, but both with a definite internationalization focus) spent the day with the GIFT team.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It was kind of funny to think about -- all of the other MVPs were moving around from place to place for the various presentations they had on their schedule. Our MVPs, on the other hand, got to stay in one place and all of the people from the GIFT team came to where the MVPs&nbsp;were all day. The GIFT team members thought it was great to meet with the MVPs and get opinions and feedback on short-term and long term-plans. And both of the MVPs though it was great to be given an awesome day with so many meetings. Everybody won!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It was a lot of fun to put together and it was great to be a part of it all.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So anyway, now it was Saturday, and a day that Cathy did all the planning for -- a presentation covering all of the great internationalization features in Vista.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Technically, she really had the harder job than I did for the day she had planned, since I did not have to do any slides while she had to do a 90 minute presentation, followed by a 90 minute panel.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>We knew that the almost 90 Shell MVPs who were inivited had three choices for the day:</FONT></P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Cathy's presentation</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>A presentation given by some people in PSS</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Sleeping in after the Summit party that went until midnight the night before</FONT></LI></UL>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Since no one had even registered for which option they planned to do, we had no idea what to expect, but we had a decent crowd, anyway. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I volunteered to be on the panel, and also to be the slide boy and do a demo (Matt was also there, to do another demo). The presentation was awesome, and covered a lot of ground (I am sure the slides will get a lot of use over the net while!).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And we had a bunch of people from GIFT there for the panel, it was really cool.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>We then got some really awesome questions, and some bugs and suggestions to follow up on (Perhaps I'll blog about a few of them at some point!).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Then for Saturday night the Access MVPs invited me to a dinner, which was also really nice -- like old times, seeing old friends.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>All and all&nbsp;the Summit was a&nbsp;really nice event (much bigger than ones I have been to in the past!).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Though I think it would make sense to put a little more flexibility into the scheduling of some internationalization talks, opening it up to more of the MVPs if they are interested. I think there may be a fair amount of interest across many of the products covered by the various MVPs, so it would be cool to offer up something as an option to a larger group of them. Ah well, some ideas to pitch to the planners, perhaps there will be some interest....</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>There are those who believe that me telling folks how to not step in it does not make too much sense. But I would argue that my misteps are not as bad as the one I am mentioning here tonight.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>As reported&nbsp;in <A href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/10/04/taiwan_google_earth/">The Register</A>, there are people in Taiwan who are not especially happy with Google at the moment,&nbsp;with its labeling of Taiwan as a province of China in Google Earth. And as is typical of The Register, they are of course making fun of the issue as they report it.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Are they all 12 years old over at the Register? The one advantage to stories that start there is that even when they end up on <A href="http://politics.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/10/04/1655204">/.</A> there is nowhere to go but up. If you know what I mean.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Of course all of those former Microsofties at Google should have perhaps paid more attention to issue with lines in the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/08/22/54679.aspx">time zone map</A>&nbsp;before they left; it might have saved them the pain of dealing with this issue,&nbsp;just as it did&nbsp;for the folks at&nbsp;<A href="http://virtualearth.msn.com/default.aspx?cp=23.746596|120.940546&amp;style=h&amp;lvl=8&amp;v=1">MSN Virtual Earth</A>.</FONT></P>

And deriding GOOG for their mistake isn't going to knock their halo off, so it's also ineffectual.<br/><br/>Feel free to moderate this out and disallow the comment. The comment is really meant for you only.<br/><br/>- Drew</div>

And it isn't like I have been shy about pointing out MS mistakes here when I think they are mistakes.<BR><BR>In the case of Google, it is the side effect of being young and brash. It boils down to a mistake, and perhaps a tiny bit of evil (probably unintentional). But this is not an attempt to knock their halo off, it is actually a bit more cautionary than that....</div>

Like the slogan says &quot;Biting the hand that feeds IT&quot;. It hardly seems sensible here to accuse El Reg of being unprofessional when two grown countries can't settle such a simple dispute after so many years. And it's not as though they're alone, the US has a list of territorial disputres as long as your arm.<br><br>As to Google, well it's very popular these days for Microsoft bloggers to take a swipe at Google in passing. Not so long ago Google was beneath their notice. I don't think I need to quote Gandhi here do I? I imagine they'll write &quot;Taiwan&quot;, and then ignore further letters on the subject until China actually invades or formally accepts that it's an independent nation.<br><br>Anyway I can't tell what MSN VE does that's so clever here, unless it is that they replace most of the island of Taiwan with grey rectangles. I guess that avoids labelling it, while appearing like a harmless software bug? OTOH Google Earth, while having an unfortunate label for the island in question does at least show what's on it...</div>

It did not label it a country (which would upset China), it did not label it a province (which would upset Taiwan). Easy solution in labelling....<br><br>I have a sense of humor, I just didn't think that it was all that funny.<br><br>As for the Google thing, it was not too heavy of a swipe. But they may want to learn a thing or two about the world while they are trying to cover it, in my opinion.</div>

But it's not up to Google Maps to set right any political injustices, or claim to resolve any political disagreements.</div>

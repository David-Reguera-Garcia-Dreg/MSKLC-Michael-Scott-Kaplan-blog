<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Apparently, my existing home mortgage is very impressive.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Because starting in June of this year I have been getting a lot of e-mail claiming that it makes me eligible for a decreased rate (as of midnight 4/26!).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>What makes my mortgage most impressive is that I never had to sign&nbsp;any papers to get it. And I never have to pay any money back. </FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>On the other hand, I never received any money, either.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I don't even have a home; I live in an apartment.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I won't get into how annoying spam is, I think we all know about that. But I did find one interesting fact about all these mails -- they all follow the same pattern. Here is how they all start:</FONT></P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And so on (there are many more, but you probably get the point).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Every one is different, and it makes you feel like there is some script that runs and creates these random mails that follow the same basic structure but plug in words, presumably to confound email spam detectors.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Of course, the link that each one offers also seems to be different, and I have never followed any of them (even if it were genuine, they could never beat my current mortgage!).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But what was weird was how I looked at it, from a linguistic standpoint.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The first one ever sent, I dismissed as spam since it referred to a mortgage that did not exist and the English seemed off to me.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But as they started piling up, I still knew it was spam, but I started to realize that knowledge of English would probably be required to be able to have more variations than anything short of a thesaurus could offer. Perhaps that comes from some script writer, but clearly someone has to have some idea of how the language works.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So it struck me as both brilliant and idiotic:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>BRILLIANT because sooner or later they might get the syntax right, and really they are not trying to; they just want to avoid spm detection.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>IDIOTIC because on the first day four of them. Only a fellow idiot would actually jump up to take the offer.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It makes me wonder why they bother -- do people fall for this nonsense?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Imagine if they used their power for good?</FONT></P>

You know, these people who sell blue pills to me are very serious. You know me, I wouldn't by a cat in a bag (OK, this is literal translation from french but since your blog is about i18n, I thought the bad translation wouldn't be a problem ;-) ), I mean... I'm not an idiot. And I'll tell you what, these pills are great. I'm very confident that they will soon have a very positive effect on my [...] life. Of course, it's serious stuff, not magic. It is therefore normal that the effect is not noticeable immediately or even within weeks.<br><br>&gt; Imagine if they used their power for good?<br><br>They do, Michael.

Anyhow before Outlook got the junk filters adequadately working, permanently auto-deleting any mail with mortgage worked pretty well among other words... It's a bit amusing they try use all those words but just having mortgage in it is usually enough to tell it spam.</div>

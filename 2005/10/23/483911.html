<P><FONT face=Tahoma><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/drintl/">Dr. International</A> recently posted about using alternate keyboard characters as a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/482832.aspx">method of enhancing security</A>. I am of two minds on this issue.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>On the one hand, any method you use that makes it harder for password checkers is potentially interesting, and the trick that Dr. International talks about seems to do just that.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>On the other hand, I look at white papers like <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/smallbusiness/support/articles/select_sec_passwords.mspx">Selecting Secure Passwords</A>&nbsp;that talk about many characters that this trick apparently will not work for (the characters get mapped to easy letters that would make for less secure pasword choices -- the white paper warns that you could end up with something much less secure).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Clearly the ALT+Numpad text handler is doing much more than meets the eye here. I'd have to suggest avoiding it, at least until some more clarity happens on what really takes place&nbsp;in the login dialog situation.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The table in that white paper certainly brought me up short....</FONT></P>

The first table has a &quot;...&quot; after &quot;a, b, c&quot;... implying that there are more than three letters.  But the Unicode entry has four entries, with no &quot;...&quot;, implying that there are exactly four Unicode characters. :)<br><br>It's good to see that a good word is put in for including characters from multiple character classes.  Certainly dictionary words are weak passwords, and forcing multiple character classes takes care of the dictionary problem.<br><br>But...<br><br>l33t isn't all that strong a way to force inclusion.<br><br>If a hacker is willing to crack using a dictionary, it doesn't seem all that hard to modify the dictionary algorithm to:<br><br>1) Try all the words in the dictionary<br>2) Try all the words in the dictionary, making one l33t-substitution<br>3) Try all the words in the dictionary, making two l33t-substitutions<br>4) ...<br><br>And it shouldn't take more than a couple of thousand times as long to crack the average l33t-substituted password using this algorithm.</div>

The full NTLM hash should use the characters, unmodified.  I might be wrong though...  Also, you can disable LM hashing, but only if you don't have any Windows 9X or Mac clients on your network.  See: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=KB;EN-US;q299656&amp;">http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=KB;EN-US;q299656&amp;</a><br><br>I would tend to agree, though, that using extended characters for passwords is probably not that good an idea.  Even for the &quot;sensitive&quot; accounts - in fact, *especially* for sensitive account.  The thing is, you're not often going to log in as domain admin, so you need to use a password that you're going to  remember.  It would be much better to have a nice long pass phrase that you can actually remember than some shorter &quot;strong&quot; password that you have to write down to remember.</div>

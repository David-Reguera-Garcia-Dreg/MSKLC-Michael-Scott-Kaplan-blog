<P><FONT face=Tahoma>On <A href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/">Language Log</A>, Bill Poser posted about how <A href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002678.html">Icelandic Studies are Shifting to English</A>, quoted in part here:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><EM><FONT size=2>This isn't an entirely unfamiliar development: there are other fields in which foreigners play a major, if not the major, role. Indeed, it is really what we should expect. So long as a field attracts the interest of outsiders, given that the number of outsiders is larger, often much larger, than the number of natives, statistically speaking we should expect to see foreigners play the larger role. Of course, disparities in access to education and interest in scholarship will affect the relative prominence of different countries, as will differences in access to important resources and motivation. No one should be surprised that Arabs are not prominent in glaciology or that few experts on camels are Scandinavian. </FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>His post&nbsp;made me think of the role that language plays in locales, for some reason.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Every locale has things such as the language name and the country name in three different languages for a given install:</FONT></P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>The name in the native language of the locale</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>The name in English</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>The name in the language of the particular localized installation of Windows</FONT></LI></UL>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I guess that means that we have English as some kind of ultimate&nbsp;fallback, the localized language as the preferred one to show, and the native language as the one that not every person will know for every single locale (imagine if using Windows required you to know 100 languages!).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>When you add the <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/02/10/370460.html">Language Interface Pack (LIP)</A> concept to the mix, something interesting happens. Because this is a partial localization based on what people would most frequently see and expect to see in their native language, the decision of whether to translate those lists of languages and countries and such is an individual one made by the localizer. Which brings me inevitably back to Bill's post and why it got me thinking about this whole issue:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT size=2><EM>What is interesting here is that the subject in question is the sort that is often taken to be at the heart of the national character, one that only a native can fully appreciate. One hesitates to imagine the reaction to a proposal that French university courses on mediaeval French language, literature, and history should be conducted in English on the grounds that foreign scholars now dominate the field.</EM></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Since the localizer's job here is in many ways an advocate for the target language to which they are working to appropriately translate, similar decisions have to be made for every string, especially when it is a string that is easy to see in a user interface that is not commonly launched (Regional and Language Options, in this case).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I would hesitate to imagine the reaction if the French localization of Windows did not translate this list (luckily French is not a partial localization so we do not have to find out!).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But it is fascinating to contemplate this particular aspect of the localizer's job in the LIP scenario, which almost becomes an extended version of the "Lifeboat" scenario as what to take on the boat and what to leave is decided. Especially when (inevitably) non-native testers of the LIP will file bug reports about strings that are not translated, since there is no way for them to know if a string not translated was missed by oversight or by a decision that lies at the heart of the national character....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Thanks for the inspiration, Bill. :-)</FONT></P>

I am going to have to face this with my document-management and -processing hat on some day soon, and I can just see how this makes the librarian localization problem real.  <br><br>These are great examples of how proceduralization of reality stubs its toe, of course.  There's never enough context.  I wonder how we can let the user drive and get a sane results.</div>

That would give you objective feedback on how good of a job your localizers are doing (or on how controversial a particular language is.)</div>
<p><a id="499120" href="#499120">#</a> <strong>Maurits [MSFT]</strong> on 1 Dec 2005 5:20 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Or perhaps the &quot;original source&quot; should have a quality of 1, and all translations should have a quality of .8?<br><br>That way a person whose primary language is Chinese (say) but who speaks English very well (0.9) would see English text...<br><br>but a native Chinese speaker who speaks English only slightly (0.5) would see Chinese text first, and English only if no Chinese text was available.</div>

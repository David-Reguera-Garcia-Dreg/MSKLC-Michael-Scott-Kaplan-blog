<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The other day, I talked about how a particular scene in the movie Good Morning Vietnam <STRONG><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/12/12/502513.html">did not look like Vietnamese to me</A></STRONG>, despite some claims of others to the contrary.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The comments then did talk a bit about the apparent variation in the English, French, and Chinese&nbsp;translations.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I thought I would share the rest of the subtitles that the movie within the movie (Beach Blanket Bingo) was sporting.....</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I guess people can now independently look at the variability in the translation.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I do not have the original movie or a transcript thereof to judge the accuracy of the English (one of the other questions that was raised), but I thought this might be something, at least....</FONT></P>

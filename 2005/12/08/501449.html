<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I was reminded of a quote from Martin Cruz Smith's Gorky Park the other day:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><EM>Arkady's throat was dry and he took a long drink. "There are not many road signs in Russia, you know." He laughed. "If you don't know where a road goes, you shouldn't be on it."</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>A few years ago, I found out that there were certain jokes I could tell when I was doing technical presentations that would always get a laugh.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>For some reason, if I do a technical talk about Jet replication and mention that the way to make the .MDB file replicable is to set the Replicable property to (wait for it) "The letter <STRONG>T</STRONG>", for some reason people laugh. I have no idea why, as it never seemed all that funny to me, it actually seemed kind of dumb. But for some reason, it sounds silly enough that it manages to get a laugh.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>In internationalization talks, I sometimes talk about MUI and inevitably while I show the language list (see below)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><IMG src="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/Images/changeUI/xp-mui.gif"></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>someone will ask me why the list of user interface languages is not translated so that it could be understood. It really does not matter how often folks have heard it before; when I suggest that this is a protection for customers -- if you cannot read the language name then you&nbsp;should&nbsp;not try to switch to it (since you may not be able to make it back to a language you <STRONG>do</STRONG> understand!).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I thought about all this </FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>yesterday, when&nbsp;Adam asked me in email:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT size=2><EM>AppLocale asks me, which locale I'd like to launch the application with -- see screenshot. I'm trying to pick Japanese. Any tips? My guess is that the two entries with boxes and parantheses are the two kinds of Chinese. Hence, Japanese is either the last or the second-last. I guess the last.</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><EM>In other words: why not include an English translation of the locales in parantheses in the AppLocale UI?</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><EM>Regards,<BR>Adam</EM></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Adam also sent me the following screenshot, and I must say a picture is worth 1000 words:</FONT></P>
<P><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/applocale.png"></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It is&nbsp;a fair question. Not everyone speaks fluent NULL GLYPH, do they? :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Now I would be the first to admit that this is not the best customer experience in the world. But usually when this happens it means that East Asian language support has not yet been installed. And if that is the case then the Japanese application is not going to fare any better than the language list. So one again my restatement of Arkady Renko's words come to mind -- if you can't read the language in the list then&nbsp;you probably won't be able to read the application later....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>We can of course use a little forensic globalization to puzzle it out. Attend&nbsp;me:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Clearly the first two entries are probably 中文(简体)&nbsp;and 中文(繁体) -- Chinese (Simplified) and Chinese (Traditional). Since AppLocale is being run so presumably it is an ANSI application, so all you have to do is try the second last entry and then the last one. The one that is Korean will come up with a bunch of&nbsp;question&nbsp;marks, and the one that is Japanese will come up with a bunch of NULL GLYPHS. And then you will know which entry is Japanese.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Now you know I work&nbsp;for Microsoft, Adam -- I managed to give an answer that would you give you a completely correct answer that is&nbsp;of no real use whatsoever. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Now it turns out that there was something wrong with Adam's font linking, as the problem resolved itself by him turning EA support off and then on again. Usually that suggests the installation of thir party programs that muck with the font linking (I try to avoid those sorts of programs as they can wreak all kinds of havoc with a machine. The fact that lots of non-Unicode programs were also running are not by any means proof of this, but it is common to see these various issues happening on the same machine.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Now I'll talk about the order of the language list another day. :-)</FONT></P>

I did succeed in reaching my host at his office desk (thank goodness for workaholics) and he bailed me out.  That taught me to notice how foreigner-hostile our infrastructure and telecommunications are, and how mandatory voice-response menu systems and other creative notions make it worse [;&lt;).</div>

<p><a id="501731" href="#501731">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on Thursday, December 08, 2005 3:50 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Yes, but that violates the principle -- if you don't know the language, you should not switch to it.<br><br>If we translate, you may think the UI will be translated later too....</div>
<p><a id="501797" href="#501797">#</a> <strong>Nick Lamb</strong> on Thursday, December 08, 2005 6:00 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">How interesting, the locale configuration for this Red Hat system is localised, but the actual list of choices is not. It appears that no matter what your locale the list shows the English name first, with the native name afterwards. ie the entry for German will always read &quot;German (Germany) Deutsch&quot; even if your machine is set up for Korean.<br><br>I suspect that in earlier non-Unicode incarnations of this software the English name was always readable, while the native name might (as in Michael's images above) be unprintable in the current locale. If you can't read it, how will you know to switch to it? So perhaps the English translations will disappear in a future version.</div>

Microsoft's and &quot;Red Hat&quot;'s (whatever that may be)<br><br>To wit:<br>Microsoft: Everybody speaks every language in the world<br>Red Hat: Everybody speaks English<br><br>Why doesn't anyone use the solution I propose?<br><br>Ockham's razor to the rescue!<br><br>Because my proposed solution entails generating an n-by-n matrix of every language name, localized to every language name.<br><br>Microsoft's solution entails only an n-vector of every language name /in it's own language./<br><br>Red Hat's solution entails two n-vectors... the Microsoft n-vector, plus another n-vector of every language name /in English./<br><br>Both are much easier than the n-by-n matrix.<br><br>So 'fess up, Michael, and &quot;Red Hat&quot; guy... you're both just trying to avoid localizing every language name to every language, right?</div>

I'm proficient in French so I can muddle my way around the other Romance languages pretty well.

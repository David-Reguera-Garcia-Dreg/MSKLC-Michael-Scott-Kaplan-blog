<P>I have talked previously about the Enabling Language Kits in many posts, such as <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/01/26/360685.html"><STRONG>Lions and tigers and <STRIKE><FONT color=#808080>bears</FONT></STRIKE>ELKs, Oh my!</STRONG></A> and <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/08/09/449405.html"><STRONG>ELK stampede!</STRONG></A> (and of course referred to them in many others).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>They are an incredible way to enable a larger number of locales in Windows XP, a feature that adds unprecedented levels of locale support to the Windows platform.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Of course the very first question I remember being asked by developers working on the Office team:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=5>How do you install them on Windows Server 2003?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The answer did admittedly shock them -- <EM>you don't</EM>.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>(This apparently caused them some trouble since all of their developer machines were using Server 2003 -- prior to XP SP2 shipping, there was little doubt that the Server 2003 release was more secure!)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>ELKs are for XP, and the data fornat of locale data does have some subtle differences that would make porting the ELK locales to Server 2003 difficult.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And since the most important reason for the ELK functionality is to support Language Interface Packs (which I talk about <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/02/10/370460.html">here</A>), which do not have as a requirement support on servers, the extra effort that would be required could not be justified,&nbsp;especially since it would have&nbsp;taken away resources from both the 2.0 version of the .NET Framework and what we called at the time Longhorn.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Now I know that there are some "client" scenarios buried in the server, such as both web servers and terminal servers. </FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>But when you consider that you cannot install more than a single Language Interface Pack on a machine, it obviously is not a 'client' scenario to add LIP support, even in those 'client-like' scenarios.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>In any case,&nbsp;a very careful triaging of the impact on everything we had (and have) to deliver was done, and all of these issues were considered. </FONT></P>

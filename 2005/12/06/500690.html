<h1>Sample usage of the FindNLSString function</h1>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma><EM>(this post is a blatant attempt to overcome writer's block by appealing to my readers!)</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I have to write some useful examples that show a particular NLS API function in action. You know, so people will know why they should use it, and&nbsp;perhaps also how.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The function is FindNLSString, the one I have talked about&nbsp;previously <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/07/31/445819.html">here</A>.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Now I have always had&nbsp;trouble with the Platform SDK samples, because there is so much code there that it can be hard to distill from a full sample the small bit you want to use. This is even harder with NLS functions since you may not know how to type all the characters you wanted to test out with. So I think a conceptual topic may be clearer in this case.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The trouble now is that I cannot think of examples to give in the conceptual topic.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So, before I jump in and just start writing example calls, does anyone have any thoughts on what they would like to see in a conceptual topic on using the <A href="http://windowssdk.msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/Intl/nls_FindNLSString.asp">FindNLSString</A> function? :-)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>This screenshot is from the movie Good Morning, Vietnam -- the brief period where we are watching Beach Blanket Bingo with what I have seen reported as Vietnamese, and French subtitles in places like <A href="http://www.wlajournal.com/14_1-2/230-238kunz.pdf">this document</A>.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But that middle language does not look like it could be Vietnamese. Well, I mean unless it is 17th century or earlier Vietnamese which was more likely to be ideographic.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Maybe it is just me. Or could it be Chinese, perhaps? If memory serves, the actual dub for the audio was Vietnamese (other than when Frankie and Annette are singing)....</FONT></P>

Maybe there are a lot of Chinese people living in Vietnam?</div>

<p><a id="502673" href="#502673">#</a> <strong>Gabe</strong> on 12 Dec 2005 5:48 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">If the audio was in Vietnamese, why would they need subtitles in the same language? It makes sense that the subtitles would be in English, French, and Chinese.</div>
<p><a id="502697" href="#502697">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 12 Dec 2005 8:39 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">I agree, Gabe -- though I wonder that different sites say the subtitles are in English, French, and Vietnamese....<br><br>Seems like common sense that it would not be.</div>
<p><a id="502699" href="#502699">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 12 Dec 2005 8:40 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Duncan -- I know, but it has been centuries since it has been used. I doubt a movie would be subtitled with it....</div>
<p><a id="502771" href="#502771">#</a> <strong>Michael Dunn_</strong> on 12 Dec 2005 12:18 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">To make it even more odd, the French says &quot;if they dropped her&quot;.</div>
<p><a id="502822" href="#502822">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 12 Dec 2005 2:00 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">I am hoping that the various differences in traslation are due to the fact that only pieces of sentences are being handled at a time -- so the three will not usually be in sync.<br><br>If not then they ought to fire a few of them.... :-)</div>
<p><a id="502861" href="#502861">#</a> <strong>Maurits [MSFT]</strong> on 12 Dec 2005 3:51 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">It seems likely to me that the makers of Good Morning, Vietnam probably looked for an already-made Vietnamese version of an American film rather than making one.<br><br>So any mistakes are likely to be &quot;authentic&quot; mistakes. :)<br><br>&quot;if they dropped her&quot; sounds like a reasonable translation of &quot;if they passed her up&quot; -- translation of popular media is only partly about literal translations, and is heavily about conveying the &quot;sense&quot; of the words.<br><br>No clue on the Chinese translation.<br><br>Here's a question... are the French and Chinese translations made directly from the original English, or are they &quot;second-generation copies&quot; of the Vietnamese translation?<br><br>And is the English the original English, or is it a re-translation from the Vietnamese?<br><br>Anyone have a copy of Beach Blanket Bingo?</div>
<p><a id="503398" href="#503398">#</a> <strong>Jonas Grumby</strong> on 13 Dec 2005 8:21 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">I think &quot;if they let her fall&quot; is a more literal translation than &quot;if they dropped her&quot;.  Also, it's potentially an idiom beyond my 4 years of French (il y a douze ans).  I'm willing to believe that the French translation is correct.</div>

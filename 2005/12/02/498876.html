<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The other day, Izzy asked in the microsoft.public.dotnet.internationalization newsgroup:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT size=2>I want to use a calendar web control that will display a non-gregorian calendar. When setting the CultureInfo.DateTimeFormat.Calendar = new Calendar() it works but the language is the Culture's language, and I want it to be displayed in English. E.g. When trying to display a Hebrew Calendar I will use the following code in Page_Load:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Courier New" size=2>CultureInfo ilCulture = new CultureInfo("he-IL");<BR>ilCulture.DateTimeFormat.Calendar = new HebrewCalendar();<BR>Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture = ilCulture;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>This will display a HebrewCalendar but the HebrewCalendar will be displayed in Hebrew, and I want it to be displayed in English. Is it possible? How?</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Those of you who are familiar with the limitations of calendars, or those of you <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/01/14/353216.html"><STRONG>following</STRONG></A><STRONG> </STRONG><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/02/23/378804.html"><STRONG>issues</STRONG></A><STRONG> </STRONG><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/01/14/353347.html"><STRONG>here</STRONG></A>&nbsp;probably know, the answer is not a&nbsp;happy one for Izzy -- there is no way to do it.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The only fully localized calendar is the Gregorian calendar. Thinking back to yesterday when I asked <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/12/01/498866.html"><STRONG>What Language to Use?</STRONG></A>, the native language is the only one present for most calendars, the localized name is there for Gregorian only, and the English name is not available anywhere.</FONT></P><FONT face=Tahoma>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Though to be honest, it bothers me more that the Hijri calendar is always in Arabic (even in the Divehi language's locale, where it makes no sense) than the Hebrew calendar is always in Hebrew. Because truthfully in the context of the Hebrew calendar it is in the most sensible language already, and having it in localized or even English form is not quite as important....</FONT></P>
<P>In any case, yet another way that calendars are not all there yet in Windows and the .NET Framework? :-(</FONT></P>

<p><a id="499337" href="#499337">#</a> <strong>David</strong> on 2 Dec 2005 7:35 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">An interesting thing I ran across the other day. If you have your UI language set to one language and your locale set to another, you get a mixed effect in the Windows calendar. See <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/exold/69341695/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/exold/69341695/</a> for an example (here I have UI language = Spanish (Mexico), locale = French (France)). Note the month name.<br>This is probably as intended, but it looks a little weird.</div>
<p><a id="499339" href="#499339">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 2 Dec 2005 7:47 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Hi David -- That particular calendar is largely broken, it should not be using the UI language there. That problem is being addressed in Vista.... And note this happens only for Gregorian, which actually has the loocalizable strings for locales (the UI language strings would not be used here).</div>
<p><a id="499340" href="#499340">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 2 Dec 2005 7:50 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Hi Ilya --<br><br>Outlook does that sort of thing by providing their own support here rather than using the support in Windows or the .NET Framework. :-)</div>
<p><a id="499449" href="#499449">#</a> <strong>orcmid</strong> on 2 Dec 2005 12:45 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">This is juicy stuff.  Now you've got me champing at the bit to start pulling material together on situating data and non-psychic interaction design.  There's a book or something in all of this.<br><br>But, but, there's already too much to do and too many promises to keep.  Ah well, I can keep reading and building my clipping files of all of these goodies ... [;&lt;).</div>

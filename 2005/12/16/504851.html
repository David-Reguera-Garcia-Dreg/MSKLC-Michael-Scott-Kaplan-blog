<P><FONT face=Tahoma>A few days ago, David Anson (a developer at Microsoft who I swear I saw here on an occasional email as long ago as late 1998? Maybe I am mis-remembering) sent me the following piece of mail:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P>I know you blog on funky Unicode characters, but MSN Search didn't find a blog on this guy yet. I've got a text analysis tool I maintain that I've just patched with the following comment:</P>
<P><FONT face="Courier New" color=#008000 size=2><STRONG>// Per </STRONG></FONT><A href="http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0080.pdf"><FONT face="Courier New" color=#008000 size=2><STRONG>http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0080.pdf</STRONG></FONT></A><FONT face="Courier New" color=#008000 size=2><STRONG>, character \u0084 is<BR>// a C1 Control (IND/Index) and causes rendering of text it is in to<BR>// end prematurely. It needs to be substituted with a harmless<BR>// replacement in order to avoid partial line rendering. Testing with<BR>// "All char values.txt" suggests this is the only such character.</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P>What's up with that?!? :)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Now David also mentioned that his tool was a managed one, although after looking into this a bit I might have guessed anyway (I will explain why in a moment).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Unicode of course has little to say about either the C0 or the C1 control character, since it inherited them from the ISO-8859 standards, each of which include these characters.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Now the&nbsp;<STRONG><A href="http://www.iso.ch/iso/en/StandardsQueryFormHandler.StandardsQueryFormHandler?keyword=8859&amp;sortOrder=ISO&amp;scopecatalogue=CATALOGUE&amp;scopeprogramme=PROGRAMME&amp;title=true&amp;cacheid=6125302">ISO-8859-* standards</A></STRONG> (per the ISO site,m they each seem to cost 64.00 CHF -- 49.41 USD by today's fix -- so no I am not going to go purchase all 15 of the ones that are available) are probably not worth purchasing anyway if you wanted more information on them&nbsp;-- they do not have any, really.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Perhaps the <A href="http://www.iso.ch/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=12782&amp;scopelist="><STRONG>ISO-6429 standard</STRONG></A> (Control functions for coded character sets) would help for most characters, but don't waste the 188.00 CHF (145.72 USD by today's fix) because ISO-6429 includes the names for all of the control characters <EM>with the exception of</EM> U+0080, U+0081, U+0084, and U+0099. So there is no help there, either.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Finally, with some time pounding the Internet beat a bit I did find several of the <STRONG>IND</STRONG> and <STRONG>Index</STRONG> entries (places like decodeunicode.org), but none of them really explained even a&nbsp;mesning for the name, let alone a source.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So I took a step back and thought about David's claim -- that it seemed to act in some way to break the line in a Microsoft product -- and took a look at&nbsp;some Microsoft products. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I&nbsp;used the string of characters U+0080 - U+0099 (the C1 control characters): ""</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>In the textbox into which I am typing right now, U+0085 is coming up as a blank and the rest come up as NULL GLYPHS -- there is definitely no line break at U+0084.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>In notepad, it is all NULL GLYPHS.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I'll&nbsp;try Wordpad -- that looks like my earlier textbox experience.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>How about Word 2003? Same thing.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Ok, it might be time to give up on hints here, time to look at&nbsp;some source....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>(a bit of time passes as I am looking)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Ok, I found something!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>There is a collection of characters in GDI+ (of which U+0084 is a part) that if a linebreak is needed, it is considered a linebreak opportunity. It even has a name for the code -- WCH_LINEBREAK. And an alternate name -- wchEndLineInPara.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Now the GDI+ behavior and the code seems a bit too intentional to be accidental. So although I am still not sure about the source, I am sure I have written enough to call it a character story! :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

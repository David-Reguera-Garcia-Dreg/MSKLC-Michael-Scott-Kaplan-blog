Because we add more and more all the time.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The latest is&nbsp;the <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=0DB2E8F9-79C4-4625-A07A-0CC1B341BE7C&amp;displaylang=mi">Maori Language Interface Pack for Windows XP</A> was just released!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Some background about Māori:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT size=2><EM>Language nearly exclusive spoken in New Zealand, mostly by people of Maori descent. The Maori language was recognized as second official language of New Zealand in 1987 (the other being English).</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><EM>It was the predominant language in New Zealand until the 1860s, then became a minority language in the shadow of English. In the 1970s concerns about the decline of Maori initiated a multitude of activities to support the survival and growth of the language. One of the language recovery programs is the Kohanga Reo (“language nests”) movement in which language immersion centers were established for pre-school children. Today 13,000 children are enrolled in more than 700 kohanga reo centers throughout New Zealand. There are less primary and secondary schools that continue the language exposure, but Kura Kaupapa, a primary school program in Māori, is a first step to address that issue.</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><EM>With ten consonants and five vowels Maori has the richest phonological inventory of all East Polynesian languages, and the number of its speakers exceeds that of any other Polynesian language. </EM></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>From a personal standpoint, Maori is a language that Cathy and I were&nbsp;helping out with&nbsp;on years ago, working on creating a keyboard layout years before <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/tools/msklc.mspx">MSKLC</A> made it so much easier to do that sort of thing. So it seems especially awesome to see how far we have come (from a simple keyboard available&nbsp;for download all the way to an entire Language Interface Pack!).</FONT></P>

Congratulations!<br><br>Although localizing into a language with only 15 characters (like Māori) should be way easier than translating into a language with thousands of characters (like Chinese)<br>;-)<br></div>

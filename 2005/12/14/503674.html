<P><FONT face=Tahoma>A user with the amusing handle of IDisposable asked me the following question via the contact link:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><STRONG><FONT size=2><EM>Title: Am I nuts?</EM></FONT></STRONG></P><FONT size=2>
<P><EM>Could you check this Ladybug report for me? I think it is bad code, but I'm not versed enough in the String.Compare(x,x,x,x,StringComparison.OrdinalIngoreCase) to be sure...</EM></P>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Well, I don't think IDisposable is nuts, but he is incorrect.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>As I have often stated here, Ordinal comparisons are binary ones, not language specific ones.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And OrdinalIgnoreCase is not ignoring case in a language-specific way, so there is no way that language differences can affect the casing part of the operation.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>To make a further somewhat related point, currently in Microsoft products there is no casing operation that will change the length of a string -- the casing tables map one UTF-16 code&nbsp;unit to another, and even in .NET where casing of supplementary characters has been added, you always convert two UTF-16 code code units to two other ones. So the length will remain constant.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Of course linguistic comparisons do a bit more than that (as I pointed out in <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/03/10/391564.html">this</A> post and <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/04/10/406880.html">this</A> one, too), not to mention issues such as Unicode canonical equivalance that definitely let different length strings be equal. But neither Ordinal nor OrdinalIgnoreCase comparisons do anything like that....</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The other day, Raoul contacted me with the following question:</FONT></P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT size=2>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><EM><FONT face="Times New Roman">I found your blog doing trying to figure out a warning I'm currently getting in VS2005, and am hoping you might be able to help me out. Sorry to bother you...</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT face="Times New Roman">My company's currently considering switching to VS2005, and in one of our files a C4819 error has popped up twice now for no obvious reason... We had one other file with the error and there were a few bad characters in there, but in the problem file, I can't seem to find anything that's actually broken... In fact, if I put a #pragma warning(disable:4819) around the block that gets the warning, the file compiles fine, but if I delete the block in question, the error is still there... does this make sense at all? I guess we could add the warning to our project ignore list, but that seems like a waste of valid information...</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE></FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Raoul is talking about one or both of the following posts:</FONT></P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/01/05/347394.html">The new compiler error C4819</A></FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/01/08/349230.html">How does it detect invalid characters?</A></FONT></LI></UL>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>One of the problems that can come up is something invalid that does not have a visible representation, or something that looks close enough to a valid character to escape attempts to find the problem.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>In the end, the easiest way I have found to deal with this is to open the file in Notepad and then use "File | Save as..." to save it as an ANSI file. This will convert the bad character(s) to the <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/12/03/499661.html">default character</A> which should be easy to spot (or at least easier).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I think there is an option to do this in Visual Studio, too -- but I have not looked into that yet. And Notepad is something I know. :-)</FONT></P>

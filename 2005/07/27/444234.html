<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I am posting this so that maybe people will no longer feel like they need to <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/contact.aspx">contact</A> me to tell me that the RSS 2.0 and Atom 0.3 links are out of order. I know they are.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I hav actually been looking at my stats for the first time -- it is&nbsp;simultaneously fascinating and infuriating to realize how many people view the site from aggregators (the former because the stats&nbsp;are cool and the latter because there are clearly a whole bunch of people who can't see the site from the aggregator and are not bothering to look further).</FONT></P><FONT face=Tahoma>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>None of the category RSS links seem to be affected.</FONT></P>
<P>But <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/">http://blogs.msdn.com/</A> has the same problem with its syndication link. And maybe some other people do, too. Perhaps this will be fixed soon....</P>
<P>You do not need to either send email or contact me via the site. :-)</FONT></P>

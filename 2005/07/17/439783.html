<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Last night was a night for dancing (well, that pseudo-dancing I do with the scooter) at Misty's in Bellevue, and since things do not get rolling there until after 9pm, dinner seemed like a good idea.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Of course, trying to get dinner reservations at 7:30pm on Saturday night is pretty difficult. But optimist that I am, I called the usual haunts right around there -- <A href="http://www.seastarrestaurant.com/">Seastar</A>, <A href="http://www.schwartzbros.com/pr_restaurants_daniels.cfm">Daniel's</A>, <A href="http://www.schwartzbros.com/pr_press_releases_detail.cfm?id=15&amp;loc=current">Spazzo</A>. The first was booked until 9:00 but they did offer a full menu in the bar and there were seats, so I put it down for a maybe. Daniel's was pretty much full for the evening. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And Spazzo? I </FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>honestly I had been less happy with them since they first changed their format from a Mediterranean Grill to an Italian restaurant. </FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>For years I had been going there with people, and I don't ever remember ordering off the regular menu -- we would just order different tapas for the meal. Since with the big change&nbsp;all of the cool tapas (including 'Electric Goat Cheese') were removed from the menu, and since there were already plenty of Italian restaurants out there, it just did not hold that much appeal....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But in a pinch I figured it was worth a try.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Unfortunately, as the Spazzo link above indicates, they&nbsp;shut down on May 27th. <FONT face=Tahoma>They lost their lease, it seems. The new owners of the Key Bank Building wanted the space for offices, according to Bill Schwartz. I guess I would have noticed sooner if I were not waiting to get over my bitterness thing about the format change.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Now that is the end of an era for me.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Spazzo was the first real restaurant in the area I went to in the period around the time I moved to Seattle -- the details are kind of&nbsp;fuzzy now but if memory serves, Lynn Caldwell (then Shanklin) had taken Dan Haught and I there when were in town for something or other like an MVP Summit or an Insiders meeting. That was way back in 1996 (just four years after their doors had opened), and the food was awesome. It was one of the only "view" restaurants in Bellevue. After I moved to the Seattle area I had been there many times, always ordering off the tapas menu. I had easily introduced a few dozen people to Spazzo over the years....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>That is kind of sad. Almost as sad as the fact it does not look like the Schwatrz Brothers have active plans to open up a Mediterranean Grill named Spazzo in a new location. :-(</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>On a more positive note, we ended up going to Seastar for dinner, which was excellent. And&nbsp;the dancing was cool and we probably stayed until after midnight (eventually the floor was too full and it seemed like it would be best to head out while we could). It looks like people are okay with the scooter thing and they even like it (we got several comments from people). <FONT face=Tahoma>I might have to rethink that whole thing about the scooters ("boy who scoots gets no beauts"). :-)</FONT></P>
<P>Of course I did not test out trying to ask other people to dance. There are definitely limits to what people might want to handle on a Saturday night!</FONT></P>

He said that there were rumors of opening a new Italian place somewhere but it probably wouldn't be named Spazzo and it almost definitely wouldn't be the tapas format.  Apparently even though the tapas were really popular it was to hard to keep the necessary inventory and quality control for 3 dozen or so different ones as well as the traditional menu.<br><br>We used to do the same thing - get a good crowd of people and everybody order 2-4 tapas for the table.  We were really disappointed when they changed format.</div>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It is Thursday night, I can hear the party from where I am sitting (in room 3c, while the party is down in 3a). I was actually there for a while. I was&nbsp;originally going to skip it but essentially&nbsp;ended up going with a woman named Pauline I met at a BoF this afternoon since she did not know where her friends were and did not want to just randomly go&nbsp;by herself. We hung out for a while but never found the karaoke bar. We did fine her friends and they all decided to play human Fooz-ball (a game that my team back home would probably love!) so I decided to look for a bathroom.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Anyway, on the way down the hall I noticed that my scooter charge was in the red -- almost empty. So I tucked in here to charge up a bit. Maybe I will head back to the party soon, for a bit. I'll blog more later and talk about the&nbsp;two cool sessions I saw and David V's keynote,&nbsp;which was also cool. And maybe a bedtime story or two.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I have that BoF tomorrow on keyboards -- I hope people show up but I am afraid they will all have partied too hard (I know the SQL Server party hurt the early sessions today, I would have probably been there last night if I had not gone to see Aimee Mann play at Paradiso instead).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Ok, I am going to head back to the party. More to come....</FONT></P>

Kaplan</strong> on 7 Jul 2005 7:01 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Hi Tom,<br><br>See <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/07/07/436643.html">http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/archive/2005/07/07/436643.aspx</a> for most of the setlist. I think the show was cool, and I got to meet Mark and Harriett and they had great advice on a thai food place where we all had dinner.<br><br>There was no Ray or Invisible Ink, but there was Wise Up and Save Me and KOTJ. So I did not feel cheated. :-)<br><br>She did not seem as comfortable with the between-song banter though --  maybe really tired from being in Germany the night before?</div>

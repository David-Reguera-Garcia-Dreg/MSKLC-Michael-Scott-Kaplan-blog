<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I read David Weinberger's <A href="http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/mtarchive/004138.html">post</A>&nbsp;about how even with an aggregator, there is just too much out there to keep up with all of it.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>As a public service to the blogosphere, I am going to volunteer my blog as one that you should not read. I will keep posting as some sort of catharsis on all of the weird and interesting international issues and bugs and features and tehnologies, as well as all that personal stuff which I am not too tempted to stop since more people seem interested in it. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Heck, the tagline says "<EM>random stuff of dubious value</EM>." Doesn't that say it all?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But I would strongly suggest not reading this blog if you are overloaded on blogs to read. I am really <STRONG>not</STRONG> that interesting. Ask anyone who knows me or has met me! :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Ok, with that out of the way you can really stop reading. I will ramble for a bit.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I guess I will <A href="http://www.marketingprofs.com/5/solomon4.asp">bore Susan Solomon with this blog</A>. Ok, she won't read it, either. Because I will talk about my cat (who is still doing okay, thanks to all of you who keep sending positive thoughts this way about her). And whatever other random stuff is happening.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Still here? hmm... must be a glutton for punishment!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Ok, let's try something technical....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I have had a few people email me and ask me why there are no international sessions listed for <A href="http://commnet.microsoftpdc.com/content/sessions.aspx">the upcoming PDC</A>. I'm not really on the PDC planning committee, so it is not up to me and I am really not sure. But this is not any kind of strategic message that globalization support is somehow less important.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I do know that in the USA most people only tend to consider international stuff to be important if they are required to (like the boss who wants Japanee support added THIS WEEK). Which is happening more and more every day, but that kind of motivator is not generally one that drives attendance to the PDC, which usually seems more about showcasing technologies that are coming so people can understand the landscape, and the important upcoming stuff.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>On top of that, everyone knows we will add locales. And fonts. And do things to make languages look better. So many of our features, even though they are compelling, are not <STRONG>news</STRONG> in the sense of stuff to showcase.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Of course that is not 100% true -- there <EM>are</EM> technologies that are being added to Longhorn, and we did a whole lot of work in Whidbey as well. So perhaps there will be a session or sessions added to cover some of the more compelling ones. It's not like the list is final or anything.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Personally, I would love to do a talk entitled "<EM>String.Compare is for sissies (and so is lstrcmp)</EM>" that would talk about all of the issues with doing string comparisons incorrectly, especially when going between technologies or platforms or file systems or authentication systems.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It is not <EM>exactly</EM> a security talk, but neither is the <STRONG>Turkic I</STRONG> issue, though people can hit it in the context of not being able to open a file with a certain name or similar unexpected behavior.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Ok, I know. That is stretching it. But it is still an important conversation. Maybe worth a BoF or a Chalk Talk.... :-)</FONT></P>

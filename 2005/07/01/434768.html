<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The discussion about window offices in <A href="https://blogs.msdn.com/mikhailarkhipov/archive/2005/06/29/434057.aspx">Mikhail Arkhipov's blog</A>&nbsp;(via <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jobsblog/archive/2005/07/01/434468.aspx">Gretchen</A>!) got me thinking about the one time I had a window office.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I had just gotten the contract to write the <A href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?kbid=149894">Internet Assistant for Access 95</A>, my first contract with the Access group. Now that I think about it, the contract was actually with David Lazar and the folks in DAD (Desktop Applications Division) Marketing. There was going to a cool "Publish to the Web" wizard in Access 97 but they wanted to get out a smaller version of it for Access 95. And I happened to be in town (doing a&nbsp;six month contract working for the Certification Systems folks), so they thought this would fill some time nicely....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Anyway, Access was in Building 1 back then (early 1997, I guess?) and there was just nothing available in the way of suitable offices. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I offered to just work from home but nobody had gotten me approved for RAS yet. Plus they just wanted to make sure I could meet with people and talk to them and such.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So they stuck me in a huge window office. No name tag on the door or anything, but it was a place to plug in the computers and get work done.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>No one seemed to mind that this was my office either. Which is odd if you think about how the rules about window offices are allocated (see Mikhail's post).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I was there for about three weeks. And then one day....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Someone put up a makeshift name sign that had my name and alias on it. Within half a day of that there were so many complaints about the vendor with the window office that Greta (the group's Admin) had me immediately moved into an office, I think it was the "Access Insider's" office (where they would have external customers who were visiting sit).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I have talked to several full-time MS employees about this a few times in the 7+ years&nbsp;since it happened, and almost without fail people understood why no one might mind with no sign on the door but might object strenuously once there was one -- even a makeshift one that was clearly not official. Now I have been a full time employee myself for almost three years and I still do not get it.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I am on a team with a lot of senior people right now, with probably so many people who will get windows first that I may never see Seattle clouds out the window.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But if no one had put up a sign I might have kept that office for the rest of that year.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Ah well, at least there are the memories of the window office I had for three weeks, once upon a time....</FONT></P>

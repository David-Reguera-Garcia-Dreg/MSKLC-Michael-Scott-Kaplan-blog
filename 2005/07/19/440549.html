<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Sometimes, you go to log in to your Windows box. You see this friendly dialog (all screen shots c/o Virtual PC):</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/logon2.jpg"></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>(adjust for your Windows version, of course!)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>You do the requested three-fingered salute, and type in your password:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/logon1.jpg"></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>and at this point is where I cringe. Because at least for 2-3 attempts, the next dialog I will see is:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/logon3.jpg"></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It is because my typing sucks. Not just for speed but for accuracy. And so for me (sitting in a private office where no one can read my screen) the only benefit to having astericks or black circles or whatever is that I just may screw up the password enough times that someone thinks I am a hacker trying to break in.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Now this is not just a Windows thing, every operating system does this. The belief that the password that I am typing and obviously must at least know what&nbsp;I am typing is more secure because it is obfuscated is everywhere.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But to be frank, from an accessiblity standpoint I would prefer that they just made the password visible in the dialog. That way I can see when I messed up and avoid worrying security people who probably have real issues to deal with.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Now I am sure there are worries about screen scraping programs and other such things, but something remembering my keystrokes seems oretty devastating too. But we think our way around those things usually. So why not make it an accessibility option to make the passwrd visible, for those people whose typing on a scale of 1 to lame has reached the point of lame?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Sorry for the rant, but it took me much longer to log on today then it ought to have....</FONT></P>

You can't type, so everybody else in the world must have their passwords shown in clear to every bod that happens to pass by.<br><br>I have worked on IT security, and campaigned to have individual responsibility, including post-it notes with passwords on and under PCs, to be culpable offences. You are giving the burglars the key to the front door. It's a simple as that.<br><br>Oh, Quis Custodiet Ipsos Custodes?</div>

I am just suggesting it could be an accessibility OPTION for those who needed it. Not that everyone would need it, or even want it. Geez. Though I suppose it is an honor to be the author of the most idiotic thing you have seen in 23 years. Do I get a trophy or something? :-)</div>

But sometimes, its necessary. An option, and the ability to turn it on/off at the corporate level surely wouldn't hurt anyone, it would only help.<br><br>And for the record, if you think that that he is alone in this problem, you need to open your eyes a bit wider...</div>

On the con side, if THIS POST is the  most idiotic thing in 23 years, then this would suggest a somewhat sheltered view of security (especially since the feature itself has less to do with security in many places it is applied!).</div>

Though if you have something running as a system service on people's machines then you already own the box and you could get either feature off the shelf from various hacking sites. Few people write new stuff for this kind of thing, these days....</div>

After one frustrating year in which we all got knocked off because after 3 wrong tries access was permantently denied until our tech support fixed it, which was never... all teachers have the password &quot;teacher&quot; and all students &quot;student&quot;. So far, one year later, no one has &quot;hacked&quot; anything. So, really, that makes you one step up from the most idiotic. I claim that for our security system. <br><br>Suz</div>

Fairly sure this counts as a bug.</div>

But to see the text on your screen is much easier: from across the room, binoculars through the window, archival security tapes, TEMPEST receivers, etc.<br><br>What you WANT is to have a local echo of your keyboard, right? How about if there was a little LCD display at the top of your keyboard that echoed the last 15 keystrokes? It seems like someone could fab that up.<br><br>-Wayne Steele<br></div>

Someone passing by could observe you entering your password.<br><br>Sure, they could observe it just as well by watching your fingers, but that's harder.<br><br>Suppose your computer has VNC installed, or there's a remote desktop connection initiated, or some other such remote viewing.<br><br>Suppose the computer is a conference room machine, and the monitor is projected onto a large projection screen in front of hundreds of people.</div>

<p><a id="440670" href="#440670">#</a> <strong>Dean Harding</strong> on Tuesday, July 19, 2005 8:15 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">&gt; I have worked on IT security, and campaigned to have individual responsibility,<br>&gt; including post-it notes with passwords on and under PCs, to be culpable offences.<br><br>All that encourages people to do is to use more &quot;easy to remember&quot; (read: easy to guess, easy to dictionary attack) password.  I think having a good strong password, *and keeping it written down in your wallet* is a good idea.<br><br>Even Bruce Schneier agrees: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/06/write_down_your.html">http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/06/write_down_your.html</a><br><br>As for displaying it on screen, I wouldn't imagine there'd be any real problem.  The chance of people stealing your password by watching you type it in is rather slim.  Much simpler to install a tiny hardware key logger between the keyboard and the PC.  They don't need to install any software, they don't need to be there when you type it in.  You've just got to leave your PC unattended for 2 minutes.</div>

They are generated based on your ID file (and hence are unique to you), and will always be the same for any particular sequence of characters that you enter. This gives you a visual cue as to whether you've typed your password correctly or not, without revealing anything to someone who is looking over your shoulder (or whatever).<br><br>-Kevin Owen</div>

However, the solutions are not always obvious. <br><br>For blind users, we are evaluating token calculators the size of desk blotters which read aloud the text on the LCD and have braille markings on the keys. The LCD screen itself is approximately 10 cm high, so hopefully those with partial site can read them. <br><br>Security folks often forget the accessibility aspects of their designs. the people who came up with CAPTCHAs are first against the wall in my book. <br><br>Here's a paper I found yesterday (from 1999) which proves that most security policies that implement tough passwords are stupid and counterproductive:<br><br><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.ftp.cl.cam.ac.uk/ftp/users/rja14/tr500.pdf">http://www.ftp.cl.cam.ac.uk/ftp/users/rja14/tr500.pdf</a><br><br>Couple with Bruce's comments above (which I read yesterday and agree with), honestly, the vast majority of password policies produce insecurity.<br><br>The OWASP Guide 2.0 (the webappsec standard I write and am releasing at Black Hat next week will contain some of these details). <br><br>In my view, if you consider accessibility in your security solution design, it generally produces a far more robust outcome. <br><br>Andrew</div>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma><A href="http://www.corante.com/goingglobal/">John Yunker</A>&nbsp;posted an ironic little ditty a few days ago entitled <A href="http://www.corante.com/goingglobal/archives/2005/07/13/pardon_my_french.php">Pardon My French</A>. The post's scariest note said:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><EM><FONT size=2>A group of French language teachers in Japan are suing the mayor of Tokyo for saying, "French is a failed international language because it cannot be used to count numbers."</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Honestly, I believe it. Though most people consider the seemigly obsessive interest and multitude of methods of counting in Japanese to be one of the hardest "gratuitous features" of the language!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Though like I said when I asked <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2004/12/25/332259.html">What the %$#! are genitive dates?</A>, every language seems to have those items that make it easier to learn/use, and items that make it harder. Judging a language as a failure because of this is kind of missing the point.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Would I sue the mayor? Probably not. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But would I blog about the ignorance displayed? I'll answer that question with a question -- do you really have to ask? :-)</FONT></P>

If he was ignorantly insulting French numbers, might as well go the full monty and bring that up too.</div>
<p><a id="439896" href="#439896">#</a> <strong>Richard</strong> on 18 Jul 2005 5:42 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Apparently the complexity of the French numbering system (no 80, its 4x20) does impact learning.<br><br>(No URL to hand, but last episode of &quot;More or Less&quot;, on BBC Radio 4, which should still be available on listen again on www.bbc.co.uk/radio4.)<br><br>They didn't, unfortunately, answer the obvious question of FR variants (e.g. fr-CH) which do have a word for 80.</div>

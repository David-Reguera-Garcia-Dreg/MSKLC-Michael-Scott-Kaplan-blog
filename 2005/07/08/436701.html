<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The Michael referred to in the title is actually Michael Penn, not I. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It started several years ago when singer/songwriter Michael Penn wrote and performed a song entitled <STRONG>No Myth</STRONG>. The lyrics for this song as published (on several fan and official lyrics sites) are as follows:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2><EM>So, she says it's time she goes<BR>but wanted to be sure I know<BR>she hopes we can be friends.<BR>I think, yeah, I guess we can say I<BR>but didn't think to ask her why<BR>she blocked her eyes and drew the curtains<BR>with knots I've got yet to untie.<BR>what if I was Romeo in black jeans<BR>what if I was Heathcliff, it's no myth <BR>maybe she's just looking for<BR>someone to dance with.<BR>See, it was just too soon to tell<BR>and looking for some parallel<BR>can be an endless game.<BR>We said goodbye before hello<BR>my secrets she will never know<BR>and if I dig a hole to China<BR>I'll catch the first junk to Soho.<BR>what if I was Romeo in black jeans?<BR>what if I was Heathcliff, it's no myth.<BR>maybe she's just looking for<BR>someone to dance with.<BR>Sometime from now you'll bow to pressure.<BR>some things in life you cannot measure by degrees.<BR>I'm between the poles and the equator.<BR>don't send no private investigator to find me please<BR>'less he speaks Chinese <BR>and can dance like Astaire overseas.<BR>what if I was ...<BR>so what if I was... <BR>maybe she's just looking for<BR>someone to dance with.<BR>what if I was Romeo in black jeans?<BR>so what if I was Heathcliff, it's no myth.<BR>maybe she's just looking for<BR>someone to dance with.</EM></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I have heard Michael Penn perform this song a few times, most </FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>recently at the Tractor Tavern with Teresa and Kevin (Cathy's husband, who has better taste in music than she does at times like that!), and Michael actually talked about the fact the song was inspired was a breakup. Which seems fairly obvious from the lyrics. But he gave a hint of how bad the breakup was&nbsp;when he sang the song by replacing the last "<EM>someone to dance with</EM>"&nbsp;with "<EM>someone to f*** with</EM>". I wonder if this ex knows that in her games she managed to inspire what has been the song most often associated with him? Quite ironic, that!&nbsp;:-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Back to linguistic matters now.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Some fan sites take the couplet under question here (we'll label the options in faux <A href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/">Language Log</A> fashion):</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><STRONG>1a</STRONG>:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>what if I <FONT color=#ff0000>was</FONT> Romeo in black jeans<BR>what if I <FONT color=#ff0000>was</FONT> Heathcliff, it's no myth </FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>and instead quote it this way:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><STRONG>1b</STRONG>:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>what if I <FONT color=#ff0000>were</FONT> Romeo in black jeans<BR>what if I&nbsp;<FONT color=#ff0000>was</FONT> Heathcliff, it's no myth </FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>while still others quote it this way:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><STRONG>1c</STRONG>:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>what if I <FONT color=#ff0000>were</FONT> Romeo in black jeans<BR>what if I&nbsp;<FONT color=#ff0000>were</FONT>&nbsp;Heathcliff, it's no myth </FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Anyway, every time I have heard Michael Penn perform this song solo (I think maybe five times to date), he sang it like <STRONG>1a</STRONG>. And I once heard a report of Aimee Mann and Michael singing the song together at an <A href="http://web.archive.org/web/20020926143948/http://www.acousticvaudeville.com/">Acoustic Vaudeville</A><SUP><FONT size=1>1</FONT></SUP> show where Aimee sang with <STRONG>1c</STRONG> while Michael sang with <STRONG>1a</STRONG>, and this apparently had the tongue waggers putting in overtime about some sort of implied insult to Michael's artistic choices (which seems silly to me, for what it is worth). I saw them both once at an Acoustic Vaudeville show myself not too long after that and they both sang with <STRONG>1a</STRONG>. I have heard a recording of the 02-13-2000 A.V. show where they both used <STRONG>1a</STRONG>. As perhaps an official authority, it is further confused by the original No Myth track on <A href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000008JCW/"><STRONG>March</STRONG></A>&nbsp;and <STRONG><A href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005RDCF">March w/Bonus Tracks</A></STRONG>, both of which clearly have Michael&nbsp;using</FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>&nbsp;<STRONG>1b</STRONG> for the first two instances and <STRONG>1a</STRONG> for the last two. Though I have never heard either of then do it that way live, maybe the folks who were assuming a lover's quarrel over the lyrics were just hearing what they wanted to, and in fact DID hear such a version.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Now to anyone with any even high school level literary background,&nbsp;the two character references are to Romeo of Shakespeare's <STRONG>Romeo and Juliet</STRONG> and Heathcliff of Emily Bronte's <STRONG>Wuthering Heights</STRONG>.<SUP><FONT size=1>2</FONT></SUP></FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>&nbsp;And there are probably fewer more beautifully tragic (or maybe tragically beautiful?) love stories than those of Romeo Montague/Juliet Capulet and Heathcliff/Catherine Earnshaw (though the latter seems more tragic in some ways since it was unconsummated, while we assume that since former young couple at least had that one night before the exile to Mantua<SUP><FONT size=1>3</FONT></SUP>.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Now the difference between <STRONG>was</STRONG> and <STRONG>were</STRONG> is not just an artistic one. If you look at the dictionary:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><EM><STRONG>was</STRONG> -- First and third person singular past indicative of be.</EM></FONT></P>
<P><EM><FONT face=Tahoma><STRONG>were</STRONG> -- (1) Second person singular and plural and first and third person plural past indicative of be.&nbsp;(2) Past subjunctive of be.</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Since we know that the song is referring to 'I' we know it is neither second person singular nor first/third person plural. Thus the only differences for us to deal with are:</FONT></P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>The latter is the past subjunctive case, while the former is simply the past indicative</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>There is a&nbsp;known phenomenon going on with the use of were here, description quoted in the&nbsp;<EM><A href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=were">were</A></EM> definition at <A href="http://dictionary.reference.com/">dictionary.com</A>:<BR><BR></FONT><FONT face="Times New Roman">Although many irregular verbs in English once had different singular and plural forms in the past tense, only one still does today - <I>be,</I> which uses the form <I>was</I> with singular subjects and the form <I>were</I> with plural subjects, as well as with singular <I>you.</I> The relative simplicity in the forms of most verbs reflects the long-standing tendency of English speakers to make irregular verbs more regular by reducing the number of forms used with different persons, numbers, and tenses. Since past <I>be</I> is so irregular, speakers of different vernacular dialects have regularized it in several ways. In the United States, most vernacular speakers regularize past <I>be</I> by using <I>was</I> with all subjects, whether singular or plural. This pattern is most common in Southern-based dialects, particularly African American Vernacular English (AAVE). Some speakers use <I>were</I> with both singular and plural subjects; thus, one may hear <I>she were</I> alongside <I>we were.</I> However, this usage has been much less widespread than the use of <I>was</I> with plural subjects and appears to be fading. · In some scattered regions in the South, particularly in coastal areas of North Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland, vernacular speakers may regularize past <I>be</I> as <I>was</I> in positive contexts and regularize it as <I>weren't</I> in negative contexts, as in <CITE>He was a good man, weren't he?</CITE> or <CITE>They sure was nice people, weren't they?</CITE> At first glance, the <I>was/weren't</I> pattern appears to come from England, where it is fairly commonplace. However, in-depth study of the <I>was/weren't</I> pattern in coastal North Carolina indicates that it may have developed independently, for it is found to a greater extent in the speech of younger speakers than in that of older coastal residents. ·Other forms of negative past <I>be</I> include <I>warn't,</I> common in American folk speech in the 18th and 19th centuries, and <I>wont,</I> as in <CITE>It wont me</CITE> or <CITE>They wont home.</CITE> <I>Wont,</I> which often sounds just like the contraction <I>won't,</I> historically has been concentrated in New England and is also found in scattered areas of the South.</FONT></LI></UL>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I think we may be able to set aside that second issue given the strong literary background Michael has and deal with the first one.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>That dictionary site helps us with the definitions of these terms, and the definitions match my not entirely forgotten notions of grammar:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><EM><STRONG>indicative</STRONG> -- Of, relating to, or being the mood of the verb used in ordinary objective statements. </EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><EM><STRONG>subjunctive</STRONG> -- Of, relating to, or being a mood of a verb used in some languages for contingent or hypothetical action, action viewed subjectively, or grammatically subordinate statements.</EM></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><EM><FONT size=2>Of course, the <STRONG>actual</STRONG> linguists over on the Language Log might need to correct my 'armchair linguist' definitions if they were to notice them. In fact, </FONT></EM><A href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001148.html"><EM><FONT size=2>Mark Liberman</FONT></EM></A><EM><FONT size=2>,&nbsp;Geoff Pullum, and&nbsp;</FONT></EM><A href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001192.html"><EM><FONT size=2>Arnold Zwicky</FONT></EM></A><EM><FONT size=2>&nbsp;have perhaps already been doing so, before I even stumbled onto the scene. I'll pretend I did not know about this for the rest of the post so&nbsp;I can at least empty the cache on the whole issue. :-)</FONT></EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Now when one is comparing one's bitter breakup to a tragic couple in literature (while pointing put that in this case it is not, in fact, a myth -- it is real life, dammit!), one is certainly speaking more hypothetically or subjectively. Comparing oneself to fictional characters in a real and painful situation suggests this, doesn't it?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I suppose one could make the claim that Michael is inventing new characters (Romeo obviously never wore black jeans, and Heathcliff was indeed part of a 'myth' or story), and in a song it could just be shorthand for saying "what if I was to you&nbsp;like&nbsp;Romeo while I wore my black jeans on the terrace -- would you still have left?" or alternately "what if was to you like the mythical Heathcliff, come to life and to love -- would you still have dumped me?"</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Which&nbsp;perhaps makes <STRONG>was</STRONG> more palatable since it is more literally talking about the past, <EM>Michael's past</EM>, when he did wear the darn jeans, and while still hypothetical, it is being couched in a way to suggest he was asking as if it were not so hypothetical to him (or maybe he just did not want it to be, as might be common in such a 'trying to talk the jumper off the breakup ledge' scenario).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Though the bitter version he sang at that recent Tractor Tavern show makes me wonder how real he thought the options actually would have been; even if they seemed real at the time, they obviously seem theoretical now. And if cynicism can see <EM>dance</EM> transformed into <EM>f***</EM> then certainly <EM>was</EM> can find itself transformed into <EM>were</EM>. And in truth the <EM>were</EM> feels more natural to me, anyway. 'Were I from North Carolina I might feel differently (though had that been in my vernacular, I would have said 'Was I from North Carolina', I guess. Maybe I am just blathering, now.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Maybe the best choice is actually the original on the <STRONG>March</STRONG> album -- doesn't a man in the middle of a breakup start with the theoretical past tense? And then, once that is clearly failing, try to move to the real past tense? Not only that, but he actually is saying it's no myth when he talks about Heathcliff -- which is pretty much stating the less than theoretical nature of the issue. I guess you could say Michael had it right the first time, in that case. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Personally I think Michael should stick with Aimee. She seems to be a better choice emotionally than this ex-girlfriend of his, and they both do seem to be quite taken with each other. And that is no myth whatsoever.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=1><EM>1 - Yes, this link is to the Internet Archive site, as Aimee and Michael seem to have let lapse their domain ownership, the last sad poof that they will likely never release the Acoustic Vaudeville album they were once thinking about doing at some point.<BR>2 - Although I have heard at least one person ask (after the song was performed) what a cartoon cat has to do with Shakespeare, and he seemed quite serious. No comment on this, other than to say it's like fingernails on the chalkboard to me.<BR>3&nbsp;- Could this be why the French word for orgasm (reportedly) means "little death"? Probably not, as I think that might be sleep anyway, and I do not want to start making bad etymological references. Forget I said a word....</EM></FONT></P>
<hr/><p><a id="436783" href="#436783">#</a> <strong>CornedBee</strong> on 8 Jul 2005 6:32 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">&gt; I suppose one could make the claim that Michael is inventing new characters (Romeo obviously never wore<br>&gt; black jeans, and Heathcliff was indeed part of a 'myth' or story), and in a song it could just be<br>&gt; shorthand for saying &quot;what if I was to you like Romeo while I wore my black jeans on the terrace -- would you<br>&gt; still have left?&quot; or alternately &quot;what if was to you like the mythical Heathcliff, come to life and to love<br>&gt; -- would you still have dumped me?&quot;<br><br>Actually, no, you can't make that claim.

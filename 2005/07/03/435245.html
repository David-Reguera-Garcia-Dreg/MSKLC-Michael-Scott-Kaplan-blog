<P dir=ltr><FONT face=Tahoma>And I will be around an about throughout the event....</FONT></P>
<P dir=ltr><FONT face=Tahoma>The screw-up that made a portion of the trip here stressful did not happen until the plane landed. I had some miles to burn so I had upgraded my ticket and it was a very comfortable flight. But once we were on the ground they did not bring the scooter up. The KLM folks were not being very helpful, either. I mostly kept my cool and I ran into Mike Hernandez who hung out and was also very supportive in this rough time. Turns out they sent it down to oversize baggage (despite the info where the delivery was to be planeside was clearly on the slip).</FONT></P>
<P dir=ltr><FONT face=Tahoma>But I am here now, and everything I need is here now, too -- and I am ready to talk to customers!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jobsblog/">Gretchen</A> posted on Monday about <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jobsblog/archive/2005/07/11/436936.aspx">how to work for Microsoft if you don't live in North America</A>. I think I may have linked to material on this before since I have gotten questions about the issues, and I do not know as much about this as I probably ought to know.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But since she has promised to try to do a good job on letting people know when there are offsite interviews being held in other countries, and I read her blog, I promise to point out when something like that comes up. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It may even be fun to try and be around in vacation at the same time, and maybe pop by and meet people! Or maybe that would be a little more pressure than a candidate needs that day....</FONT></P>

<h1>Why my syndication links were broken....</h1>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The other day I complained about how <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/07/27/444234.html">My syndication links are broken</A>.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>We can blame it all on surrogates! :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>You see, when&nbsp;I complained that <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/07/27/444101.html">There is no such thing as a surrogate character (dammit!)</A>, the post was sponsored by the first high surrogate, <A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/d800/index.htm">U+d800</A>. And I made the mistake of putting that lone surrogate in quotes as the sponsor.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Community Server was using XML functionality that assumed standards conformant text -- which of course unpaired surrogates are not. So it was choking on the invalid text.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Earlier, when I was saying that blogs.msdn.com was broken, too? Well, my post was in there too -&nbsp;until it scrolled off of the most recent 25. That is also why it came back up so quickly.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The moral of the story? Don't use unpaired surrogate code points. My site was down to RSS aggregators for days!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>(the Community Server folks will also try to handle this case a bit more gracefully in future versions, too!)</FONT></P>

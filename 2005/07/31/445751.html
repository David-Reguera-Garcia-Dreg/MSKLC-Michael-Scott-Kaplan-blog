<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Yes, I went to the company picnic yesterday, scooter and all....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It was an interesting time, though it does seem to be especially made for kids (and parents with kids). There were many events there that I was not going to try but Teresa thought she would give a shot. I even took some pictures for you to enjoy if you like <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/07/31/445750.html">that sort of thing</A>. I took some liberties with temporal issues for the sake of the narration, hopefully I can be forgiven that for the sake of the story....</FONT></P>

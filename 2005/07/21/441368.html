<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The title of this post is a question I asked a few months ago of Anna Tholse, one of the very cool developers on the NLS team, whose office is right next door to mine.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>(We were talking about the benefits of </FONT><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/07/01/434768.html"><FONT face=Tahoma>window offices</FONT></A><FONT face=Tahoma>, and the benefits of a place that sees more sun than Seattle.)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>She paused, thinking about it seriously, since it seemed like I was asking seriously.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Then she smiled like an angel and said "Yes!" </FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>:-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And in case there was fear of bias on Anna's part, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/">Raymond Chen</A> has <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/07/21/441331.aspx">pointed to a study</A> that proves it objectively. :-)</FONT></P>

It was not a smirk or a sarcastic look. She took my question seriously and answered it seriously, but with a smile (probably because she was thinking of those same sunny days that make people feel better according to that study!).<br></div>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I am also doing a BOF:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><STRONG>BOF018: Keyboards on Windows --&nbsp;&nbsp;What Works, What Doesn't?</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>This will be taking place on Friday, July 8, 8:30 -- 9:45. So I will be fighting the natural tendency of people to be too hung over from the Thursday night party to attend a Friday morning session.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>My hopes for this Birds of a Feather session is a good dialog with people who&nbsp;are having either good luck or bad luck when it comes to keyboards. This is a chance to get answers to questions (and perhaps give them!), to hear some of the interesting stories behind a few of the keyboards, and to get your feedback and problems heard by the person responsible for the next version of MSKLC.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I will have some stuff to give away in a drawing type thing, for those who show up! :-)</FONT></P>

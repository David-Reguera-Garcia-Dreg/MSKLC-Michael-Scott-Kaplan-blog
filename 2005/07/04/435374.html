<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I was talking to an attendee of TechEd who had just registered. He was looking at all of the sessions that were available, and asked me what I was talking about in my sessions.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>When I told him, he thought for a moment and then asked me the question that is the title of this post --&nbsp;<STRONG>are your&nbsp;'International' topics sexy?</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Hmmm, never thought about it that way before. So I explained for a minute what I thought 'sexy' meant in this context....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Well, perhaps not as sexy as topics like <EM>SQL Server performance and how to maximize it</EM>. But then I'll be talking about that this week.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And maybe not as sexy as topics like <EM>SQL Server upgrade, migration, and/or conversion</EM>. But I'll be damned is&nbsp;those are&nbsp;not topics I'll be talking about, too!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Certainly not as sexy as topics like <EM>SQL Server Security</EM> that people like <A href="http://sqljunkies.com/WebLog/donkiely/">Don Kiely</A> cover in articles like <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/05/06/SQLServerSecurity/default.aspx"><STRONG>Keep Bad Guys at Bay with the Advanced Security Features in SQL Server 2005</STRONG></A> (great stuff, Don!). But after several requests from folks in TechEd Orlando I am going to be covering some interesting security issues that come up related to interntional issues in SQL, Windows, and mixed&nbsp;mode authentication scenarios.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And definitely not as sexy as topics like <EM>Yukon (SQL Server 2005) and its new features</EM>. But I even talk about&nbsp;some of those, too!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And that is before you get into all of the cool issues about language support and really using all that Win32, the .NET Framework, and SQL Server bring to the mix that is truly the <STRONG>most important topic for the world</STRONG>!!!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Seems pretty sexy to me, in a geeky technical sense at least.&nbsp;:-)</FONT></P>

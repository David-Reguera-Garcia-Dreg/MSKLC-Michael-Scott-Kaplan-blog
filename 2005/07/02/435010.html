Now that was nearly twenty years ago - I can barely believe that this company could be trading without such protection.<br><br>However it seems common for companies to make excuses about how difficult it is to establish such safeguards in their operating software ... even when it is clear that such issues have been dealt with successfully decades before. </div>

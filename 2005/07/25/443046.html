<h1>A subkultur iz a shprakh mit an armey un a flot</h1>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The title of this post is inspired by a quote from Max Weinrich, a Yiddish linguist -- <STRONG>A shprakh iz a dialekt mit an armey un a flot</STRONG>. I think it can be understood by many without knowledge of Yiddish, especially if they know German (as German-knowledgable Cathy likes to tell me, in a lot of ways Yiddish is like 16th century German with Hebrew letters). I knew what it meant but I don't know any German at all. Basically it can be translated as "A language is a dialect with an army and a navy."</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>He was speaking somewhat ironically when he said this, since obviously Yiddish has neither but nobody would presume to call it a dialect at this point.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But it does raise an interesting question about one of the difficulties of creating locales -- what would be the location of a Yiddish locale if one were to be added? There isn't one (though I think it might be fun to call it <STRONG>Yiddish - Shtetl</STRONG>, I doubt that would get past the lawyers!). And then of course we would need a <EM>Yiddish - Shtetl (Latin)</EM> and a <EM>Yiddish - Shtetl (Hebrew)</EM> to account for the fact that both scripts are used in these times. And the question of what to do wih collation is a fascinating one for the Latin script (though fairly obvious for the Hebrew script one).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Thus my modified quote, to cover the Windows requirement for&nbsp;cultures and locales as they are defined -- <STRONG>A subkultur iz a shprakh mit an armey un a flot</STRONG> (a culture is a language with an army and a navy). :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Or using the Hebrew script for the Yiddish phrase, something like:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT size=5>אײ סובקולטור איז אַ שפּראַך מיט אַן אַרמײ און אַ פֿלאָט</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The same problem exists for Esparanto, and really any language that crosses so many borders and lacks a specific origin location. It is just too hard to figure how they fit into the model of locales that Microsoft ships in Windows and the .NET Framework.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>This is one of the REAL benefits to both <EM>opening it all up</EM> and <EM>getting out of the way</EM>, since the difficulties that Microsoft would run into in trying to define a specific locale should not block an individual customer or even a community of customers from defining one that they would like to use.</FONT></P>

<p><strong>John Cowan</strong> on 10 Apr 2008 10:11 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>There are probably more Yiddish-speakers in Israel than in the U.S., though not by much.</p>
<p>BTW, what's with the אײ (alef tsvey-yudn) at the beginning of the sentence? &nbsp;It should be just אַ (alef-pasekh) -- at least in YIVO Standard Yiddish. &nbsp;AFAIK, Yiddish doesn't have the variation between [ə] and [ej] in its indefinite article that English has.</p></div>

<h1>MSLU isn't perfect</h1>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Now as far as I know, no one has ever stated a contrary opinion, but I thought I would point out that MSLU is not perfect.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>This does not of course keep people from being unhappy when they find a bug!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>One of the strangest patterns for a bug that I have ever seen (but which&nbsp;seems to be happening more&nbsp;frequently)&nbsp;is:</FONT></P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Developer relies on undocumented behavior of a message or function;</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>MSLU does not have this undocumented behavior in it;</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>At some later point, the documentation is updated so now the behavior <STRONG>is</STRONG> documented.</FONT></LI></UL>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Not sure what to do with this one, to tell you the truth.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>MSLU is in maintenance mode now, and of course a developer can always override any wrpped function if they do not like its behavior. So it would take a mondo serious bug which overrides would not help to cause there to be an update of the latest version. I am not saying that the bug repro scenario would have to claim that users were being physically harmed by unicows.dll, but it may need to be on the same order of magnitude. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Now I am all for documententation being made better whenever it can, but given where MSLU is right now, it is hard to take "smarter docs" as a criteria (since to date there is no report that smarter docs would actually harm anyone!).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Now it does make MSLU look a little bit worse, and people seldom have a good sense of history of what the docs used to say. It is&nbsp;truly one of those <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2004/11/28/271121.html">My dear boy...</A> type situations, but it is not to hard to believe that code that one wrote years ago is less smart than you thought it was. It is like when they did that thing with the SATs and people are suddenly dumber than when they took the test 20 years before....</FONT></P>

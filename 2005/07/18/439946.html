<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It was about two months ago when I pointed out a method for <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/05/18/419117.html">typing in random Unicode code points</A>&nbsp;using the Unicode IME.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Well, Andrew over at <A href="http://www.fileformat.info/">http://www.fileformat.info</A> (the cool provider of my Unicode character links!) has been getting feedback on this issue for a long time, such that his <A href="http://www.fileformat.info/tip/microsoft/enter_unicode.htm">How to enter Unicode characters into Microsoft Windows</A>&nbsp;page is by his own report the paage that recieves the most feedback.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Anyway, he wrote a small program that will make the entry easier -- the <A href="http://www.fileformat.info/tool/unicodeinput/index.htm">UnicodeInput Utility</A>.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Handier in a lot of ways than that IME and with an easy mechanism for launch, it is a good solution for a generic answer to the quewtion of how to enter potentially random code points. Check it out! :-)</FONT></P>

<p><a id="440407" href="#440407">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 19 Jul 2005 10:04 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">I am an open-minded kind of guy. It is nice to know that people find the things that I say to be relevant whether they are running Windows or not....<br><br>Plus the fact that what the ISP uses to host your site has little to do with what someone runs on their own machines. :-)</div>
<p><a id="440414" href="#440414">#</a> <strong>Ben Bryant</strong> on 19 Jul 2005 10:25 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Just press Alt-GreyPlus, type your hex code point and it sends your character to whatever was active, very cool.<br>Michael, I'd like to point you to my free editor which allows you to type in any code point and convert it to the relevant character (&quot;Convert Char Ref&quot;), it also lets you right click on a character to see the code point and Unicode range (&quot;Char Unicode&quot;), and if you select an ANSI encoding via Tools Encoding menu (it sets an XML Declaration, but your document doesn't have to be XML) it will show you the corresponding ANSI hex byte encoding too. Unicode can be copied and pasted into and out of this editor all the way back to Win 95. It is not full featured, but anyway it is at firstobject.com/dn_editor.htm any comments welcome.</div>
<p><a id="440721" href="#440721">#</a> <strong>Andrew</strong> on 19 Jul 2005 10:54 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Of course, the first feedback I got on UnicodeInput was how to enter characters greater than U+FFFF.<br><br>All I'm doing is calling SendInput with wScan set to the codepoint.  How should I do it for codepoints greater than 0xFFFF?</div>
<p><a id="440730" href="#440730">#</a> <strong>Andrew</strong> on 19 Jul 2005 11:02 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">&gt; and it runs such an uncool os ;-)<br>Heh.  Like most of the world, I run multiple OS's.  While the main server is (correctly) identified as Linux, it is a pretty safe bet that the dotNet-specific information for each Unicode character isn't coming from there.</div>
<p><a id="440748" href="#440748">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 19 Jul 2005 11:32 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Hi Andrew!<br><br>Two options:<br><br>1) You can take the high surrogate followed by the low surrogate -- this probably works now.<br><br>2) You can take a UTF-32 code point and convert it to UTF-16 and then do two records in a SendInput call.<br><br>Obviously #2 is cooler than #1. :-)</div>
<p><a id="440867" href="#440867">#</a> <strong>Simon</strong> on 20 Jul 2005 6:03 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">I was the guy who asked Andrew about characters above U+FFFF. Will the application receive two keyboard events in both your options? I've found while experimenting with surrogate pairs in MSKLC that having one character split between two events can be a problem in some situations.<br><br>That might be a good interview question, no? What problems might that cause and how would you solve them?</div>
<p><a id="440921" href="#440921">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 20 Jul 2005 10:05 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Well, it is not like a keyboard can redo the way that Windows thinks about events, right? :-)<br><br>I have seen keyboards created for Old Italic, Deseret, and many other scripts where surrogate pairs were done in MSKLC, and never had problems rported with them, though. What kind of problems are you referring to, Simon?</div>
<p><a id="440932" href="#440932">#</a> <strong>Simon</strong> on 20 Jul 2005 10:35 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">I was thinking of situations like incremental search where the first event could result in trying to process a buffer ending with a high surrogate pair, or forms with auto-tabbing where you could end up with the surrogate pair split between two entry fields.<br></div>
<p><a id="440937" href="#440937">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 20 Jul 2005 10:51 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Well, that would be an application bug, one that would also fail for composite characters in languages. But in neither the case you bring up nor the composite one would be it be a keyboard bug....</div>
<p><a id="440942" href="#440942">#</a> <strong>Simon</strong> on 20 Jul 2005 10:58 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Did I say it would be a keyboard bug? Application bugs are where I am coming from here, and finding them is what I intend to use Andrew's excellent utility for.</div>
<p><a id="440962" href="#440962">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 20 Jul 2005 12:16 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Fair enough, Simon. :-)</div>

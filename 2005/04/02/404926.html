<P>Back in March, Mark Lieberman made a&nbsp;<A href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001963.html">suggestion</A>:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr>
<P><FONT size=2>We need a new term. <EM>Prescriptive grammar </EM>says "thou shalt not say (things that meet conditions) XYZ". <EM>Descriptive grammar</EM> says "love the vernacular, and say what you like". But what do we call it when you're taken grammatically aback by something you hear or read, and then try to figure out what the problem was? </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>This process is somewhat prescriptive, in that it starts with a perceived violation of internalized norms (what Geoff Pullum and Barbara Scholz call </FONT><A href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001843.html"><EM><FONT size=2>correctness conditions</FONT></EM></A><FONT size=2>). But it's also rather descriptive, in that you try to understand the problem by means of a systematic investigation of relevant patterns of usage. So how about <EM>reactive grammar</EM>? Or more informally, <EM>WTF grammar</EM>?</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Especially when I think about how often I get into conversations at work about whether people are being prescriptive or descriptive when they start correcting others, this category appeals&nbsp;to me a lot.</P>
<P>These are not like garden path sentences, since <EM>those</EM> actually are gramatically correct; they just lead you in a direction that is not actual place that the sentence is going. A good example? Something like "<EM>I convinced her children are noisy.</EM>" These are ones that you can't even back up and fix in your mind, and you may indeed be saying WTF when you try to answer the question of whether some type of grammar is being followed.</P>
<P>Some of the sentences that eventually inspired the term:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr>
<P><EM>(The one I stole from Eric Bakovic <A href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001962.html">here</A> for the title of this post!)</EM></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000>If you have an older Mac and upgraded the processor, don't expect it to work or support from Apple <EM>(from the same place). </EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000>Here, at last, was a word for the rug that quietly curls up so it can snag your toe, the sock gone AWOL from the dryer, the slippery piece of toast that always hits the floor jelly side down. <EM>(from Mark's article). </EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000>This is the car that's always been DIFFERENT and for 1968 it's differenter! <EM>(also from Mark's article)</EM>&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P>I nodded so hard I'm surprised my neck didn't snap and my head fall to the floor. <EM>(from </EM><A href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001977.html"><EM>More WTF coordinations</EM></A><EM>)</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This type of thing really does fascinate me, for reasons I cannot easily explain.&nbsp;I don't think it is a&nbsp;WTF concept issue, I'm just still figuring out where these "delusions of linguistic aptitude" are going to lead me....</P>

And now we have a habit of placing &quot;and salivates&quot; at the end of sentences just to be funny.</div>

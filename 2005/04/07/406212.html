<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Back in February, when I first <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/02/25/380314.html">posted</A> about&nbsp;how I might be at TechEd 2005 in Orlando, Peter Ibbotson <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/02/25/380314.html#380379">asked</A>:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2><EM>Any chance of pre-conference review copies? <BR></EM></FONT><FONT face=Tahoma size=2><EM>We would honestly devour and critique just this subject at the moment, as we haven't yet shipped anything for SQL2005 and it is our target database for the next version and right now change is easy. <BR>This reminds me we must submit our binary collation sequence bug (minor difference between 2K &amp; 2K5) <BR>Failing that fancy doing TechEd Amsterdam?</EM></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Well, turns out I will be in Amsterdam for TechEd Europe, too. I'll be doing at least those two talks and perhaps another (more on that, later).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So, I hope to see you there, Peter. And anyone else who will be there, of course. Be sure to come up and introduce yourself, and mention that you are one of those who tolerates my blatherings here!</FONT></P>

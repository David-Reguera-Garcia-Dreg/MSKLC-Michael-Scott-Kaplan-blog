<h1>TechEd Bloggers does not work for this site?</h1>

<P>Not sure why it is, but for some reason the <A href="http://techedbloggers.net/">Tech·Ed Bloggers</A>&nbsp;site does not seem to pick up posts I do here, even if they have Tech·Ed or TechEd in the title or included in the body of the post. </P>
<P>I am registered there as is my RSS feed, as you can see <A href="http://techedbloggers.net/Directory/Bloggers/Michael_Kaplan.category">here</A>&nbsp;but nothing I have posted about TechEd shows up.</P>
<P>Which is why my post <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/03/31/404371.html">Session info available on the TechEd site! (June 5-10)</A>&nbsp;never showed up there.</P>
<P>Weird.</P>
<P>Oh well, I am still going to be there, even if <A href="http://techedbloggers.net/">Tech·Ed Bloggers</A>&nbsp;does not&nbsp;pick it up....&nbsp;</P>
<P>After a huge recent stir here, I was&nbsp;even going to do a <A href="http://www.msteched.com/cfp/bofcallforpapers.aspx">Birds of a Feather</A>&nbsp;proposal about security and collation (or the evil that developers do with invariant comparisons), but I am not sure if that is something that speakers (or MS employees for that matter) are supposed to do. Plus I have a hard time knowing how interested people are in a topic like that.</P>
<P>I'll blog about it a bit, at least. I have a little already. </P>
<P>I'll give you a hint. Take the content of the following posts:</P>
<P><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2004/12/08/278170.html">Where is the locale? "Its Invariant." In <I>where</I>?</A><BR><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2004/12/29/344136.html">Comparison confusion: INVARIANT vs. ORDINAL</A><BR><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/01/18/355210.html">The jury will give this string no weight</A></P>
<P>and then use your imagination. :-)</P>

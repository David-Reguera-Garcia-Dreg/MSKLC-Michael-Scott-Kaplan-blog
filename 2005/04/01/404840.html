<h1>Problems with CDO and UTF-7....</h1>

<P>As long as I am linking the hell out of things this evening....</P>
<P><A href="http://www.codeka.com/blogs/index.php/dean">Dean Harding</A>&nbsp;(a faithful reader and commenter of this blog), pointed out a problem with <A href="http://www.codeka.com/blogs/index.php/dean/2005/03/31/cdo_and_utf_7"><FONT color=#0002ca>CDO and UTF-7</FONT></A>&nbsp;that has me wondering what the heck they are doing, too. He does post how he was able to work around it, in any case.</P>
<P>As he says: "I was having problems when trying to load an email message that contained body-parts encoded with the "unicode-1-1-utf-7" encoding. This encoding seems to be most popular with DSN (delivery status notification) messages, but theoretically any mail client should be able to encode with that encoding."</P>
<P>Thought I'd link to it for anyone who was interested....</P>
<P>And next time I decide to do this I will try combining several links into one post. Don't let the number of posts fool you, I am still feeling my way around this whole blogging thing. :-)</P>

CDO has to tell the ADO stream when it's dealing with Unicode content. CDO recognizes &quot;utf-7&quot; but not &gt;&gt;unicode-1-1-utf-7&lt;&lt;&quot;.</div>

An interesting encoding to say the least (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1642.html">http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1642.html</a>). I could see why the lack of unicode-1-1-utf-7 in CDO could cause a problem when treated as UTF-7, though I must say I fail to understand the motivation for the encoding itself.</div>

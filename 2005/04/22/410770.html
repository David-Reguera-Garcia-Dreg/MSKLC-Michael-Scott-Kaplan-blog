<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Well, there was some sort of accident on Harper that made me a little late, but nobody was too upset. And the projector was completely unwilling to work with my laptop, but we copied the slides onto Bob's laptop so I was able to get it all done.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But everything else at <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/04/20/410021.html">last night's talk</A> went really well. I love presenting for smart crowds, they have good ideas and good questions.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I was struck by the interest in understanding the basic features of CLR integration in Yukon, and I'll bet some people in the meeting will be downloading the CTP to give it a whirl. My biggest worry remains wondering how many fuddy-duddy sysadmins will not be willing to enable the CLR features in Yukon. But maybe people will be able to convince them that it is okay....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I also realized one really interesting factoid -- almost every single "undone" international item on my list of issues in SQL Server 2000 has beeen addressed in SQL Server 2005. How cool is that?!?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I'll post that list another time, as we get a bit closer to the Orlando Tech Ed.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Ok everyone, be sure to come by the <A href="http://www.clevelanddotnet.info/"><FONT face=Tahoma color=#0000ff>Microsoft C#/VB.NET SIG</FONT></A><FONT face=Tahoma>&nbsp;on Monday night (April 25th) at 6:30pm. It will be a blast!</FONT></FONT></P>

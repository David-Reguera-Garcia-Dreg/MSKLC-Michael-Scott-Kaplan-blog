<P><A href="http://blogs.technet.com/efleis"><FONT face=Tahoma>Eric Fleishman</FONT></A><FONT face=Tahoma>&nbsp;posted earlier about the fact that <A href="http://blogs.technet.com/efleis/archive/2005/04/17/403810.aspx">sometimes, blogging really is that hard</A>&nbsp;in a hilarious sendup of Brett Shirley's indecisive plunge into the blogosphere.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I am&nbsp;glad I had not just sipped any Limonata, because if I had it would be all over the keyboard. Eric's post was freaking hilarious.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Brett is someone I met last year when Cathy and I were meeting with Andrew Goodsell to talk about NLS, Active Directory, and Longhorn. </P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Andy invited Brett to come by too. H</FONT>e struck me as incredibly knowledgable and I immediately took to him since he was the first person at Microsoft outside of the Access world who was not afraid of saying that three letter word that starts with "J" without immediately spouting out some kind of curse word. The way most people around here seem to enjoy doing. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I definitely think that he should start posting in his <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/brettsh">blog</A>. As soon as he has a single post I will add him to my list of <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2004/12/18/325156.html">blogs I read</A>.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>C'mon Brett!</FONT></P>

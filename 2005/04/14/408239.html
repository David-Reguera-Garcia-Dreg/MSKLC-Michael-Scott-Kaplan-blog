<P><FONT face=Tahoma>My friend Cathy politely asked me the other day why no one was making comments on my blog anymore.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Since I had been accepting comments daily, I respectfully pointed out that they were not actually paying attention -- there were comments aplenty!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>She respectfully pointed out that my blog's home page had plenty of <STRONG>[0] comments</STRONG> notations on it. And I'll be damned if she wasn't right!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I did at that point respectfully point out if she clicked on the links (which was likely possible for her) then&nbsp;she would see the comments.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>She politely suggested what I could do at that point....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><EM>Anyone who knew me or more to the point her would know that my use of the words "politely" or&nbsp;"respectfully" above is utter crap -- we have a vigorously dynamic sort of relaionship! :-)</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Anyway, be sure to ignore the </FONT></P>

For instance, in Messenger, I get varying reports that my IM name has ??? or sometimes squares. Then, sometimes, I'm told they can see the hanja when I type a message, but not in other places in MSN Messenger. Is there a guide to figure out how to fix this?</div>

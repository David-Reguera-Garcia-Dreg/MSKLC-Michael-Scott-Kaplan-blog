<h1>And then there is the virama....</h1>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The Virama is a fascinating sign. It has a simple job -- it surpresses the inherent vowel that the preceding Indic letter contains.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I was very pleased once I understood this concept (I was&nbsp;dealing with Tamil at the time). And the collation rules also seemed quite intuitive to me -- a letter with its inherent vowel surpressed comes before that same letter that still has the vowel. It seemed intuitive because if the vowel was surpressed then it would "weigh less" than if it was not, right?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And I went out in the world with an understanding that I thought would spread to a dozen other scripts that had Viramas in them.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>If you know the actual truth you probably have some insight into why I consider my notions of having lingistic aptitude to be delusions....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face=Tahoma>Like I said, in the Tamil script, it is <A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0bcd/index.htm">U+0bcd</A>, and it is known as the Pulli. </FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face=Tahoma>And <FONT size=6>க்</FONT> (<A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0b95/index.htm">U+0b95</A> <A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0bcd/index.htm">U+0bcd</A>, Tamil Ka + Pulli) sorts before <FONT size=6>க</FONT> (<A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0b95/index.htm">U+0b95</A>, Tamil Ka) alone, in the Tamil language.</P>
<P>But on the other hand, in the Devanagrai script, it is <A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/094d/index.htm">U+094d</A>, it is known as the Halant. </P>
<P>And <FONT size=6>क्</FONT> (<A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0915/index.htm">U+0915</A> <A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/094d/index.htm">U+094d</A>, Devanagrai Ka + Virama) sorts after <FONT size=6>क</FONT> (<A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0915/index.htm">U+0915</A>, Devangari Ka) alone, in the Hindi language.</P></FONT></FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Ah, but in&nbsp;the Bengali script my insight worked again! It is <A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/09cd/index.htm">U+09cd</A>, and it is known as the Hasant. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And <FONT size=6>ক্</FONT> (<A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0995/index.htm">U+0995</A> <A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/09cd/index.htm">U+09cd</A>, Bengali Ka + Virama) sorts before <FONT size=6>ক</FONT> (<A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0995/index.htm">U+0995</A>, Bengali Ka) alone, in both the Bengali and Assamese languages.</FONT></P>
<P>But my hopes are dashed in the Malayalam script, where it is <A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0d4d/index.htm">U+0d4d</A>, and it is known as the Chandrakkala. </P>
<P>And <FONT size=6>ക്</FONT> (<A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0d15/index.htm">U+0d15</A>&nbsp;<A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0d4d/index.htm">U+0d4d</A>, Malayalam Ka + Chandrakkala) sorts after <FONT size=6>ക</FONT> (<A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0d15/index.htm">U+0d15</A>, Malayalam Ka) alone, in the Malayalam language.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And so on.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Any time I have talked to a native speaker of one of these languages, they have told me that the way that the language sorts simply feels natural to them. And I realize that the real problem was seeing what I thought was a technical reason for a set of principles that often do not have a logical reason that is so easily found.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It reminds me of&nbsp; section of that Douglas Adams book <U><STRONG>Mostly Harmless</STRONG></U>:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr>
<P><EM><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that astrology isn't a science," said Gail. "Of course it isn't. It's just an arbitrary set of rules like chess or tennis or -- what's that strange thing you British play?"<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Er, cricket? Self-loathing?"<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Parlimentary democracy. The rules just kind of got there. They don't make any kind of sense except in terms of themselves. But when you start to exercise those rules, all sorts of processes start to happen and you start to find out all sorts of stuff about people. in astrology the rules happen to be about stars and planets, but they could be about ducks and drakes for all the difference it would make. It's just a way of thinking about a problem that lets the shape of the problem begin to emerge. The more rules, the tinier the rules, the more arbitrary they are, the better. It's like throwing a handful of fine graphite dust on a piece of paper to see where the indentations are. It lets you see the words that were written on the paper above it that has now been taken away and hidden. It lets you see the words that were written on the piece of paper above it that's now been taken away and hidden. The graphite's not important. It's just the means of revealing their indentations. So you see, astrology's nothing&nbsp;to do with astronomy. It's just to do with people thinking about people.</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I think my attempt&nbsp;to find patterns in the chaos were an&nbsp;immature attempt to keep me from feeling foolish for being fascinated by a subject that is no more based on scientific principles than astrology is. But it is an interesting 'in" to learning about some aspects of language. Of which I have learned many.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>This site isn't about science. Its just to do with a wanna-be linguist thinking about language. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And sorting it all out....</FONT></P>

Often it doesn't even matter, as long as you are consistant.  For example, it doesn't matter what side of the road you drive on, as long as you are driving on the same side as everyone else.  The same applies to units of measure, traffic light colours, spelling, to name a few.</div>

I mean, why is &quot;A&quot; the first letter of our alphabet, and &quot;Z&quot; the last?</div>
<p><a id="406998" href="#406998">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on Sunday, April 10, 2005 10:03 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Exactly! I think it was a subconscious fear that I may be fascinated by something that therefore seemed to lack purpose that drove me to try to find meaning even when mening did not exist! :-)<br><br>I moved past that, though. Since I realized that there is still meaning and purpose in the functionality....</div>

<p><a id="407391" href="#407391">#</a> <strong>Ambarish Sridharanarayanan</strong> on Monday, April 11, 2005 7:25 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">I remember there being a controversy on the unicode lists with some people opining that consonants without the vowel sound, such as க் (U+0b95 U+0bcd) should have a single code-point, and that there should be vowel signs for 'A', similar to vowel signs corresponding to all other vowels. In other words, the controversy was whether the vowel 'A' was really inherent at all.<br><br>I think this relates to the &quot;naturalness&quot; of the sorting order - as a native Tamil speaker, I don't think the vowel is inherent at all; we're taught that the fundamental consonants are those with the Pulli (such as க்), and other consonants (such as க) are derived from these (by addition of vowels). I can understand that it's different in other Indic languages, but personally,  I think Unicode may have got it wrong (at least for languages like Tamil), in determining that letters with the vowel sound (such as க, U+0b95) are basic and those without, such as (க், U+0b95 U+0bcd) are derived.</div>
<p><a id="407433" href="#407433">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on Monday, April 11, 2005 10:08 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Ambarish -- indeed there was! Some of that was the firm belief that they are independent letter, other parts were the practical reason that people believed it was to great of a feat technologically to deal with them as composite characters made of multiple code points. <br><br>Luckily it was proven to the latter group of people that we were able to handle this issue from a technical standpoint....</div>
<p><a id="407436" href="#407436">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on Monday, April 11, 2005 10:20 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">To those in the first category, it is harder to give a satisfying answer, though it is fair to say that the cost of implementing support for all of the languages of India is made easier by using a generally consistent model across all of them than if each one had different models. And the ease of implementation has definitely worked to Tamil's favor, in this particular case, fwiw.</div>
<p><a id="407729" href="#407729">#</a> <strong>Ambarish Sridharanarayanan</strong> on Tuesday, April 12, 2005 6:22 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">@michkap: Thanks for your response.<br>To address your second point re. how a consistent model makes it more feasible for implementors, considering the market for Indic languages is quite immature - that's from the point of view of corporate entities and pragmatism. I continue to believe that when one is designing a universal (and hopefully permanent) standard, one should aim more towards correctness and completeness than pragmatism. I'm sure a lot of decisions re. Unicode and i18n in general would have been taken differently if standards organisations stuck to ease of adoption.</div>

There have been quite a few other websites using Unicode Tamil liberally, not to speak of Tamil bloggers. Infinitely better than dynamic fonts or the whole ISCII/TSCII/TAB/TAM mess.<br><br>BTW, in case it wasn't apparent, I couldn't agree with you more that Unicode is A Good Thing (TM) for Tamil, and thanks are due all companies including Microsoft for implementing and supporting languages where the revenue stream probably doesn't justify the decision. This topic has gotten old already, so ...<br><br>&lt;wistful&gt;... I just wish the Unicode consortium had addressed this subtle difference among the various Indic languages.&lt;/wistful&gt;</div>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Amazing. Last week they had weather that was sunny and in the 70s (some say 80s, a few days). </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Yet last night there was enough snow to topple trees down all over the area. In the case of the driveway in front of my parents' house, a huge branch from a neighbor's tree has literally blocked us in. Its too big to try and tow with a car and unless someone has a chainsaw or the fire department can come by, then we may be stuck here.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Yikes!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I thought I had gotten out of the trap that is Beachwood a few years shy of two decades ago. It is a bizarre twist on the notion of the whatever high atop the thing saying "Psyche!" to be trapped here again almost 18 years later.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Like an animal who will knaw off his own leg to get out of the trap, I try to use logic -- I could call a cab to get out!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But where would I go?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I know, I could call a cab to get out and then I could take it to a car rental agency to get a car!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Of course I can't really sleep in the car and I am not leaving until Tuesday.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Wait! I could just I could call a cab to get out and then I could take it to a car rental agency to get a car, get a hotel room.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But what about the Seder?</FONT></P><FONT face=Tahoma>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Aha! I could just I could call a cab to get out and then I could take it to a car rental agency to get a car, get a hotel room,&nbsp;</FONT>and then I can still go to Seder tonight, right?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Of course I would have to explain why my parents and grandmother were not there. Or actually, I wouldn't, since they have talked to my sister and brother-in-law on the phone and everyone knows why we might be trapped. They'll assume I just bailed when things got tough. Can't really go down that road and have a pleasant Seder at the same time, can I? :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Maybe I could call a cab, take it to a car rental agency to get a car, get a hotel room, swing by with the rental and pick everyone up and take them to the Seder. Then everyone gets to be happy.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Hmmm.... they would have to go down the steep driveway in the snow, which is not a picnic. And then go back up it, which is an anti-picnic to say the least.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Oh wait, I would have to do the same thing to go down the driveway. That would be even harder for me.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Damn, I guess I am not going anywhere.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Wait! The city has come by and dragged the tree into the yard (not the neighbor's yard, which fits in with my notion of there being no justice in the universe!).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Never mind, everyone. While I was sitting here whining the problem was solved on its own. I guess I have to try that more often!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I'll post this anyway, it is kind of funny how I managed to have a whole thing right here all on my own (and all for the price of two zuzim).</FONT></P>

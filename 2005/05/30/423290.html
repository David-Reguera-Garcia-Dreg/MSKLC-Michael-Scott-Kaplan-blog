<P><FONT face=Tahoma><A href="http://www.computerzen.com/">Scott Hanselman</A> posted about <A href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/TechEd2005WhatIsAGrokTalk.aspx">GrokTalk</A>, and explained what it is all about:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2><EM>The deal is this: We've all sat through some pretty lousy technical sessions at conferences. For the most part, sessions at TechEd are filled with good information, but every once in a while you sit through 75 minutes in order to "</EM></FONT><A href="http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/0,,sid9_gci212216,00.html"><FONT face=Tahoma color=#9f2201 size=2><EM>grok</EM></FONT></A><FONT face=Tahoma size=2><EM>" something that could have been explained in 10 minutes.</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2><EM>We thought it'd be interesting if we put together three days of presentations that were only 10 minutes long! Just the facts, just the technology, in a short format. We'll see presentations from folks you may have seen speak before like Scott Stanfield, Carl Franklin, Billy Hollis, myself, Juval Lowy, as well as a few from out of town, or the other side of that world that you may not have have had the opportunity to see.</EM></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Of course, <A href="http://www.larkware.com/dg3/TheDailyGrind633.html">Mike Gunderloy</A> pointed out one flaw:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2><EM>Frankly one reason I stopped going to Tech Ed was because too many of the 75-minute talks only had 10 minutes of content. Of course if these things are going to end up on the Web anyhow I still don't have any reason to go.</EM></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Good point. The downside of ideas that come outside of the group of people who are trying to up attendance. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But since it was announced after TechEd sold out it could not have been about that anyway. But it is about making things more available to more people. And that makes it a good idea.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I do think it is a very good idea, I plan to try and drop in on some of it if I have a chance.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But kind of like all of the times I think of great interview questions that I cannot use since there is not enough time to set them up, it is hard to do what I do in ten minute bites. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Unless you think I could start doing some of these blog posts. Some of <EM>them</EM> could be done in 10 minutes (although without the links to other posts there could be some trouble trying to use some of them effectively!).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>In any case, if you are going to TechEd in Orlando, I'd definitely check them out.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And be sure to stop by Dr. International's clinic (<STRONG>located in the Community Cabana across the hallway from the Developer Toolsâ€™ track cabana</STRONG>). I will be in there for a <EM>lot</EM> of the time that I am in Orlando....</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Aimee Mann's new album&nbsp;<STRONG>The Forgotten Arm</STRONG>&nbsp;is out! </FONT></P>
<P><IMG height=154 src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/TheForgottenArm.jpg" width=154></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The place you go to hear it and look into ordering it is on <A href="http://www.aimeemann.com/tfa_qt1/">Aimee's official site</A>&nbsp;and it is worth the trip, in my opinion. Between that and the links on <A href="http://www.aimeemann.com/">http://www.aimeemann.com/</A> I found the whole album in QuickTime, Flash, WMA, and Real formats. No stone left unturned, you can pretty much listen with whatever program you have. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><STRONG>The Forgotten Arm</STRONG> is a concept album. The title is a relatively obscure boxing term for a surprise punch (when I say obscure, I mean it was not mentioned in the Rocky movies; an actual boxer would probably be able to place it). It is a dozen songs that (loosely) tell the story of Caroline and John, a couple that meet at the Virginia State Fair in the early 1970s. John is a boxer who is fighting at the fair, ans Carolineis just a girl who wants to get out of town as soon as she can. They&nbsp;fall in love and take a road trip, not long before he is sent to Vietnam. Unfortunately, John develops a drug problem while he is there, and we get to watch him contemplate the relationship crashing and burning as he tries to find the courage to walk away. So there are many of the familiar Mann themes (addiction, dysfunctional relationships, etc.) but told with the experiences of this one couple, rather than in different situations. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I think it is really interesting, and I am liking it a lot. S</FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>o far I have listened to the whole CD and not heard any songs I didn't really like, though I think I like <EM>King of the Jailhouse</EM> (the second track) best so far. It has a quality about it that only a few other songs have (for me) where I could put it on repeat and listen to it over and over again -- other songs on that list include&nbsp;<EM>Sin City</EM> by Meredith Brooks,&nbsp;<EM>The Scientist</EM> or <EM>Warning Sign</EM> by Coldplay, <EM>the ballad of jill hennessy</EM> by&nbsp;mollycuddle,&nbsp;<EM>Wonderwall</EM> by Oasis, <EM>The Divorce&nbsp;Song</EM> by Liz Phair,&nbsp;<EM>How Soon is Now</EM> by The Smiths,&nbsp;<EM>Ray</EM> or&nbsp;<EM>Invisible Ink</EM> by Aimee Mann,&nbsp;<EM>Tale O' the Twister</EM>&nbsp;by Chagall Guevara, and&nbsp;<EM>Farther Down</EM> (and well most of the rest of the catalog) by Matthew Sweet. Though I think I will still request <EM>Ray</EM> in Amsterdam.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I had the good fortune to get a nice oversized version of the illustrated book that is included in the CD. Both books have all the illustrations done by Owen Smith, and the photography done by Sheryl Nields. Including this photograph that is on the last inside page of the book, next to the credits:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The&nbsp;picture has a caption in the book of "Aimee Mann, California 2005". Kind of makes you wonder at the fact that she will be celebrating her 45th birthday in four months. Makes me feel much older, if you know what I mean.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Anyway, the track listing for <STRONG>The Forgotten Arm</STRONG>:</FONT></P>

<LI><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>Beautiful</FONT></LI></OL>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>One more interesting site:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><A href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/guides/guide-display/-/27MN7F6UN5TOM/ref%3Dcd_sp_3c/102-8979300-7315316">Aimee Mann's list of Music You Should Hear</A></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Most of them are albums that I would consider to be well worth the listen, with the possible exception of Rod Stewart, who I have been unable to really get into since 1981. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I have also really been enjoying Mr. Hollywood Jr., 1947, the new Michael Penn album, though that is the only one on the list that is not available yet so you could consider that one to be the teaser of the list (though since Ms. Mann is married to Mr. Penn one would assume she has been able to listen to it now and again). I'll probably talk more about&nbsp;his album&nbsp;when it is closer to being released though, so stay tuned if you are a Michael Penn fan....</FONT></P>

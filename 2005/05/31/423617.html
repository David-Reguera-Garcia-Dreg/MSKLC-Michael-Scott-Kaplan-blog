<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=5><STRONG>Something special for IT Pros (and maybe for some developers!)</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I will be doing miniature versions of talks I have done before on keyboards -- how they work, how to develop them, how to deploy them. This will happen in Dr. International's clinic (<STRONG>located in the Community Cabana across the hallway from the Developer Toolsâ€™ track cabana</STRONG>) during one of the many times I am there, for anyone who is interested. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>If you are one of the interested parties then let me know and I will try and get some times noticed. Or maybe I should sign up for some of those <A href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/TechEd2005WhatIsAGrokTalk.aspx">GrokTalk</A> slots? </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Scott, what do you think? :-)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Almost a week ago, I talked about <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/05/13/417167.html">What it means to be in the default install</A>.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And about a week ago, Richie Rump talked about <A class=singleposttitle id=viewpost.ascx_TitleUrl href="http://jorriss.com/dottext/jorriss/archive/2005/05/12/619.aspx">Windows Mobile 5.0 Unveiled</A>.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And then also a week ago, I got an email from a developer who asked the following.</FONT></P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><FONT face=Tahoma>I’m figuring you might have an opinion on the likelihood of a patch being released to provide Uniscribe support to Windows Mobile 5.0 being released (also would that require flashing the whole ROM or something?). . . is it a done deal that it really, really wasn’t included in what will be Windows Mobile 5.0?</FONT></SPAN></FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><FONT face=Tahoma>...tons of potential U.S. Government Arabic program contracts?&nbsp; ...personally I want better Hebrew support on the Pocket PC, but the Arabic stuff seems more compelling. I do know of local businesses that deal with that sort of thing.)<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /><o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Tahoma size=2><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><o:p></o:p></SPAN></FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><FONT face=Tahoma>Do you know of any nifty (existing or future potential) tricks to provide Uniscribe support on the Pocket PC short of rolling your own Windows Mobile and flashing their ROM?<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE></SPAN></FONT></FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>You may see where I am going with this. </FONT></FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>In the words of Rob Reiner and Tom Hanks, "what do they call it when everything intersects? The Bermuda Triangle." :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>From a historical perspective, I have done talks about international usage on devices (both for SQL Server, Windows CE Edition and for Embedded VB) -- and I have also worked with contractors who had to build devices with custom components for language. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I once (not too many years ago) even did an informational with Lori, then almost a Director who was interested in seeing me do the original port of Uniscribe to Windows CE. They had some trouble figuring out the logistics of when/how it would be done, and I ended up taking <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/02/12/371650.html">another job in her group</A>, from someone who works for Lori. But luckily they found someone else who did the job and by all reports did an excellent job getting&nbsp;Uniscribe onto the device. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But I do not honestly know what the plan is here. As far as I know, if you are building a CE platform, you include the smallest set you can get away with, and unless you are targetting languges that need complex script support, you may not include the locale, collation, font, or rendering support for any language/script you are not targetting. Which means you may have to build a platform to get this support.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I got my Platform Builder many years ago back when it was just the cost of shipping the many CDs (which may no longer be true). </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But if someone has better news or knows more about this, they should feel free to post a comment here about their knowledge!</FONT></P>

<p><strong>Alex Cohn</strong> on 29 Sep 2009 10:26 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>I wonder why there is no continuation for this issue. It is Windows Mobile 6.1 now, and still no way to have uniscribe on a smartphone! To some extent, this allows 3rd party companies like Paragon and Enron to come up with hooks and earn good money for their hard work. But now the application developers must comply with all available solutions, and they often miss some compatibility issues. </p>
<p>I understand that adding complex script support for all smartphones will simply cause many millions of users pay with their ROM for something they will never use. But maybe it is possible to build a MiddleEast version of Windows Mobile with Platform Builder?</p></div>

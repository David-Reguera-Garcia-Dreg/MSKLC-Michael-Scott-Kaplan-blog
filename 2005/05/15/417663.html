<P><EM><FONT face=Tahoma>(Nothing technical in this post, sorry!)</FONT></EM></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It was really sunny yesterday. This works well since I have a convertible and got to run with the top down.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I do need to point out that only an optimist could ever live in Seattle and own a convertible. It's not the rain so much as the gray, the "it might start raining soon" that plagues all but the summer months here.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So a big raspberry to all of the people who think I am a pessimist. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Anyway, today was not quite so sunny. I decided to get some of the General's Noodles from <A href="http://www.typhoonrestaurants.com/locredmond.htm">Typhoon!</A> and I had not put the top up yet. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I decided to leave it down; it was not raining right now, and I figured if everything went wrong it would just be a few drops.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So I stuck in Beta Band CD into the car and made it to Typhoon and back, all on just one playing of the song. There were a few drops of rain on the windshield but nothing you'd really notice.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Amazing good luck, I think. Maybe to counter all the bad luck lately.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I do really like that song. I liked the Beta Band even before they saw a small revival from the movie version of Nick Hornby's excellent book, High Fidelity. Though I liked the book better; England is a cooler setting for than Chicago, even if that meant John Cusack wouldn't be able to star in it. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>No intent to disrespect John,&nbsp;he did fine in the surrounding movies of 1999 and 2001 anyway. </FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>And while we are on that topic, I think <A href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0240890/">Serendipity</A> is at least 70% of a <A href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0098258/">Say Anything</A>&nbsp;(and Rob Gordon is about 60% of a Llyod Dobbler). If you don't know what I mean you probably ought to see both movies at some point (I have seen them 41 and 111 times, respectively -- more proof that I suck as a pessimist?). Take someone you love or someone you think you might love at some point. If you know what I mean (if you don't then you should definitely see the movies).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Nothing else to post about really. Just enjoying the day, and the noodles.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>One more thing -- the movie&nbsp;<A href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0119643/">Meet Joe Black</A> is on right now. Now I think <A href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0001231/">Claire Forlani</A> is just fine as an actress (though I probably liked her better in <A href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0218817/">Antitrust</A>, a movie which did not do much for me otherwise). Anyway, wouldn't Meet Joe Black have been just two hours (rather than the 3:10 it clocked in as) if more of this woman's meaningful pauses and&nbsp;stares ended up on the cutting floor? I don't think the movie would have suffered any for it.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I'm just saying....</FONT></P>

I drove a (much newer) Pontiac the last time I was in the US, and while it had a big engine, it felt like I was driving a cruise ship, rather than a car... :)</div>

Oh, no frame portraing Claire's face is a wasted one, so I disagree about cutting any of her stares :-)</div>

The Beta Band is really good live - you have to try to catch them if they come by.  A few years ago, they were opening for Radiohead; I'm really sorry I missed that pairing.</div>
<p><a id="418983" href="#418983">#</a> <strong>Wes Miller</strong> on 17 May 2005 9:40 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Even with GM owning them, Saabs are only American if you are talking about the SUV 9-7X... Thankfully GM let Saab run free for a long time with the 900/9-3 and 9000/9-5 - but no more (9-7X, a badge engineered GM and 9-2X, a badge engineered Subaru WRX). Sad times - may it hopefully keep the marque alive for making other more traditional Saabs.<br><br>MHO, of course: Say Anything, Grosse Pointe Blank, and Better Off Dead... best 3 Cusack movies in order. :-)</div>
<p><a id="418988" href="#418988">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 17 May 2005 10:07 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">We have to love the Saab-aru, right? :-)</div>
<p><a id="419138" href="#419138">#</a> <strong>Wes Miller</strong> on 18 May 2005 9:16 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">I so wanted to like the Saab-aru... Being both a Saab and Subaru fan. But I got one as a loaner last Friday when my 9-3 SE was in getting a bit of work. Had a tempting sounding engine (by the numbers), but had a really horrific 4-speed automatic that sapped any of the fun out of the engine. Nearly 10 seconds with the gas floored to force an upshift on the highway. <br><br>Ah well - nothing like a loaner to make you love your car even more when you get it back! :-)</div>

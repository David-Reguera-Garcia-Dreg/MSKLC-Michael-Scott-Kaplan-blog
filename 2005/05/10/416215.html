<P><FONT face=Tahoma>That's right, the well known <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/DrIntl/default.mspx">Dr. International</A> now has a blog, subtitled <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/drintl/">Thoughts, tips, questions and suggestions â€“ all things international</A>. Definitely a good add to the list of <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2004/12/18/325156.html">blogs I read</A>!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The Doctor starts of strong with a post entitled </FONT><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/drintl/archive/2005/05/10/416192.aspx"><FONT face=Tahoma>Hello World / Testing localized product on English OS vs localized OS</FONT></A><FONT face=Tahoma>. The post includes the information about the Doctor's identity:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><STRONG>As for "Who is Dr. International?",<BR></STRONG>Dr. International's identity is one of the most closely guarded secrets of Microsoft. Since (1)&nbsp;I have&nbsp;the support and help of the entire Windows Global Platforms Technologies and Services Group, (2)&nbsp;I am&nbsp;very knowledgeable about&nbsp;international issues, and (3)&nbsp;I get to choose what questions/answers are posted, I will be able to maintain the illusion of knowing everything. ;^)</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Definitely worth checking out over the coming weeks and months....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And I am out of breath after finding a ton of interesting issues to post about today. I am going to have slow down and pace myself. :-)</FONT></P>

The Doctor is on the opposite side of the hall, or building, or the continent, or something like that. And no one even knows who it is (though I used to think I knew, way back at the beginning).</div>

For example, on this post the HTTP Content-Type header has charset=utf-8, but I saw the sequence E2 80 93 instead of the intended en-dash U+2013.<br><br>I think it's IE at fault because Fiddler (www.fiddlertool.com) shows utf-8 on both the base page and on customcss.aspx?app=michkap, for both requests. It's a very random failure.</div>
<p><a id="416420" href="#416420">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 11 May 2005 8:42 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Mike, apologies are never needed. :-)<br><br>I have not seen this problem before, but it is troubling. Especially if the browser is being given solid clues as to what the encoding is, the idea that it is overriding that is hard to fathom. Do you have more info on the pages that seem to show this problem?<br><br>It just occurred to me that I have seen a similar problem, described in this post:<br><br><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/03/21/399589.html">http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/archive/2005/03/21/399589.aspx</a><br><br>but that has a clear cause, just no good solutions beyond rearchitecting MSDN online. I do not think this could be the cause of what you are seeing, could it?<br><br>You may actually want to ask Dr. International about the issue -- the Doctor may either have insight into the problem or the ability to consult with someone who does....</div>

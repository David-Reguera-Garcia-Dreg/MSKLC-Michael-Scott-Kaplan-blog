<h1>A better question -- what is the performance, Everett vs. Whidbey?</h1>

<P><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ricom/default.aspx"><FONT face=Tahoma>Rico Mariani</FONT></A><FONT face=Tahoma> decided to try a managed version of the </FONT><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/05/10/416008.html"><FONT face=Tahoma>dictionary</FONT></A><FONT face=Tahoma>&nbsp;I talked about earlier today. According to Rico, the question of the hour is:&nbsp; <STRONG>How does Raymond's program fare vs. the equivalent managed code below?</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But as far as I am concerned, the question of the hour is <STRONG>Where is this code faster -- in the 1.1 or the 2.0 version of the .NET Framework?</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The reason I ask is that there have been some definite cool changes in Whidbey around in encodings between versions -- previously the .NET Framework would simply wrap the Win32 APIs (meaning you could only support the code pages that were installed on the machine) but in the new version there is an independent implementation that will work on all platforms where .NET can be installed....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It probably also makes for a more interesting test to compare Whidbey vs. Raymond's original code, to avoid the hit of the old, wrapper version of the same functions that the unmanaged code was calling....</FONT></P>

Windows 3.11, 95, 98, NT and XP are NOT  different computing platforms. They are just (slightly) different operating systems with One common API, there is only ONE platform associated with them all - Wintel. See <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_</a>(computing)   <br>.</div>

A platform might be simply defined as 'a place to launch software'. Platforms are frequently mentioned with APIs. A complete suite of APIs constitute another type of platform. Platform frequently are referred to as operating systems as defined above. However they are not always the same thing. For example, 2 other popular non-OS platforms are Java, as mentioned above, and BREW for mobile phones.<br>----------------------------<br><br>Since I am a software person and other than a  small keyboard fetish (I have 15 different language keyboards) don't really do anything special with hardware at all. So it is a natural and obvious thing for me to be talking about software platforms, and almost everything I say here refers equally to IA64 and x64. :-)</div>

A big backward step currently (VS Beta2)</div>

<p><a id="416447" href="#416447">#</a> <strong>Anonymous Coward!</strong> on 11 May 2005 9:53 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">I guess the definition for a &quot;platform&quot; is so loose that you can stretch it to almost any extent. To me calling Windows 9x NT XP as different platforms is far too overkill. Linux is a platform - Linux/x86, Linux x86_64, Linux Alpha ... etc. are NOT different platforms since the OS provides the exact same API to applications.<br>I don't understand it when you say Windows NT and  XP are so different to be called separate platforms. Both support the Win32 API correct? There might be additional facilities available in XP but that surely does not qualify it as a different platform.</div>
<p><a id="416454" href="#416454">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 11 May 2005 10:22 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Someone once pointed out that if a martian were to look at all human languages, they would probably say they are &quot;the same&quot;. Does this make it any easier to understand any language, instantly?<br><br>Of course not.<br><br>The differences between platforms are huge, even when the changes are not noticed by most. That is why it is easy when you are up close to say that Win2000 and XP are two different platforms -- because in many senses, they are.</div>
<p><a id="416456" href="#416456">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 11 May 2005 10:34 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">But to give the whole issue context -- a platform in the most generic sense is a base, from which you can build. Thus 2000 and XP, .NET 1.1 or 2.0 are all platforms, and whether you consider some of them to be different versions of the same platform does not mean that you are not talking about platforms.</div>

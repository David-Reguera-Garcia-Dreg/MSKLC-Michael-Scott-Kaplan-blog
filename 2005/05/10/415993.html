<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Over in <A href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/">The Language Log</A>, Bill Poser reports in <A href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002141.html">LOST IN TRANSLATION</A> about an interesting step that the government of Gaeltacht in Ireland (a region where Irish&nbsp;is still common) has taken to help assure the continuing use of Irish -- they have taken down bilingual (Irish/English) road signs and replaced them with monolingual Irish ones.

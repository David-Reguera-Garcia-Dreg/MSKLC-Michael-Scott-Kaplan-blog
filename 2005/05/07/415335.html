<h1>Longhorn on Virtual PC 2004</h1>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Well, I had a few idle moments today, so I thought I would try to do what a ton of Beta sites would be doing as soon as Beta 1 of Longhorn hit the streets. Install it on a Virtual PC image.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>These days, the smart beta testers are always using products like Virtual PC for their betas -- better to keep one's own machines clean, right.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So, I got started....</FONT></P>
<P><IMG style="WIDTH: 303px; HEIGHT: 190px" height=402 src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/setup.jpg" mce_src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/setup.jpg"></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>No, I am not going to give everyone a ton of screen shots. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I thought I would point out one problem I had though. When I tried to pick the drive to install to, Longhorn would not recognize the VPC drive. To get it to recognize the drive, I did the following:</FONT></P>
<OL>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Started to install Windows XP</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>As soon as the initial NTFS formatting of the drive was done, I removed the CD and chose to reset the VPC session</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>I then installed Longhorn -- it was able to recognize the drive once it was formatted</FONT></LI></OL>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It was a fairly easy workaround, but it did inspire a momentary panic when I first thought that Virtual PC might not be available for the beta. There may not be&nbsp;an&nbsp;immediate&nbsp;fix it it is a Virtual PC 2004 issue,&nbsp;after all.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I then played around a bit after it was installed, everything seemed functional. I then thought I would test out something that had been pointed out by a colleague who had been experimenting with a small setup change (translation: "was goofing off in the late afternoon"). I did&nbsp;the same&nbsp;somewhat destructive act on the registry and then rebooted my virtual Longhorn image. In prior versions this would cause the following effect:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><IMG style="HEIGHT: 186px" height=273 src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/Black.jpg" width=262 mce_src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/Black.jpg"></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Not the most intuitive message, huh? Well, you can file this next bit in the "truth is stranger then fiction" department.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>A while back, BBspot ran an article entitled <A href="http://www.bbspot.com/Features/2000/9/ms_years.html" mce_href="http://www.bbspot.com/Features/2000/9/ms_years.html">Microsoft: The Next 25 Years</A>. One of the predictive entries read:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><EM><STRONG>2016</STRONG>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Microsoft enhances their only innovation by introducing the "Red Screen of Death."&nbsp; </EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Well, here on Longhorn, roughly 11 years early:</FONT></P>
<P><IMG style="WIDTH: 512px; HEIGHT: 356px" height=356 src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/Red.jpg" width=512 mce_src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/Red.jpg"></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Well, that will teach me, right? Luckily the recovery was easy (just rebooted, went to "last known good", undid that destructive operation, and then rebooted. And all was right with the world.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I am not sure I would class the change as an improvement. I mean, the old message ("<STRONG>Windows cannot start because the following file is missing or corrupt: \WINDOWS\System32</STRONG>") is one I understand since I know what the destructive operation was. But if I did not have that knowledge then I would not know much about what was going on.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The new message, though, is even harder to understand (though an internet search of 0xc000000f&nbsp;will see it relates to Windows File Protection, which I guess is a hint.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Lucky for me that this is not the sort of thing one sees unless one is intentionally performing destructive operations, huh? :-)</FONT></P>

There must be some research on visual imaging to suggest a color that would make people feel good about an error :-) How about ocean blue...with two margarita bottles and a plam tree in the right bottom corner.</div>

I remember doing that in DOS through the BIOS (INT 10h - slow!) or directly through the VGA card (OUT 3C8, was it? It was really fast!).</div>

I made a boot screen almost EXACTLY like that as far are the White Windows Flag with the small &quot;TM&quot; logo goes. What I did was copy the setup.bmp from the Windows XP install CD and converted it to a 16-colour 640x480 bitmap with a teal background and used it as the background for the PowerQuest BootMagic boot-loader OS selection menu.<br><br>I also use the same bitmap as the Startup splash screen of my BIOS. I just find it a remarkable co-incidence that the image that I have been using for all my pre-boot sequences except for the Actual OS startup screen (the BIOS and Boot Loader) has as of longhorn so far, has become part of the OS startup screen.<br><br>Or maybe I am mistaken and the one of the XP CD was already 16-colour but the background was not a solid background colour, it alternated between black and blue pixels instead of a nice smooth teal/black.</div>

I am looking forward to this session.  Can't wait to see Dr International's Clinic too.</div>
<p><a id="420086" href="#420086">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 19 May 2005 11:18 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Yep, I have high hopes about this topic. From a high level view the slides are more complex than the level, but the talk itself is good to the level and acts as a great intro to understanding the things that are more complicated (and also points to issues that the second talk covers that might be of interest!)</div>

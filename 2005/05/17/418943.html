<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Someone just pointed this one out to me today: <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jfoscoding/archive/2005/01/24/359334.aspx">Probably more than you want to know about keyboarding in Windows Formsâ€¦.</A></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It is one of many posts on <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jfoscoding/default.aspx">jfo's coding</A>, a blog that I will definitely be adding to my list. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Sometimes the best way to get smarter is to just shut up and listen when smart people are talking. And because of that, I have known to pay attention to Jessica's emails on internal lists at Microsoft, as she definitely knows her stuff. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>For the record, I am embarrassed about how much easier it would have been to code <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/tools/msklc.mspx">MSKLC</A> if I had known even 20% of the information in her post about WinForms keyboarding. And I know who to try and get to do code reviews of the next version! :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>That was a truly awesome post....</FONT></P>

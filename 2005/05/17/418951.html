<P><FONT face=Tahoma>You may have noticed the new graphic on the side there.&nbsp; As I mentioned <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/04/07/406212.html">previously</A>, I will be in Amsterdam for <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/europe/teched/">TechEd Europe 2005</A>.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The talks will be mostly the same as the ones in Orlando, but with two important differences --&nbsp;(1) I </FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>will have all of the feedback from Orlando to work with before taking the stage, and (2) a whole different set of customers to talk to!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Then the other advantage is that I will finally get to meet so many of the people who live around here that I never manage to run into, from Betsy Aoki (cf: </FONT><FONT face=Tahoma><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/betsya/archive/2005/05/17/418934.aspx">Hear me speak about blogging at TechEd Amsterdam</A>) to Kimberly Tripp (nothing on <A href="http://www.sqlskills.com/blogs/kimberly/default.aspx">her blog</A> yet, but she listed as one of the <A href="http://www.mseventseurope.com/TechEd/05/Pre/Content/TopSpeakers.aspx">top speakers</A> on the TechEd site so I will assume they managed to sign her up!).</FONT></P>

We noticed that being in the same city did not help us see each other; when we were in the same place, it was always on the opposite side of this country or in another country entirely.<br><br>I have no idea what the name of this phenomenon is, or why it happens.</div>

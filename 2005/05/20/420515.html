<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The Globalization Services team inside of GIFT is expanding again, and we are looking for a Software Development Enginner (developer)!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>As a team, we are responsible for many of the underlying technologies and features that I have been blogging about every day. We do the core international support for Windows and the .NET Framework and provide a lot of the data used by Office, Windows CE, SQL Server, XBOX, and other groups at Microsoft. As I have mentioned before, we combine the technical and linguistic expertise to provide the best possible support for the millions of customers of all of these products.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>If the area of globalization on Microsoft platforms is of interest to you (which it may well be, if you are reading this blog!), then this is your chance to be where it is all happening, to <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/05/03/414161.html">return to the source</A>, as it were. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The listing for the position can be found <A href="http://members.microsoft.com/careers/search/details.aspx?JobID=8DD1961A-7373-4B46-8FB0-9FC88A13DC24">right here</A>.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>If the position and the group sound interesting to you and you would like to pursue the opportunity, I would definitely encourage you to submit your resume. The information for submitting your resume can be found there as well.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I will moderate all comments for <EM>this</EM> post and not&nbsp;unmoderate&nbsp;them unless you ask me to (I will follow up with you by email) -- think of it as a convenient way to ask questions about what working here is like, etc.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And if you decide to go for it, good luck and maybe I'll be seeing you soon!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><EM>(I may be posting about additional positions in other disciplines soon -- the growth is not just in development!)</EM></FONT></P>

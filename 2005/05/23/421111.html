<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Here it is -- I <STRONG>did</STRONG> mention that <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/05/20/420515.html">We're hiring</A>. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>That pointer is to a development postion. It turns out we also need a technical feature PM (program manager) too!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The listing is <A href="http://members.microsoft.com/careers/search/details.aspx?JobID=7BF9D2B6-69AD-495F-BE17-2CC0FA02B4DD">right here</A>, and it has a lot of good detail about the kind of person we are looking for. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Both positions are very cool opportunities to get into Microsoft with the team that was cool enough to convince me to convert to a full-time employee.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>As I said before, if&nbsp;<FONT face=Tahoma>either position and the group sound interesting to you and you would like to pursue one of the opportunities, I would definitely encourage you to submit your resume. The information for submitting your resume can be found in the position listing as well.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I will moderate all comments for <EM>this</EM> post and not&nbsp;unmoderate&nbsp;them unless you ask me to (I will follow up with you by email) -- think of it as a convenient way to ask questions about what working here is like, etc.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And if you decide to go for it, good luck and maybe I'll be seeing you soon!</FONT></P></FONT>

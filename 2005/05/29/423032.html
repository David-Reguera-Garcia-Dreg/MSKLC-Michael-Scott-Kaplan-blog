<P><FONT face=Tahoma>In years past, I had seen shows at the Front Row Theatre in Cleveland (it is no longer around, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is on the site where it used to be). I was struck at the time by the way that the performer would be facing different parts of the audience at different times. So you did not always get the performers, but you got all of them for some of the time....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Anyway, in years past when doing technical presentations in places like Stockholm and Amsterdam, I would usually work to get my slides localized -- of course in a bilingual form so I could still read them! :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><EM>(Also, when speaking in London I would try to get rid the Americanisms when I "localised" them)</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I was thinking about maybe trying to do the same thing for TechEd in July, but I realized that a lot of the attendees will be coming from all over Europe, so trying to get them localized into Dutch may not really capture as much. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So I thought about that long-gone venue and started toying with the idea&nbsp;of trying to get&nbsp;different slides done in different languages, all over Europe. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It would roughly analagous to letting lots of people see some of the show localized, whether it was text in Nederlands, Frysk, Deutsch, français, ελληνικά, español, suomi, Magyar, íslenska, italiano, norsk, polski, Português, română, русский, hrvatski, slovenčina, shqipe, svenska, Türkçe, україньска, Беларускі, slovenski, eesti, bosanski, latviešu, lietuvių, euskara, македонски, srpski, Elsässisch, Occitan, Corsu, brezhoneg, hornjoserbšćina, Lëtzebuergesch, Rumantsch, Cymraeg, åarjelsaemiengiele, or any other language across Europe.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So, does it sound interesting? Comments welcome!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Do you speak any of these languages and would you like to help out? You can send a piece of email to me at <STRONG>michkap -at- microsoft.com</STRONG> (munge in the obvious way!).</FONT></P>

<p><a id="423065" href="#423065">#</a> <strong>Mihai</strong> on 29 May 2005 5:46 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">I am not sure how are you going to display the slides in so many languages. Or are you going to distribute localized slides to the participants and display only the English version?<br>Then you should consider distributing printed versions, since not all participants will have laptops.<br>But then you have another problem: how many do you need for each language?<br>See, is not that easy :-)<br>Anyway, if you decide to do this, I can translate into &quot;rom&#226;nă&quot; :-)</div>

<p><a id="423072" href="#423072">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 29 May 2005 6:22 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Mihai -- I am saying that each slide would have one other language, not that I would try to get every slide translated into every language -- the latter would be way too hard to orchestrate! I'll follow up on the other with you offline....<br><br>robdoyle -- thats why I put that &quot;or any other language across Europe. :-)</div>

I'm a native spanish speaker and lived in Italy for 3 years. I still work with some italian guys here in Cyprus so I haven't forgotten the language, unfortunately I haven't learnt greek yet :P<br><br>Ok, if you are interested, drop me a mail: agonza@gmail.com<br><br>Adrian</div>

<p><a id="423228" href="#423228">#</a> <strong>Kate Gregory</strong> on 30 May 2005 11:32 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">I have done cross-Canada speaking tours many times. On one occasion we decided to get the slides translated into French for the Quebec City and Montreal events. I am always simultaneously translated at these events anyway. So I spoke in English to French slides, but most of the audience was hearing a French translation and seeing French slides. It wasn't hard at all... I knew the deck well and most technical terms are the same in French and English. Also lots of i18n talks start with a few slides in another alphabet. So why not? As long as the full deck is available in English too.</div>

<p><a id="424230" href="#424230">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 2 Jun 2005 7:08 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Hi Matt -- I could be holding out a false hope then. And Nederland just voted to not accept the EU constitution, too. Sigh....</div>
<p><a id="440476" href="#440476">#</a> <strong>uhhh</strong> on 19 Jul 2005 1:17 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">the front row theatre was not located where the rock hall now sits</div>

I never actually went to the latter, only to the former. So I am relying on internet hearsay as my source....</div>

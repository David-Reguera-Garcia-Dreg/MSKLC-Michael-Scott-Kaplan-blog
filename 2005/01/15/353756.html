<h1>Search here or search for info on Unicode characters!</h1>

<P>Ok, now appearing on <STRONG>Sorting It All Out</STRONG>, over on the left side of the screen, are search links for Google and MSN, as well as a link for searching for Unicode information at <A href="http://fileformat.info/">http://FileFormat.Info</A>&nbsp;(special thanks to Andrew for permission!).</P>
<P>I am not going to try to talk up either MSN Search or Google, I am sure you know what both of them are already. </P>
<P>But I will talk up the stuff at FileFormat.Info as it is very cool. You can search by code point in many forms (e.g. U+270D, &amp;#9997;, 0x270D, etc.) as well as by Unicode name. You can even look at what other people have been looking for at <A href="http://www.fileformat.info/search/recent.htm"><U><FONT color=#0000ff>http://www.fileformat.info/search/recent.htm</U></FONT></A>&nbsp;if you are curious what sort of characters interest other people. A very cool site, one I would highly recommend any time you are looking up Unicode character information!</P>
<P>Special thanks to Drew for pointing out David Crump's site and the info there about search links. I was about 90% done with a&nbsp;different solution involving HTML forms that I could not seem to figure out on a Saturday afternoon, but that other solution plugged in quite nicely and appears to work well.</P>

Not sure what you are seeing, but the links are pretty straightforward. <br><br>Maybe a proxy issue on your end?<br><br></div>

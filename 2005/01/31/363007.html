<P>Yes, here is where you can suggest a topic for future coverage by <EM>Sorting it all Out</EM>. I will allow any item that even remotely&nbsp;makes sense for me to cover, and will probably remove items after they are covered. We'll see how it goes, I am new at this....</P>
<P>As people have&nbsp;noticed, I have been putting some of the topics that have been growing on me to write about.... I'll probably keep doing that.</P>
<P>(Due to the way the blog server is set up, comments close in 30 days. At that point a new suggestion page gets set up every 30 days, if I don't forget to create a new one. I'll try to not forget. :-)</P>

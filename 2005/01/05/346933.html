<P>Earlier this morning, Peter Ibbotson asked me:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr>
<P><FONT size=2><EM>Perhaps you explain something to me (I appreciate you may be the wrong person to ask, but you seem to be a sorting expert). When XP was in beta I put a bug report on this odd sorting behaviour with explorer, given a directory containing the following files: </EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>C:\sorttest&gt;dir /on /b <BR>X12.TXT <BR>X13.TXT <BR>X1A.TXT <BR>X1B.TXT <BR>XAB.TXT </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><EM>Shows in this order (when sorted by name) in explorer: </EM><BR>X1A.TXT <BR>X1B.TXT <BR>X12.TXT <BR>X13.TXT <BR>XAB.TXT </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><EM>I've never understood why this happens (and it drives me nuts sometimes) Oh I'm in the UK in case that makes any difference.</EM></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>I can speak to this question. :-)</P>
<P>The first method is the method that has existed for ages on computers and with which a geek such as myself is likely to be most comfortable -- treating numbers as bits of text, each individual number of which&nbsp;is compared to an individual letter. You can get it by calling <A title=CompareString href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winui/winui/windowsuserinterface/resources/strings/stringreference/stringfunctions/comparestring.asp" target=_blank>CompareString</A> or <A title=LCMapString href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/intl/nls_5s2v.asp" target=_blank>LCMapString</A>, and everything is great.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, it is also incredibly nonintitive to all of the people who are not geeks.</P>
<P>Try explaining to your mom that <EM>30.txt</EM> is supposed to come after <EM>100.txt</EM>. Its not a pretty sight:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr>
<P><EM>Mom: It just makes no sense to me, dear. 30 is less than 100!</EM></P>
<P><EM>Son: Yes, when it's a number. But what about when you treat it as text?</EM></P>
<P><EM>Mom:&nbsp;How can a number be text?</EM></P>
<P><EM>Son: Well, anything can be text. There is a difference between 4 and "4".</EM></P>
<P><EM>Mom: &lt;shakes head&gt; It just makes no sense to me, dear. </EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>And the outrageous thing is that she is actually right.</P>
<P>Now the Shell team at Microsoft is pretty amazing (and not just the famous ones like <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/OldNewThing">Raymond Chen</A>). </P>
<P>There are those who whine when things other people do are not able to support their customers.&nbsp;That is <STRONG>not</STRONG> the Shell team, though. They are the ones who go write the code to support those customers. Thats pretty impressive to me.</P>
<P>Anyway, they have been getting feedback on this scenario for some time. And they finally did something about it. That API is <A title=StrCmpLogicalW href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/shell/reference/shlwapi/string/strcmplogicalw.asp" target=_blank>StrCmpLogicalW</A>, and it basically recognizes that 95% of the world treats the digits as <STRONG>numbers</STRONG> rather than text. And therefore it notices that 30.txt comes before 100.txt without having to zero-pad the numbers.</P>
<P>I have looked at the source for that function and every once in a while I even would use the problem as an interview question after seeing the clever solution they used (no, I do not use it anymore!). but it is a good solution to the problem of extending a function like CompareString to treat digits as numbers rather than text.</P>
<P>Of course the Windows Explorer, which is the Shell team's most important public face, uses this (unless you turn it off with group policy, which some people do).</P>
<P>In theory the command window could do the same in the <STRONG>Dir</STRONG> function,&nbsp;because&nbsp;as Peter pointed out the inconsistency is a tad noticable.</P>
<P>Other people ask about hex digits, which would be easy if the letters ABCDEF did not also have part time jobs as actual letters that must always be treated as text. Luckily this can also be answered by the core scenario that drove the API -- the type of person who is confused by the "digits as text" behavior is probably not using hexidecimal digits.</P>
<P>Thinking to my own areas of expertise it seems like a shame that ASCII 0-9 are handled but the other 20+ streams of digits, including the fullwidth to&nbsp;０&nbsp;to ９. Of course in some cases it is not really known what people would prefer, and as a function that it is in its heart of hearts designed to be intuitive its probably important to understand the expectations prior to blazing forth. Getting that feedback first would be important....</P>
<P>Plus I have to think about <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2004/12/30/344389.html">sort keys</A>. They are pretty central to databases, and there is a design principle in our sort key implementation&nbsp;that LCMapString and CompareString should give back equivalent results in terms of&nbsp;comparisons. But creating sort keys that can handle strings of digits of unbounded size is not a trivial problem to consider (that too would maybe make a fun interview question but also a frustrating one so i don't think I'll try it).</P>
<P>Anyway, that's why one can get back different results across all locales when one looks at lists from the <STRONG>Dir</STRONG> function versus from Explorer. In fact, you may be able to use as a test of "geek-ness" how long it takes you to admit the truth in the overall scenario above (I have been "out" as a geek for years so I revel in the fact, but not every geek realizes it about themselves!).</P>

<p><a id="347221" href="#347221">#</a> <strong>Dean Harding</strong> on 5 Jan 2005 2:42 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">One possible way would be to go through each file name and pad any numbers with zero up to a fixed length and then sort with the regular <a title="CompareString" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winui/winui/windowsuserinterface/resources/strings/stringreference/stringfunctions/comparestring.asp" target="_blank">CompareString</a> function.<br><br>The only two problems with that would be 1. It's not very efficient to modify all the file names, especially for very long directory listings, and 2. It's difficult to know how much padding you need.<br><br>For 2. the obvious solution is to check the maximum length of a string of digits in all the file names and use that (so for example, if you have 3.txt and 1000.txt then you need to pad the first file with three zeros), but that just makes 1. more obvious (since you need to loop through all the file names once to find the maximum length of a string of digits, and again to actually pad digits).<br><br>For 1. I'm not sure how you could make it quicker, and still be able to use the normal CompareString to do the main work, because you'd /want/ to use the normal CompareString function otherwise you'd end up having to rewrite a very complex function for a fairly small gain.</div>

To be clear I am talking about the code that shipped with Server 2003 and then later in XP service packs.... :-) <br><br>To Dean -- think of another issue -- what about the file A1A1A1A1A1A1A1A1A1A1A1A1A1A1.txt? Do you extend every one of those numbers?</div>
<p><a id="347324" href="#347324">#</a> <strong>Dean Harding</strong> on 5 Jan 2005 4:06 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Ah, good point.<br><br>OK, another solution would be to sort it normally first.  This'll get all the text-based ordering out of the way, and at least all the files with the same prefix and numbered suffixes will be together.  So lets say you start off like this:<br><br>a.txt, b1.txt, def20.txt, b20.txt, def6.txt, b9.txt, c.txt<br><br>After you do your normal <a title="CompareString" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winui/winui/windowsuserinterface/resources/strings/stringreference/stringfunctions/comparestring.asp" target="_blank">CompareString</a> sort, you'd have this:<br><br>a.txt b1.txt, b20.txt, b9.txt, c.txt, def20.txt, def6.txt<br><br>Then you can group them so that files with the same prefix followed by a digit are in a group, this'd give two groups:<br><br>b1.txt, b20.txt, b9.txt and<br>def20.txt, def6.txt<br><br>Then it's just a matter of extracting the number from the correct position in each file name, and sorting by that number in-place.  So your two groups become:<br><br>b1.txt, b9.txt, b20.txt and<br>def6.txt, def20.txt<br><br>And the whole thing is:<br><br>a.txt, b1.txt, b9.txt, b20.txt, c.txt, def6.txt, def20.txt<br><br>This way, you don't modify strings, you don't have to worry about padding with zero, and you'll still get the correct answer (I think :)</div>

The difference between numbers and numerals was taught there, and numerals are text.  Different numeral bases came up in grade 6, which should make it more obvious that numerals are text.<br><br>Nonetheless, sorting them as numbers instead of numerals is indeed agreeable 95% of the time.  I only wonder, as you said you do, why Windows Explorer only does it around 50% of the time instead of 95% of the time.<br><br>Since there are some APIs now that recognize the numericity of various kinds of characters, one would think that Explorer would properly sort the department names of the company that I work in, but no I have to find the folder in order by the pronunciation of the number[*] instead of the numeric value.  Dai-ichi-nani-nani, dai-san-nani-nani, dai-yon-nani-nani[*], dai-ni-nani-nani, 1 3 4 2 and the 4 isn't even in the expected place by pronunciation[*].<br><br>[* The matter of multiple pronunciations of a Kanji has been discussed in other threads.  The character meaning four is getting sorted by pronunciation shi instead of yon, which is understandable but still not the first place one would look for it.  I've never heard anyone say &quot;dai-shi-nani-nani&quot;, it's &quot;dai-yon-nani-nani&quot;.]</div>

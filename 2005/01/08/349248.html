<h1>Post titles here will not always be relevant</h1>

<P>Kind of an answer to Robert Scoble's plea to <A href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/08.html#a9133">please write better RSS headlines</A>.</P>
<P>Sometimes my posts will have relevant titles, sometimes they may even have relevant content. </P>
<P>But as I told people years ago when they asked me why I was so into this international stuff, I do not write about what I do to improve my hit count. And I certainly do not do it to get more people to link to me or become a disciple of me or even a groupie of me. Those ideas all scare me in increasing order of fear factor, and&nbsp;I know of at least one person who would have put themselves in each of those categories in the past....</P>
<P>So my titles will continue to stay where they are even though they are not always relevant. Instead they will be based on what I am thinking about when I am writing. Sometimes it will be clever, more often it will be something that I think is clever even though the fact that I have no sense of humor will intrude. And sometimes it will even be relevant to the post.</P>
<P>And if it means that folks like Scoble are less likely to read it, then that is fine. It seems like that is a good way to avoid getting Slashdot coverage, anyway (and if ever there was a list of reasons to <STRONG>not</STRONG> have a blog, that would be two items on the list, maybe three!).</P>
<P>I once had over half a million hits per month on my web site and the only real effect it had on my life was that I could not do as much live updating as I wanted. So I'd rather aim lower from now on.</P>
<P>Sorry Robert, I am not doing this for the hit count. I promise that if you were going to skip it that it was probably not going to be all that&nbsp;interesting anyway. </P>

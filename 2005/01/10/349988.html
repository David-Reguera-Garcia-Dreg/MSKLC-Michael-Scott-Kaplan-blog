<h1>Building sattelite assemblies in the Visual Studio IDE...</h1>

<P>This seemed like a useful tip to share, originally posted in the newsgroup....</P>
<P>The question that was asked:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr>
<P><EM>I've internationalized my product. From most of the reading I've done, it&nbsp;seems that the satellite assemblies need to be built "by hand" and so I'vedone this in the post-build step of my project although this is not very&nbsp;elegant.</EM></P>
<P><EM>However, I notice that when doing a build of any old c# project, the mysterious message "Building satellite assemblies..." gets spit out as&nbsp;partof the build. Does this mean there is some way that Visual Studoi can&nbsp;build the satellite assemblies for me that I am not aware of?</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>And the answer (given by Kai Brinkmann of Microsoft):</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr>
<P><EM>You do not *have* to build your satellite assemblies by hand (using resgen&nbsp;and al). You can, of course, which allows you to modify existing assemblies&nbsp;or add new languages without having to rebuild everything, but the IDE can&nbsp;certainly handle it for you!</EM></P>
<P><EM>All you have to do is add the .resx files for each language to your project.&nbsp;Make sure you follow the proper naming conventions, i.e. &lt;Base&nbsp;Name&gt;.&lt;culture ID&gt;.resx. The language neutral and fallback resources can&nbsp;also be added as &lt;Base Name&gt;.resx. (These resources will be embedded in the&nbsp;main assembly containing your code.) When you build your project, the&nbsp;appropriate satellite assemblies (&lt;Base Name&gt;.resources.dll) will&nbsp;automatically be created in the appropriate directories (culture ID)&nbsp;underneath your output directory (bin/&lt;Configuration&gt;). You'll notice that&nbsp;you won't have access to the .resources files this way (created manually&nbsp;using resgen). They are created at compile time, of course, and then&nbsp;embedded into the DLLs. However, they are not actually saved as separate&nbsp;files.</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Now I did not know that either, but it is pretty cool either way. :-)</P>
<P>Andrew Eames, the guy who asked the original question, also made some observations after getting this cool advice for those who want to try this....</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr>
<P><EM>1) This should really be made clearer in the MSDN help - all of the localization topics in the help lead you towards using resgen and al - I didn't find any reference to the fact you could do this in VS</EM></P>
<P><EM>2) The localized .resx files for controls and forms are not visible in the Solution Explorer unless Show all Files is Checked. Thus if you add a localized .resx file for a form it doesn't look like anything has happened</EM></P>
<P><EM>3) For some odd reason, I had to add my localized files *twice* into the solution before they would appear. The first time, it seemed to go away and do something but the file wasn't added - the second time it actually got added to the solution</EM></P>
<P><EM>4) Selecting multiple .resx files to add in the Add Item dialog didn't seem to work - maybe this is related to 3)</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>I agree completely with #1 -- hopefully this post will do until that happens. #2 is also true (I always have that checked so I did not realize that things were being hidden that way!).</P>

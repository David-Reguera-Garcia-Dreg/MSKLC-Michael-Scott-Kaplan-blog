<P>I am sorry, but for reasons that I cannot explain I seem unable to make a posting about case without involving a pun in the title of the posting. To wit:</P>
<P><A id=CategoryEntryList href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2004/12/02/273619.html">Get off my [lower] case! (or: Casing, the 1st)</A></P>
<P><A id=CategoryEntryList href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2004/12/03/274288.html">The [Upper]Case of the Turkish Ä° (or: Casing, the 2nd)</A></P>
<P><A id=CategoryEntryList href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/01/16/353873.html">How [case-]insensitive (apologies to Frank Sinatra)</A></P>
<P>Now sometimes I come up with good puns, but you would not know if by reading these! All three of them rank among the dumbest I have ever come up with, which is probably saying something.</P>
<P>I'll try to resist the temptation the next time I talk about case....</P>
<P>And truly apologies to Frank Sinatra. His song "How Insensitive" certainly deserves better than this.</P>

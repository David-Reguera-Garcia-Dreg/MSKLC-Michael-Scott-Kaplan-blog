<h1>It's Hungarian-esque</h1>

<P>The other day I was reading <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/earhart/"><U><FONT color=#0000ff>Rob Earhart</U></FONT></A>'s post on <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/earhart/archive/2005/01/05/346949.aspx"><U><FONT color=#0000ff>Hungarian</U></FONT></A> and four things occurred to me:</P>
<P>1) Rob is right about the fact that in the kernel mode code that is not the naming convention they use.</P>
<P>2) I do like Hungarian notation myself. And there are times that I use it.</P>
<P>3) Most of my teammates say that they do not like it.</P>
<P>4) Most of my teammates use it all the time, despite their claims to the contrary.</P>
<P>These last two points are kind of ironic to me....</P>
<P>I remember conversations where I would point out that a pointer to string length would be a <B><I>p</B>cchName</I>, not a <I>cchName</I> and gotten the automatic answer of "oops, you're right" rather than a comment about how awful/ugly Hungarian is. </P>
<P>And I can look in our .NET Framework source code and see how many times <B>dtfi</B> is used for <A title=DateTimeFormatInfo href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfsystemglobalizationdatetimeformatinfoclasstopic.asp" target=_blank>DateTimeFormatInfo</A> objects, <B>nfi</B> is used for <A title=NumberFormatInfo href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfsystemglobalizationnumberformatinfoclasstopic.asp" target=_blank>NumberFormatInfo</A> objects, and <B>ci</B> is used for either <A title=CultureInfo href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfsystemglobalizationcultureinfoclasstopic.asp" target=_blank>CultureInfo</A> or <A title=CompareInfo href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfsystemglobalizationcompareinfoclasstopic.asp" target=_blank>CompareInfo</A> objects (maybe if they spent more time with Hungarian they would have resolved the naming conflict in the <B>ci</B> type abbreviation!). </P>
<P>A lot of Hungarian has disappeared from parameter names in our code just like in the rest of the .NET Framework, but I honestly do not buy the arguments for it (typical argument -- we have Intellisense now!) since I usually do not use Visual Studio as my source code editor (it is not so great for indexing large projects) and it does not help with source code diffs, thus I get no direct benefit from Intellisense. </P>
<P>Lack of Hungarian for me just means more time needed to figure out what stuff <I>is</I>.</P>
<P>Hell, when I owned wizard source code for Microsoft Access, a lot of the new VBA code I wrote there used Hungarian even though VBA had Intellisense because it still did not help in the diff-ing department.</P>
<P>And when you own anything with over 80,000 lines of code (especially code owned by over 10 other developers across five versions of a product!), any trick to make part pf it easier to understand is welcome. And others did a lot of it anyway, with <STRONG>db</STRONG> as a Database and <STRONG>rs</STRONG> as a Recordset, and a zillion <STRONG>cch</STRONG> and <STRONG>ich</STRONG> variables.</P>
<P>With that said, anything can be overused, as Michael Grier pointed out in his <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/earhart/archive/2005/01/05/346949.aspx#347505"><U><FONT color=#0000ff>comment</U></FONT></A> to Rob's post -- some teams, like Office, would require a Hungarian prefix for every type, whether it would make sense or not.</P>
<P>I guess that may make me less popular with the legions that say they prefer to avoid Hungarian notation for their code at all costs. Oh well, I am sure they will get over it, especially since they are probably using it anyway. :-)</P><I><FONT color=#800080>

It's all very well arguing that an object should describe itself by its own structure and not it's name, but you are then relying on a tool to help you work out what an object is.<br><br>( Being a link whore, I wrote about this at <a target="_new" href="http://idunno.org/displayBlog.aspx/2004061901">http://idunno.org/displayBlog.aspx/2004061901</a> )</div>

Basically, he made a distinction between strict and informational notation (he used a better and more self-speaking terminology). <br>My opinion is that a little Hungarian is very helpful as opposed to strict use (ala Office team, according to you) makes it so unreadable that it becomes useless.</div>

<P>As the guy from The Princess Bride said, I do not think that word means what you think it means.... you ever find yourself feeling that way? Localization is one of the words, mainly because people mix up basic terms and assume they mean what other terms mean in this area. But thankfully people like <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/larryosterman/">Larry Osterman</A> not only don't have this problem, but they can point out the people who do, which he proved in his post <A id=viewpost href="http://blogs.msdn.com/larryosterman/archive/2005/01/26/361015.aspx">What <I>is</I> localization anyway?</A> </P>
<P>And no, Larry. You were not stepping on my toes;&nbsp;people saying smart things should never feel like they can't say them. :-)</P>

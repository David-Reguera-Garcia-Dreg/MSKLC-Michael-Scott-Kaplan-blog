<P>I promised I would let people know when I was speaking next....</P>
<P>I will be giving&nbsp;a talk at the .NET Developer's Association on February 14, 2004 in Redmond, WA, USA.&nbsp;I'll be talking about a lot of the exciting globalization features that are new in Whidbey. If you are local (or traveling to Seattle) and interested, you can get more info about the meeting at:&nbsp;</P>

<P>You do have to be a member for the raffle, but anyone can show up for the presentation. <EM>And in case I owe you a book from the raffle that was done the last time I spoke, I will bring them with me!</EM></P>
<P>Now it is Valentine's Day, so if you need me to write a note so your S.O. will understand why you have to be home a little&nbsp;late that night then let me know and I'll see what I can do. (Or you can bring him/her along, though a technical presentation may not be the best Valentine's Day "date" environment.)</P>

Though that was a special circumstance. Maybe a fun story for another day....<br><br>I don't make it to that side of the country as often as I used to. But I used to have a rule that any time I travelled I would offer to speak at the local user's group. I think it started to assuage guilt over my fees but later became a fun thing to do because I like speaking.<br><br>So if I make it there I'll try to scare up a speaking gig. You know what are the good local user groups for .NET around the DC area?</div>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The other day, Andreas Henriksson asked me</FONT></P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT size=2>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr>
<P><EM>I had no idea where to post bug-reports, and you seem to be the author that's why I'm contacting you in person.</EM></P>
<P><EM>I recently bought a new computer with Windows XP x64-edition, since then I've been trying to get my custom keyboard layout working on it. The layout I've previously generated on "regular" XP didn't work (they where claimed to be invalid when switched to), and neighter did installing MSKLC on x64 ("Missing .NET Framework", which if I'm not completely wrong comes preinstalled on x64 as well as 2003 and all newer Windows-versions.).</EM></P>
<P><EM>It would be great if you could comment on it on your blog so I'd know for sure, or even better if the bug could be fixed. :)</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE></FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>When I first got this email, I'll admit I panicked a bit. It ought to work, after all. So I went over to talk to the main tester for MSKLC -- the one talked about when I mentioned that <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/01/04/346116.html">international test is an art (and why there are few fine artists)</A>. 'Kanya,' I asked, 'could this really be happening?' She had never seen a problem like this before, but she gave it a try and had no problems, installing or building the layouts.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Which is not to say there is not a limitation here -- the tool only creates keyboard layouts that sit in an i386 directory for a reason -- if it built IA64 or AMD64 or x64, then it would have directories for the other platform, too. That is definitely something that will have to wait for the next version, sorry!</FONT></P>

I assumed there would be alot of problems with x64 compability but except for this minor incident there has been no problems at all! Thanks for a job well done!<br><br>Regards,<br>Andreas Henriksson<br></div>

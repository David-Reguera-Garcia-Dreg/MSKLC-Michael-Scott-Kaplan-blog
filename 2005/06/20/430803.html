<P><FONT face=Tahoma>You can read all about it in press release info&nbsp;either on the <A href="http://www.sdl.com/company/trados.htm">SDL site</A> or the <A href="http://www.trados.com/press_release.asp?page=1907">TRADOS site</A>.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>This is very cool news, I look forward to what this new entity will be able to bring to localization (and localizability) in the future....</FONT></P>

They are quite direct competition in the TM arena, less choice for translators now. Only that SDL also provides localization services. Now they might even make Trados less affordable to translators not working with them, if they want to. Who knows?<br>But I might be wrong. &quot;Interesting times&quot; anyway :-)</div>

I find it disturbing that a L10n vendor is attempting to corner the tools market.  I first met Mark Lancaster 10 years ago.  He has done a phenomenal job building SDL into the leader that it has become.  Mark is also a ruthless competitor.  I do not see how this move will foster competition in the tools market.  And every L10n company that competes with SDL, has to be very concerned about their access to tools owned by SDL.  Count me amoung the concerned.</div>

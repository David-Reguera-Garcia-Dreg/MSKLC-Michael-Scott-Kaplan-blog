<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The following is a true story. I did omit one of the names to protect myself, though. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I remember a conversation I had&nbsp;several years ago with&nbsp;_<U>ࢁࢁࢁࢁࢁ_ࢁࢁࢁࢁࢁ</U>_ (then just a lowly product manager, now a director -- which I admit makes me feel quite old), just after the midnight eviction (for lack of a better term)&nbsp;when Microsoft left the CompuServe support fora....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><EM>Keep in mind that WAS a case of Microsoft completely dropping one support avenue in favor of another, before Product Support (then known as PSS!) even had tools to work with newsgroups. I was not really important enough then (nor frankly now) to know exactly what happened, but I am sure everyone had their reasons. I honestly do not know if Microsoft "quit or got fired" in that situation....</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Anyway, this guy was going on about how impressed he was at the technical acumen of the customers in the new Microsoft newsgroups, and the fact that that they seemed so much more technically knowledgable than the folks did in the old CIS fora.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I pointed out to him that the reason for the change was almost certainly that many of those longtime customers could not even get online (which was very true, back then), let alone into newsgroups. With only a beta version of 'Athena' (an early Microsoft&nbsp;NNTP&nbsp;reader)&nbsp;as a tool, we were not giving customers a good way to get there. Unless they <EM>were</EM> more sophisticated.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>ࢁࢁࢁࢁࢁ stopped, looked thoughtful, and said "Oh yeah, you may have a point&nbsp;there. We should get&nbsp;the FAQ out right away about how to get to all of the new Microsoft resources online!"</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>"<EM>And where would we put that FAQ?</EM>" I asked, knowing he would fall into the small verbal trap I had just set.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>"On the website!" he exclaimed. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I just looked at him quietly and waited. He did not understand what was making me try so hard not to smile, then suddenly he did. And he looked really embarassed when he realized the non-theoretical problems with posting the "how to get online" FAQ and then putting it online....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Not the most supportable position to be in, is it? :-)</FONT></P>

Since they're usually understaffed, there's always a wait before your call gets answered by an actual person. In the meantime, they will have  a recorded message playing that tells you to check their website. Great... now I was calling you about not being able to get online.<br><br>Another example can be given simply by mentioning a filename: PKUNZIP.ZIP</div>

Kaplan</strong> on 3 Jun 2005 6:31 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">The original premise was someone claiming there was this old group that seems less sophisticted than the new group.<br><br>And I pointed out that reason was that no one knew how to migrate.<br><br>We do not have such a condition today -- there is a web interface to the newsgroups, using CIS means knowing how to use your browser, and everyone who has a computer has a zillion ways to get to the web. <br><br>Now the whole problem could have been solved if he has said &quot;we could post the FAQ on CompuServe in all of those old fora we left.&quot; But I knew that since the default answer was alwys to 'put it on the website' that this would be the quick answer given. :-)</div>

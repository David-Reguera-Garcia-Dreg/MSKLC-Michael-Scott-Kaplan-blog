<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Well, that's not right. Maybe <EM>he</EM> would say "I want my space." No, that's not right either. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>He would say "I&nbsp;want <EM>myspace</EM>". That's it!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>He found it, he actually has a myspace site, right <A href="http://www.myspace.com/michaelpenn">here</A>.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>When someone first pointed it out to me, I was sure it was not him doing the site, himself. Fans do tribute sites all the time like this. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But <A href="http://arubberdoor.blogspot.com/">Spencer Lewis</A>,&nbsp;a man with an inside track on things related to Michael Penn, confirmed it.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I think that is incredibly cool. How many times do famous people actually do their own sites like that? </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Even looking at an official site can be a task that is hard to get to. </FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>I remember when I was down in L.A. and I told Aimee Mann after a Largo show that I had done the international links on her site (her old Bachelor No. 2 site)&nbsp;she looked at me blankly for a second and then said very warmly "Great, thank you!". I am pretty sure she had not seen the links before....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Separate note -- now that the old site I worked on is defunct, maybe I should post the content (some localized biographies, nothing huge) here. It was an interesting localization project to talk about, anyway. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But feel free to check out Michael Penn's myspace.com site. If you have a myspace account you can even claim to be one of Michael Penn's friends!</FONT></P>

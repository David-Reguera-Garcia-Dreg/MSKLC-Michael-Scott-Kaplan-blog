<h1>Is it Macau or is it Macao?</h1>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>People get confused sometimes about the name of this place, but whether you call it:</FONT></P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Haojing'ao (壕鏡澳 "Trench Inlet")</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Liandao (蓮島 "Lotus Island")</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Xiangshan'ao (香山澳 "Fragrant mountain Island")</FONT></LI></UL>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>According to some sites (like the <A href="http://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/macau.html">U.S. Library of Congress</A>), its official name used to be <STRONG>Macao</STRONG> when it was a Portuguese territory but after the reversion to China the official name became <STRONG>Macau (China : Special Administrative Region)</STRONG> and&nbsp;in conversations about it in its former territorial status the name <STRONG>Macau</STRONG> is now prefered in most contexts. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But other sources (such as the <A href="http://www.gov.mo/egi/Portal/index.jsp">Macao SAR Government Portal</A>)&nbsp;seem to prefer <STRONG>Macao</STRONG> and <STRONG>Macao Special Administrative Region</STRONG>.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>At the risk of disrespecting Congress I am going to side with the actual Macao government&nbsp;site, and not just because they have updated more recently. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Last year, while looking into what we had for East Asian collation support in Windows, I noticed a curious fact. The default system code page is 950, which is the Traditional Chinese&nbsp;code page, yet the collation choices were:</FONT></P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>0x00001404 uses the PRC Pinyin-based pronunciation sorting tables<BR>As if it were using MAKELCID(MAKELANGID(LANG_CHINESE, SUBLANG_CHINESE_MACAU), SORT_CHINESE_PRCP)</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>0x00021404 uses the PRC-based stroke order<BR>As if it were using&nbsp;MAKELCID(MAKELANGID(LANG_CHINESE, SUBLANG_CHINESE_MACAU), SORT_CHINESE_PRC)</FONT></LI></UL>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I figured this was a bug but it seemed odd that no one ever reported it, if it were. Hmmm, strange....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So, although I was confused I decided to see if I could find out what was going on. I talked to several native speakers and people now living in the US who were either from Macao or who had vistied there for an extended period, and learned that even though the Traditional forms are still used more often than the Simplified ones, in recent years the Simplified forms have seen more usage. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>More importantly, however, people in Macao often do use&nbsp;a pronunication sort and it is Pinyin-esque (English is a productive language, so I can make that word up!). Many people in Macao learn the Bopomofo pronunciations but they do not use them in their daily lives. Thus the PRC Simplified Pinyin may not be perfect but they will be closer to the order that a native speaker would expect than the Bopomfo order, even if not all of the ideographs are on the list.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I was unable to find any data on a Macao-specific Pinyin ordering, but I do know that the PRC government has expressed interest in getting Pinyin pronunciations for many more ideographs, including Traditional forms. Perhaps one of the motivations behind such a move is indeed to help support people in Hong Kong and Macao! Certainly it is the case that a Pinyin-based IME is more useful to most native speakers in Macao than a Bopomofo one would be.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Maybe something Cantonese would be most useful, but that is a story for another day....</FONT></P>

Or may be what I am asking is whether you've discussed the linguistic effect that Microsoft has -- having that one word where people can't find it can lead to far reaching consequences. Then again, important software should not rely on an OS sort. As computers spread to the remote corners of every country, they naturally impose their own effect on the way business is done there. Finding places where people are familiar with multiple languages and competing ways of organizing text, the default settings on the most common computers and software will become known as the &quot;computer&quot; way of doing things. Then there are aspects of sorting like whether or not to use the word &quot;The&quot; on the beginning of the book title which generally requires an awareness of the issue at the time of data entry. I expect similar issues in other languages, and then the interplay when you are sorting multiple languages. It is a wonderful line of work you do, but this Macao article certainly gives a flavor of a very esoteric aspect. Just some random thoughts...</div>

<p>(if you can read Chinese), it says the reply is official from the Macao government.</p></div>
<p><strong>Michael S.

<p><strong>Alex</strong> on 27 Nov 2007 11:41 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Yes, the author only says his friend claimed to have got an official answer. OTOH, you can see on Macao's official web site that both spelling exists.</p>
<p>Just as much right as when PRC started to spell Peking as Beijing.</p></div>

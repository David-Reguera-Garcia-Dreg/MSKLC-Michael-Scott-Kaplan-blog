<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Ok, yesterday was the day to top all days. Truly. I will remember this one for a while!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Let's see what happened yesterday....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I saw Teresa early on and she mentioned she would be at the Influencer Appreciation Party (more on this later). I also ran into many others I know now, including Gretchen (now in MS-sanctioned clothes, other than the&nbsp;sandals!), Betsy, Julie, Adi, Chris, Michele, and many others. And I finally got to meet <A href="http://www.gregcons.com/kateblog/default.aspx">Kate Gregory</A>! She is yet another awesome person who I have now met in person. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I saw some truly awesome sessions like WEB323 (Overview of ASP.Net 2.0 Part 1), which whetted my appetite for the talk that Michele is doing later today.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Something very funny happened today -- I was not on booth duty until 1:00pm, but I went by there a few times and every time I did there was someone with a question for me. So I just said there was a strange disturbance in the force, sat down, and answered the question(s). It was awesome -- keyboards, SQL Server, more SQL Server, MUI, more SQL Server. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And then I was in the booth and Wes Miller came by and we talked for a bit (I remembered him from when he was a serf). i admitted to how I thought Mark's talk the day before was awesome but that I felt kind of weird going up to him..... so of course the stinker&nbsp;brought him by a little while later! But he is&nbsp;very nice and I told him how good I thought his talk was (he mentioned that he had suggested it be a 300-level talk anyway -- but it was a must-see, as I said earlier!). Wes even mentioned as few non-Unicode bugs that they had to fix in the past, so maybe we have some celebrity converts to the cause of writing Unicode apps and tools and drivers....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Then Michele came to work in the booth too, and her and I talked about Amsterdam, and about exchanging some expertise -- which is&nbsp;really good idea, since I know&nbsp;the&nbsp;fractional value diddly/squat about ASP.NET localization, and it is clear there is a lot there. I will bring my whole collection of knowledge about the BCL stuff about which I know. I also let her know about the following&nbsp;she has (which she&nbsp;refuses to take seriously -- she fails to see that people are amazed by how confident she is and how she is not afraid that people won't take her seriously -- many women are in that boat and it is a wonderful example that competence wins everyone over!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Then an Addison-Wesley AE came by -- Joan Murray (not the religious poet!). She is awesome and we had a great conversation about why I am not writing a book right now and I swear she had me tempted to think about writing another one (either the SQL Internationalization one I was halfway to writing before or other ideas I mentioned to her). We'll see what happens, I am not sure when I would have time to write as book!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So I went back to the hotel, changed into my NSA T-shirt, and then I was at TechEd again to see Julie's Bleeding Edge talk. I had a few not-too-insightful&nbsp;comments, and others had some truly interesting ones. There was one woman who was talking about how frustrating it was to work on areas that had no good docs, and I can totally identify with that one. I hope to talk to her tomorrow or Friday, I have a few additional tips for her -- I would never want someone to be afraid to be an innovator! I'll probably blog about the issue, too....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Okay, so then I scooted over to the </FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>Influencer Appreciation Party, at Metropolis and Matrix. I started in Metropolis but I did not see too many people (and the music was quiet). So I had a few shots with some people I had met ealier and then headed over to Matrix. I saw Teresa there and several others, had a few more drinks, went back to Metropolis where I saw Julie, Kate, Josh, and Gretchen (those who I told how much I had to drink were surprised!). Then I went back to Matrix, saw Teresa on the dance floor and went to tell her something. Next thing you know&nbsp;we were dancing! I was still in the scooter but we danced to Tainted Love with her dancing around me and both of us being weird and fun. Then we danced more and I started moving in the scooter; it was awesome! She said people were taking pictures, I hope they were. If you took pictures of it then let me know, I want copies!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I then got to meet Olga Londer in person in Matrix and we talked for a bit. Another awesome MSFTie who will be in Amsteram, she is a track leader for a conference in Barcelona&nbsp;in November that I might try and speak at. I commented about an interesting point to people then, about how people kept running into the scooter while it was parked, yet they always apologized. I mean, it did not hurt me at all. They will find huge bruises on their legs tomorrow. Yet they apologize to me. What is up with that?</FONT></P><FONT face=Tahoma>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Then I ran into Achim and Scott and we talked for a bit about some techie stuff (licensing questions about Windows, mostly), and then some of them were heading to dinner, but I begged off (on my way to being quite drunk, I was not quite ready to sober up just yet!).</FONT></P>
<P>All mentioin in passing that all night I was able to navigate the crowds and hit no one, on the dancefloor or otherwise. I danced some more with Teresa, and then saw April and Becky dancing and was almost tempted to try to expand my dancing card and decided against it; not everyone would probably be interested in this particulr diversion, and I was starting to wonder if I would just look stupid in the morning when I thought about the dancing thing.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Anyway, at this point, I spent the next few hours going between the two bars and running into people and drinking. By the time the evening was winding down, I had actually had nine drinks (Captain and Sevens) and three shots (Kamikazes), and then I had one more with Gretchen before I finally said goodnight to the ones still there and headed back to the hotel.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I note in passing that there is no law against scooting while under the influence. But I made it back without incident, checked some mail, wrote this blog entry, and had some Limonata (need to avoid that hangover tomorrow!).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I do not want to minimize the awesome conversations I had today, they were awesome. But the party was fun too, and I do not remember having this much fun since nearly two years ago at my sister's wedding when someone danced with me all night (and I was able to stand!). Hard to top that, but doing the best I could, it was still&nbsp;a lot of fun and I will treasure the time. Teresa, I owe you one....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Anyway, I have a technical post to write so I will wrap this one up. Tomorrow will be another day!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/betsya/">Betsy Aoki</A> pointed out that she was going to be <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/betsya/archive/2005/06/02/424651.aspx">black and blue at TechEd Orlando</A>, and I realized that I would be, too.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>This is referring to the colors we'll be wearing, the blue shirts we'll both have (though I think my shirt will be dark and hers will be light, since I'm a speaker and she is staff? Maybe I read the mail wrong).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I know that I certainly won't be a booth babe. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Maybe I will be a lounge lizard. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Or a cabana clown. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Whatever. But here is my staff/speaking schedule:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And the rest of the time I will be attending other people's sessions or BOFs or GrokTalks or hooking up with people I know for a drink or dinner or whatever.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I know that Wes will be there, and Scott will be speaking about Code Generation (<STRONG>ARC305</STRONG>) -- I have to be&nbsp;a clinic clown then or I'd attend!. And Mary will be there on staff, just like Betsy. And Andy will&nbsp;be speaking with Tim about Access 2003&nbsp;(<STRONG>PRT311</STRONG>) -- I am working then, too -- but I can catch the last half of that talk, at least. And Stephen and Richard are both&nbsp;speaking about Transact SQL (<STRONG>DBA304</STRONG>) but are actually head to head with me so I will have to pretend we are enemies or something (I'll figure out how to do that with people who I have walked the streets of Amsterdam with, somehow). And I also managed to miss Richard's other talk too about SQL Profiler (<STRONG>DAT383</STRONG>)&nbsp;-- man, I am batting zero here!&nbsp;And there is Ken speaking about VSTO (<STRONG>CLI361</STRONG>), but I miss that one, too. And Michele is gonna be there -- I miss her first talk on Web Services Security (<STRONG>CSI349</STRONG>)&nbsp;but I didn't need to see that one. Her second talk on Going Global with ASP.Net though (<STRONG>WEB326</STRONG>), I&nbsp;am definitely interested in -- and I am free then. Cool. Unfortunately, I miss both of Kate's talks about Visual C++ (<STRONG>DEV330</STRONG> and <STRONG>DEV331</STRONG>), which sucks a little -- I will try to say hi to her later since we have not actually met yet in person. And Aaron is speaking -- his session on least privilege (<STRONG>SEC350</STRONG>) has been in my list for a while and I am free for that one, too. I am not free for Matt and Achim's talk about custom cultures (<STRONG>DEV323</STRONG>) but I wrote the code for many of the features they are going to talk about (and even helped to <FONT color=#808080><STRIKE>tear apart</STRIKE></FONT>review their slides), so thats okay :-). And the fair Teresa will be there on staff - she hates when I call her Tracy so I'll try to resist the temptation since that is just not how vice presidents&nbsp;are supposed to&nbsp;behave with Madame President. And I am free for Andrew's talk on WinForm's&nbsp;Data Binding (<STRONG>CLI322</STRONG>) -- also very cool -- snf my second talk builds on some part of this one a little bit. I am head to head up against Houman and Russ and their Global Release Planning talk (<STRONG>ARC303</STRONG>), so I'll have to look at the slides later. I will definitely be at Julie's BoF about Life on the Bleeding Edge (<STRONG>BOF031</STRONG>) -- wanna know my secret, Julie? I never sleep! I might have tried to attend her other BOF about women who code (<STRONG>BOF016</STRONG>) if they would have let me in. Mainly I am curious&nbsp;about the issue&nbsp;but then I work in a group at Microsoft that has more women then some divisions seem to have, so my view may be skewed on that subject. But I get to see what is the most important (to me) of Kimberly's <EM>four</EM> talks, the one on Index Usage and Best Practices (<STRONG>DBA305</STRONG>) -- most important because I get to build on it with my second session a few days later!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Ok, thats enough. I am out of breath now. Time to go do some actual work for a bit....</FONT></P>
<P><EM><FONT color=#ff0000>UPDATE 26 June 2005 -- I realized after I had posted this that not everyone had the context of my comments about Matt and Achim's DEV323 session. I was the original author of a lot of the features that they were presenting about, and as such was heavily involved with a lof the planning, and spent a lof time wanting to make sure that everything was being covered that I would ideally want to see covered. I did not truly "tear apart" anything as much as suggest more things to cover!</FONT></EM></P>

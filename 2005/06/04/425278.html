<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I made it, finally. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Boy, people in airports never watch where they are going or listen when people are saying things to or yelling at them, either. It was the only tiring part of the trip (other than the couple sitting next to me who had defective kidneys or something -- I should have offered to take the window rather than having to keep getting up....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So I talked to Teresa a few minutes ago but she is going to bed soon (she has a 12 HOUR training session tomorrow!). She was worried we wouldn't see each other. But I pointed out that I had posted <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/06/03/424691.html">exactly where I will be for 25 hours between Tuesday and Friday</A>, and hinted at where I was going to try and be for a lot of the rest of it. Anyone who cannot find me is not trying very hard!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But I brought my case of Limonata (the space it took up in the bag can be filled with swag from the week!), a digital camera, and a laptop. I'm ready for whatever is supposed to happen next.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>If&nbsp;you are at TechEd then pop by the Dr. International Clinic and say hi! :-)</FONT></P>

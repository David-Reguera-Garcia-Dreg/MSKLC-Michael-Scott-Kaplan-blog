<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Back in the beginning of May, I posted about <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/05/05/414933.html"><STRONG>Community Server issues that seem affect this blog</STRONG></A>.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Looks like they have been busy fixing some bugs!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Bugs #2 and #3 no longer seem to happen -- there appears to be full access via both the month links and the category links, all the way back to my original posts as far back&nbsp;as&nbsp;November of last year.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Bug #1 (searches&nbsp;unable to look past page #1) still happens, though it is slightly different now:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Search </FONT><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/"><FONT face=Tahoma>http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/</FONT></A><FONT face=Tahoma> for a word that is there a lot, like collation. It is now up to 57 hits (but after all, the name of the freaking blog is "Sorting It All Out"; what did you expect?).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Page 1 has this link:</FONT></P>
<P><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/search.aspx?q=collation&amp;p=1"><FONT face=Tahoma>http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/search.aspx?q=collation&amp;p=1</FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>There are four link pages at the bottom. The links for 2, 3, 4 look like this:</FONT></P>
<P><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/blogsearch.aspx?App=michkap&amp;q=collation&amp;p=1&amp;PageIndex=2"><FONT face=Tahoma>http://blogs.msdn.com/blogsearch.aspx?App=michkap&amp;q=collation&amp;p=1&amp;PageIndex=2</FONT></A><BR><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/blogsearch.aspx?App=michkap&amp;q=collation&amp;p=1&amp;PageIndex=3"><FONT face=Tahoma>http://blogs.msdn.com/blogsearch.aspx?App=michkap&amp;q=collation&amp;p=1&amp;PageIndex=3</FONT></A><BR><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/blogsearch.aspx?App=michkap&amp;q=collation&amp;p=1&amp;PageIndex=4"><FONT face=Tahoma>http://blogs.msdn.com/blogsearch.aspx?App=michkap&amp;q=collation&amp;p=1&amp;PageIndex=4</FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>all of which still point content-wise to page 1. If you instead use</FONT></P>
<P><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/search.aspx?q=collation&amp;p=2"><FONT face=Tahoma>http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/search.aspx?q=collation&amp;p=2</FONT></A><BR><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/search.aspx?q=collation&amp;p=3"><FONT face=Tahoma>http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/search.aspx?q=collation&amp;p=3</FONT></A><BR><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/search.aspx?q=collation&amp;p=4"><FONT face=Tahoma>http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/search.aspx?q=collation&amp;p=4</FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>then everything works. The PageIndex stuff looks like a no-op.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>On the brighter side, the bug with the comment counting that I talked about in <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/04/14/408239.html"><STRONG>Comments work here (though not so you'd really notice or anything)</STRONG></A>&nbsp;seems to be getting better. Old posts with bad counts did not have their counts spontaneously updated, but new anonymous comments seem to be counted. If it is true, the counts will slowly start to get more accurate.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Someone has been busy fixing stuff. Awesome work, mostly, and that is more than good enough for me....</FONT></P>

This was, at the time, misrendered as Date&amp;amp;Time.<br><br>So I whined via the MSDN Contact Us link that the subjects were being doubly HtmlEncoded.<br><br>Less than a day later I got an email back that it was fixed (!)  Sure enough, the subject was rendered as Date&amp;Time.  I was impressed.<br><br>Then, Larry did another post - this one with &quot;\&quot; in the subject (including the quotes.)  This one was rendered as &amp;quot;\&amp;quot;<br><br>After I stopped laughing I realized what had happened.<br><br>There's probably a line that looks like this...<br><br>lbl.Text = HtmlEncode(s); // no need for HtmlEncode<br><br>Instead of changing it to<br>lbl.Text = s; // lbl auto-HtmlEncodes<br><br>they had changed it to<br>lbl.Text = HtmlEncode(s).Replace(&quot;&amp;amp;&quot;, &quot;&amp;&quot;); // see bug report by Maurits<br><br>Made my day. :)</div>
<p><a id="433841" href="#433841">#</a> <strong>Maurits [MSFT]</strong> on 29 Jun 2005 11:56 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Now that I check Larry's blog today, though, it looks like all the HtmlEncoding is working well.</div>
<p><a id="433849" href="#433849">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 29 Jun 2005 12:13 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">I have had several posts with that problem (I got in the habit of using ' rather than &quot; to keep it from happening to me). Cool if it is fixed, too (though it did not really bite me too much, so I did not worry much &lt;grin&gt;).</div>
<p><a id="434180" href="#434180">#</a> <strong>Sushant Bhatia</strong> on 30 Jun 2005 5:54 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Community Server is a nice ASP.NET blog/portal solution but its just ridiculously buggy and featureless. I'm currently running one on my home server and its just a pain to manage.<br><br>I'm actually planning on moving to Plone/Zope which is so much nicer. Its a Content Management System with the ability to do things like Blogs/Gallery/Forum/Podcasting/Media etc etc. And comments work on there :-)<br><br>Believe it or not, Plone/Zope is used by some VERY high faluting companies and organizations like NATO, and some non-profit orgs.<br><br>Anyways, I'm just saying there are alternatives if you think you can't take it anymore :-)</div>
<p><a id="434213" href="#434213">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 30 Jun 2005 10:28 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">I am nowhere near *that* point, and on the whole I am pretty happy. I have a nice base here and several hundred posts that I would hate to have to &quot;lose&quot; in a move.... so I'll probably stay where I am. :-)</div>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The story today is about a character that has not been encoded in Unicode as of yet. In fact, it was brought to the Unicode Technical Committee (UTC) once already and been turned down. but it had enough of a history behind it that I thought it might be worth having a story told....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It all started with some great work from the <FONT face=TimesNewRomanPSMT>Council for Information Technology (CINTEC), the Information and Communication Technology Agency of Sri Lanka (ICTA), and others&nbsp;on a document entitled <FONT face=TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT><STRONG>SRI LANKA STANDARD SINHALA CHARACTER CODE FOR INFORMATION INTERCHNAGE</STRONG>. The second version of the document that we saw was submitted to the UTC at the 99th UTC meeting, held in Toronto on <A href="http://www.unicode.org/consortium/utc-minutes/UTC-099-200406.html">June 15-18, 2004</A>. The document was very well put together.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPSMT><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT>If I recall, the only real point of contention that came up was a description in the document of how to handle a vowel sign (which is a combining character) without a preceeding consonant (to act as a base):</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr>
<P align=left><FONT face=Tahoma size=2><EM>A vowel sign without an associated consonant may be displayed by preceding it with a </EM></FONT><FONT face=Tahoma size=2><EM>zero-width non-joiner (zwnj) character. e.g. ා = 200C 0DCF (zwnj + ා).</EM></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPSMT><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT>Subsequently there were several examples given doing this. There were several people who did not like this idea, as it really did not fit with the conventional usage of the&nbsp; <A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/200c/index.htm">U+200c</A> (ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER).</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPSMT><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT>This is obviously not a new requirement; for as long as there have been combining characters, there has been a need to describe how to display them when no base character was present. There have always been two Unicode code points that have been recommended for this purpose:</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPSMT><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT><A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0020/index.htm">U+0020</A> (SPACE)</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma><A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/00a0/index.htm">U+00a0</A> (NO-BREAK SPACE)</FONT></LI></UL>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPSMT><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT>However, for some time the SPACE has been a problematic choice here, due to the way standards such as HTML allow the removal of spaces preceeding or following text, and it was a huge burden on formatters and parsers to have to handle this scenario and finding a SPACE character that was being used as a base&nbsp;character to not be extraneous....</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPSMT><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT>So the feedback was set to be given to the Sri Lankan NB to commend them for the excellent proposal with one suggested change -- to use <A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/00a0/index.htm">U+00a0</A> rather than <A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/200c/index.htm">U+200c</A> to work as the base.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPSMT><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT>The thorny issue of what to do with <A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0020/index.htm">U+0020</A>&nbsp;was talked about for a bit -- clearly some text would have to drafted explaining that while in some situations it represents a reaonable&nbsp;choice, in others it was a real problemtic one due to the spaces being removed, and then we moved on to other issues.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPSMT><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT>And then, on the way to the WG2 meeting, Michael Everson, after consulting with Peter Constable, Rick McGowan, and Ken Whistler, put together a document.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPSMT><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT>The name? <B><A href="http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n2822.pdf"><FONT face=Times-Bold>Proposal to add </FONT><FONT face=Times-Bold size=1><FONT size=3>INVISIBLE LETTER</FONT> </FONT><FONT face=Times-Bold>to the UCS</B></FONT></A>.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPSMT><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT>The idea was a dedicated code point to act as an invisible base character for precisely this situation. And there was some even some art, provided by Mr. Everson:</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPSMT><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT><IMG height=74 src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/invisible01.jpg" width=577></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPSMT><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT>What is that smudge in the middle of the invisible whatever? Hmmm, lets look at 200%.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPSMT><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/invisible02.jpg"></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPSMT><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT>Hmmmm. Still can't make it out. But it does look like more than a smudge. Let's take a look at 400%.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPSMT><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/invisible03.jpg"></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPSMT><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT>Clearly text saying something. My eyesight is 20/20 OS and 20/25 OD, but maybe I am just tired. Let's blow it up to 800% and see what this says.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPSMT><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT><IMG src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/invisible04.jpg"></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPSMT><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT>Geez Mr. Everson, I guess you really are a geek! I'm not sure I would have immortalized it in a proposal (or if I did I probably would not say anything until it was too late).</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPSMT><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT>Anyway, it went to WG2 as an FYI (I was not there, but I heard that Mr. Everson had hinted that the text said something and the chair (Mr. Mike Ksar)&nbsp;did what I did and blew up the image on the overhead. He was not amused at the time. 2 x :-)</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPSMT><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT>At the next UTC meeting (#100) in Redmond, WA on <A href="http://www.unicode.org/consortium/utc-minutes/UTC-100-200408.html">August 10-13</A>, the proposal was reviewed and the decision was made to make it a Public Review Issue (PRI), <A href="http://www.unicode.org/review/resolved-pri.html#pri41">#41</A>. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPSMT><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT>Then at the next UTC meeting (#101) in Cupertino, CA on <A href="http://www.unicode.org/consortium/utc-minutes/UTC-101-200411.html">November 15-18</A>,&nbsp;a motion to accept the encoding of INVISIBLE LETTER failed (3 for, 6 against, and 1.5 abstained). </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPSMT><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT>And then, the next motion, to add the INVISIBLE LETTER to the list of rejected characters, also failed (5 for, 0.5 against, 5 abstained). </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPSMT><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT>I won't comment on that set of votes other than to note that most decisions these days in the UTC are actually passed by consensus, not via a motion and a vote (for example at that meeting there were 37 consensus decisions and 7 motions). This was a pretty amazingly contentious issue! Maybe we were all blowing off some steam? :-)</FONT></FONT></FONT></P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPSMT><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPSMT><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT>Personally, I would have rather it had been a small Invisible Jet, instead. Ms. Bennett has long pined for a Wonder Woman analogue for ✈&nbsp;(U+2708, a.k.a. AIRPLANE). What better location for an invisible jet than hidden in an invisible letter?</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Or we could just go back to the actual work....</P>
<P>So, worthy of a story, right? :-)</P>

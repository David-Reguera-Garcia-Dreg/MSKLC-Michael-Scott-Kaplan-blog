<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Another very cool day at TechEd -- especially because I saw <A href="http://www.dasblonde.net/">Michele Leroux Bustamante</A>'s session WEB326 (ASP.NET 2.0: Going Global Gets Easier! New Localization Features in ASP.NET 2.0). This is an area which I tragically knew very little about, and it was wonderful to turn that around and start learning about the improvements to the model. Thanks, Michele!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I spent a lot of the rest of the day in the Dr. International Clinic, which was reasonably quiet (though I did get one person asking me the very question <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/06/09/427293.html">I was busily writing an answer to</A>&nbsp;-- I told him the answer briefly and let him know if he looked within the next 30 minutes to my blog that the&nbsp; detailed answer would be up!). He came back later after reading it to say thanks -- he doubted it would be in the docs and was very happy that it was <EM>somewhere</EM> where people could find it! :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>There are a lot of people who are interested in SQLCLR integration, and this was a data point that had either frustrated them or that once they heard about it realized might frustrate them later. So I will probably post more on it another day. And when I said in that post about how there is "<EM>definitely room for people to improve the experience here in future releases!</EM>" I include myself in that <STRONG>people</STRONG> category -- I am the owner of one of the pieces of that puzzle (the CompareInfo piece) and just like with our work in the <A href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/eaw6y1cb(en-us,vs.80).aspx">GetCultureInfo method</A>&nbsp;there will have to be people working on both sides to help make the integration that much tighter in the future....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But the hardest part of smoothing that integration pathway is knowing where all the potholes are. So as you find them, let <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap">me</A> know or let <A href="http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/productfeedback/">us</A> know (or both!) so that the road can be made that much smoother!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Anyway, a few other customer contacts, including several fascinating ones about the changing face of documentation -- I will be posting about this one another day.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I did not go to the party last night -- sorry folks. I had to get some work done and it was raining and I did party the night before. I am sure everyone had a great time. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Onward to Day 5!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Scott figured it out, and it was not a Microsoft bug.:-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>You can read about the details on Scott's blog at <A href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/UpdateOnTheDasBlogTurkishIBugAndAReminderToMeOnGlobalization.aspx">Update on the dasBlog Turkish-I bug and a reminder to me on Globalization</A>.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Now I have talked about the Turkish I issue in general before (cf: <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2004/12/03/274288.html">The [Upper]Case of the Turkish İ (or: Casing, the 2nd)</A>), but I will post some more on this soon. But Scott's object lesson here is even cooler -- you can see how easy it is for internationalization issues can bite you if you are not very careful....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Thought FWIW -- Scott, do not feel too bad. Microsoft has had to fix many such bugs in the past. One of the biggest reasons for Microsoft to produce documents like <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/06/02/424128.html">the New String Recommendations</A>&nbsp;is because even internally people were having problems, and MS wanted to have some solid guidelines to help people avoid those issues (and thus not have bugs!).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It is a tester's dream&nbsp;-- they can always find issues in an area like this!</FONT></P>

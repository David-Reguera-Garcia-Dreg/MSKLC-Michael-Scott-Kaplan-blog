<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Three new entries in the list of the <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2004/12/18/325156.html">Blogs I Read</A>, given here in in the order I have added them. :-)</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><A href="http://abecedaria.blogspot.com/">ABECEDARIA</A> (A blog about keyboarding in diverse scripts, literacy and digital literacy, and the history of writing system theory.)</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr>
<P><FONT size=2>Suzanne E. McCarthy has just started up a blog and commented on some of what is here in this blog. Looking at her subtitle she is casting a very wide net, but her posts thus far certainly do seem to indicate this is not over-reaching. I may be crazy here, but I think she talks like maybe she is a linguist! She has some excellent&nbsp;posts about children learning on computers about input methods before they could even read and general points about more intelligent input systems, posts that can make any reasonable person (or even someone like me!) question whether the model for some of the keyboards that are used is as intuitive as it could be. Anyway, I am going to keep an eye on this one and perhaps find out more about what she does and where -- what brings people into any aspect of globalization is something I always find facinating....</FONT></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jobsblog/default.aspx">Technical Careers @ Microsoft</A> (with Gretchen, your friendly recruiting ambassador)</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT size=2>This is Gretchen Ledgard's blog, with a lot of good recruiting info in it (plus other random goodies). I actually got to meet Gretchen yesterday here at TechEd 2005 in Orlando, and she told me something that blew me away. She said she was&nbsp;a fan of this blog! She has long been one of the blogs I picked up via new posts on </FONT><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/"><FONT size=2>MSDN Blogs</FONT></A><FONT size=2>&nbsp;from even back when it was Zoë and Gretchen, but something about that particular statement floored me. People have done it before by talking about opinions they formed before&nbsp;they ever even met me, with such statements&nbsp;about my presence on technical forums in CompuServe (e.g. my former occasional co-author Lynn Caldwell neé Shanklin) and&nbsp;in technical newsgroups (e.g. my favorite MVP "groupie" Nancy Mahaffey). The thought of someone being a fan of my online persona is interesting to me, for reasons I cannot identify. As always, I will try not to disappoint!</FONT></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><A class=headermaintitle href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jledgard/default.aspx">scooblog by josh ledgard</A> (program manager | "community stick-wielder" | devdiv)</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT size=2>I am truly a disciple of Gretchen's husband Josh Ledgard and his blog, which has allowed me to shape the way <EM>my</EM> blog looks and feels.&nbsp;By doing all of the spluenking into customizations of .Text and then Community Server, he is truly my CSS Rosetta Stone. You know how sometimes you wait until someone has cleared the snow before you go out into it? That is the relationship I have with Josh (well, the one my blog has with his blog, you know what&nbsp;I mean). I also met Josh yesterday here at TechEd 2005 in Orlando, and that was very cool (he helped me figure out how to get invited places!).&nbsp;It was about time to not just follow him via </FONT><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/"><FONT size=2>MSDN Blogs</FONT></A><FONT size=2>&nbsp;and to just start picking up his RSS directly....</FONT></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT face=Tahoma>
<P>And then there is my niece, who is now nine months old. Her dad really needs to teach her how to put in an RSS feed! And my sister-out-law, who also ought to put one in.</FONT></P>

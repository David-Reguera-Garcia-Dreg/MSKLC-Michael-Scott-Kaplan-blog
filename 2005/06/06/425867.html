<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Day 1 of TechEd was an interesting one. I had some good conversations in the cabana (including a few people who read about it here).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Also,&nbsp;I did my first talk (DAT290). It was very under-attended, which I think threw me a little as I had people telling me that there was some huge reversal with 170 people signing up for it and an estimated 330 people expected to show up. The actual numbers were nothing like that, of course. I think I will ignore size suggestions based on either the early estimates or the later ones based on schedule since neither one appears to be very accurate....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>My second talk is a last day of the conference, last session of the day talk. Which is of course when everyone's head is about to burst from information -- generally not the time to blow anyone's mind, right? I'll figure out something clever here, since there are some mind-blowing things to cover, I think!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Lots of cool stuff going on tomorrow, including Julie's Bleeding Edge BoF and a few other "can't miss" talks during the day. I'm heading out to the Bloggers dinner soon, which should be fun -- I'll post when I make it back....:-)</FONT></P>

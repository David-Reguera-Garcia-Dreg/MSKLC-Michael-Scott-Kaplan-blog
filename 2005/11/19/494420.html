<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I figured I knew English pretty well. At least once I was no longer under the anal-retentive authority of the prescriptive linguists, I mean.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Every time I spend some time in Ireland (or Australia, or the UK, etc.), I remember that it is not about knowing the English language; it is about the dialect of English. You know, the slang.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I bought that cellular phone and it was now almost out of minutes. I needed to get some more minutes added, or I was in trouble.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So I innocently ask Magda, the young girl at the front desk, where I could buy some more minutes for my cell.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>She looked at me, confused.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>"You want to top off your mobile?" she asked, clearly having trouble divining the meaning of my words.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Now as I said before,&nbsp;I do love the accent, but there are times that it confuses what is said, at least to my ears!&nbsp;And "top off" is a common slang term in the USA for what you do when you are filling up the tank of a car with gasoline.&nbsp;And some people will call a car a mobile, like as in [auto]mobile. So when she said "top up" I thought she was saying "top off" and I figured she was asking me if I meant I wanted to fill up as car's gas tank.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>We both starred at each other for a moment, the realization we each had was that whatever the other was saying was&nbsp;lost on the other.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Anyway,&nbsp;we finally figured it out and I now knew I had to ask where to top up my&nbsp;mobile. I got there and took care of it, so all was now goodness.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Now if only I could remember&nbsp;the number of my mobile? :-)</FONT></P>

<p><a id="494974" href="#494974">#</a> <strong>Jonathan</strong> on 20 Nov 2005 5:16 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">In Hebrew, a cellular phone is commonly called פלאפון(Pelephone), which literally means &quot;wonder-phone&quot;. It's named after the first company that offered that service in Israel, but many people call that even to other companies phones (&quot;I just bought a Pelephone from Orange&quot;). It's like the Americans that say &quot;Xerox machine&quot; for any photocopier, whether made by Xerox or not (also Kleenex, Frigidaire, etc).<br><br>But, some people just say נייד(Nayad), which literlly means &quot;mobile&quot;.</div>

Hunter</strong> on 20 Nov 2005 2:33 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Having met a Londoner at the MVP Summit who is fast becoming one of my favourite people in the world, I have also recently determined that Americans and Britons speak the same language in only the broadest of terms.  :-)</div>
<p><a id="495048" href="#495048">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 20 Nov 2005 3:49 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Darn Laura, I thought I (as the only person in the universe who could convince you to stay and break bread after the MVP Summit!) was your favourite person in the world....<br><br>But I agree with the rest of what you have said. :-)</div>
<p><a id="495198" href="#495198">#</a> <strong>Richard Gadsden</strong> on 21 Nov 2005 5:51 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">You might have noticed that she said &quot;mobile&quot; rather than &quot;cell&quot; for the phone too.<br><br>The en-gb and en-ie localisations - even though they are two very large markets for Microsoft, and you employ lots and lots of people in those locations - are very much under-developed in Microsoft products generally.<br><br>Any chance of IE7 having &quot;Favourites&quot; in en-gb and en-ie localisations - maybe even only on Vista?<br><br>Any chance of C:\Programme Files? and Start/Programmes?<br><br>And there's en-au, en-nz and en-ca to look at too!</div>
<p><a id="495237" href="#495237">#</a> <strong>Oliver Lippold</strong> on 21 Nov 2005 9:31 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Are you sure she said &quot;top off&quot; and not &quot;top up&quot;? The latter is what we say in the UK. Though if topping off with gas is a genuine phrase, you're probably right, as we would top up with petrol. <br><br>I may be biased, but I think &quot;mobile phone&quot; is a much more understandable name than &quot;cell phone&quot;. A phone is mobile because you can take it with you, whereas I had no idea what &quot;cell&quot; actually meant, until I looked it up on Wikipedia 5 minutes ago. (And interestingly, I searched for &quot;cell phone&quot; and got redirected to &quot;mobile phone&quot;)</div>
<p><a id="495244" href="#495244">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 21 Nov 2005 9:55 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">She *did* say &quot;top up&quot; -- I just thought it must have been &quot;top off&quot; since I had no idea what she meant....<br><br>Any time we think our own slang is more understandable we are showing our bias. :-)</div>
<p><a id="495275" href="#495275">#</a> <strong>Eric Lippert</strong> on 21 Nov 2005 11:43 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Could have been worse.  <br><br>I was visiting a fellow Canadian in Northern Ireland once and she made the mistake of telling her Irish roommate that I &quot;gave her a ride all the way home from Portrush&quot;.  Apparently that means something _naughty_ in Ireland.</div>
<p><a id="495319" href="#495319">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 21 Nov 2005 12:50 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Hi Eric,<br><br>You are correct, that would have been worse. I embarrass fairly easily and that would have been more than enough to do the trick.<br><br>I will definitely not talk about having someone give me a ride to the airport when I leave!</div>
<p><a id="495406" href="#495406">#</a> <strong>Nick Lamb</strong> on 21 Nov 2005 4:16 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Everything means &quot;something naughty&quot; in English. That's the whole point of things like the Fast Show's &quot;Suits you!&quot; tailors, seaside postcards or the Carry On films. There's no clear point where their lines change from apparently unfortunate choices of phrase into outright filth. You can have a perfectly normal conversation, every single sentence of which might reasonably be construed as obscene, illegal or offensive.<br><br>How many children have smirked at the name &quot;Microsoft&quot;, do you think Michael? I've often wondered, being at best passable in foreign languges and certainly a long way from fluent, how often this &quot;mock confusion&quot; is also the case with alleged foreign marketing problems. Are the Chinese stupid enough to think the product is &quot;Bite the wax tadpole&quot;? No, Coca-Cola's reasons for wanting better Chinese branding were sound, but there was never any /confusion/ everyone already knew what was in the cans.<br><br>I guess my message is, context is everything. Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.</div>
<p><a id="495431" href="#495431">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 21 Nov 2005 5:02 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Nick, it is entirely obtuse to equate marketing campaigns with casual conversations where it is quite easy to say something that is heard as being a lot more &quot;naughty&quot; than was intended.<br><br>I am talking about every day conversations here, as was Eric.</div>
<p><a id="5423069" href="#5423069">#</a> <strong>An Englishman in Denver</strong> on 12 Oct 2007 10:24 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em"><p>Yes, you have to be careful with English and American language confusion. I'm a British software developer, and a few years ago I had cause to be in the States working on a project. It was the first time I'd been there and I had not figured out the differences completely. I was in the office with a group of other (American) developers, and someone came up to us and asked where another of our co-workers was. Without thinking, as the phrase is perfectly innocent in the UK, I said &quot;he's smoking a fag outside&quot;. Cue astonished looks and laughter. I didn't realise what I'd said for about 20 seconds, upon realisation I buried my face in my hands and wished the ground to open up and swallow me.</p></div>

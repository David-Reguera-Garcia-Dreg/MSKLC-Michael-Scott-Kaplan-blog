<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Well, today was day #1 of the <A href="http://www.unicode.org/consortium/utc.html">Unicode Technical Committee</A> meeting.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>By the way -- why doesn't the Unicode Consortium have a blog? They could call it UniBlog!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It would like 470 BC, when much of the world looked like the cover of the Led Zepplin album "Houses of the Holy". There would be many steps and columns, it would be most tranquil.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Oh wait, that is Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Anyway, a Unicode RSS feed would be nice to have, if we could not convince folks to make a Unicode blog, at least.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Ok, back to the UTC meeting.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>This meeting takes place four times a year, although since this is the 105th meeting and the <A href="http://www.unicode.org/">Unicode Consortium</A> has not been around for 26.5 years, it must hsve previously met more often. I am not sure why this never occurred to me before, I just sort of used the number subconsciously and never thought about it. Oh well, in any case, today was the first day of the meeting.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>We started a little later today, something we always do so that people have time to get here on early morning flight. Seems a bit useless to me since&nbsp;if it is no impossible&nbsp;to get to San Jose by 10:30am on on a Tuesday from out of town then it is as at least pretty&nbsp;improbable. But no worries, I came in the day before.... :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Today is a meeting of the script subcommittee, which is a really cool day since it is a focused attempt to take the "script" topics like new characters and new scripts and get them done first. This is a lot better than randomly interspersing the topics throughout the week, in my opinion (and obviously in the opinion of the people who thought of it).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Very cool all the way around.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Though I do think the subcommittee thing, where all recommendations it makes must be approved in plenary (which is the same people, a day or three later), feels a little unwieldy. Though it does save us from having to vote until later, so it probably just feels that way -- in reality it is likely to be much more efficient....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I am not sure what the rules are about talking about the meeting before the minutes are published (and the UTC in plenary can always not accept a script subcommittee meeting, just as anyone can reconsider a decision at the moment of truth) but I thought I'd give a quick smattering of topics....</FONT></P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Malayalam Chilus (one of those 'lots of heat but not very much light' issues in the user community, right now!)</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Malayalam Fractions</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Malayalam Zero (a Proposed Glyph Correction)</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Egyptian Transliteration Characters</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Egyptian Hieroglyphics (I don't expect the Ancient Egyptian&nbsp;locale on Windows anytime soon, but there are always custom locales for anyone who can figure out the date formats!)</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Ol Chiki Script</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Mahjong Symbols (I could probably send my mom, a long time Mahjong player, to the WG2 meeting to talk to the Taiwan reps. about these!)</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Tibetan Astrological Symbols (brings up the eternal question -- is it good luck or bad luck to encode the bad luck character?)</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Arabic Script Math</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Arabic Script Hamzas</FONT></LI></UL>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>and lots more.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It was a busy day, and everyone seems in good spirits.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Our host (Adobe) may have lots to do with that -- the space we are meeting in seems to be working quite well and everyone has connectivity and the Adobe cafeteria is nearby. If you work at Adobe, we're in the Albertus Room, feel free to stop by&nbsp;before 9:30 and say hi (I come in early each day so I'll be around!).</FONT></P>

<h1>The Software Tester's Axioms</h1>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Like any science (and please do not for a moment doubt that <STRONG>Test</STRONG> is an engineering discipline, and at heart a good engineer is an applied scientist!), software testing has some basic principles which cannot be proven but are simply universal truths upon which other theorems can be based.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><EM>(The original version of these was put up years ago by me in a newsgroup, but after many reformulations, the current ones have stayed stable for some time. There have been other corollaries and theorems proposed but I have not captured all of them here)</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Here are the Tester's axioms:</FONT></P><FONT face=Tahoma>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=4><STRONG>Axiom I: If you have not tested it, assume it is broken.</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=4><STRONG>Axiom II: If someone changes it, they probably broke it.</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=4><STRONG>Axiom III: Sometimes when it is not changed, it&nbsp;breaks too.</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=4><STRONG>Axiom IV: What is broken&nbsp;on the test machine often works fine on the dev machine.</STRONG> </FONT></P></FONT>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><STRONG><FONT size=4>Axiom V:There is always another bug that a user can find. </FONT></STRONG></FONT></P><FONT face=Tahoma>
<P>And there is of course the&nbsp;first theorem of test, which is largely based on applying on the developer's doubt of Axioms 2, 3, and 5&nbsp;created by the circumstances of&nbsp;Axiom 4: 
<P><STRONG><FONT size=4>THEOREM I: Developers will often not believe&nbsp;there is a bug&nbsp;until it is proven to them, sometimes&nbsp;with extreme prejudice. </FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>And of course the corollary to Axiom V:</P>
<P><STRONG>There are at least as many bugs left to be found as there are users who haven't yet run your code.</STRONG></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>(Special thanks to <A href="http://www.bway.net/~dfenton/">David Fenton</A> for pointing out the corollary to Axiom V, years ago!)</P></FONT>

Having one other experienced person go over your code once is significantly better than you reading your code many times over looking for bugs.<br></div>

Kaplan</strong> on Saturday, November 12, 2005 9:30 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Hi Maurits --<br><br>Ok, I agree with the principle of Theorem II -- though it may be a corollary of Axioms II, III, and IV? :-)<br><br>But then it does also depend on Theorem I, so perhaps it is a theorem.....</div>
<p><a id="492091" href="#492091">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on Saturday, November 12, 2005 9:32 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Hi Jonathan --<br><br>I agree with the statement, but I am not sure we can call it a theorem of Test without working on the specific language a bit (as currently worded it seems more like a dev-focused item).</div>
<p><a id="492094" href="#492094">#</a> <strong>Serge Wautier</strong> on Saturday, November 12, 2005 9:52 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">The more a bug is difficult to identify, the more valuable it is. Because the more other unknown bugs it will help uncover during its debugging.<br><br>[Speaking of bug, can somebody pleeease help the 'Remember me' checkbox actually remember me...]</div>
<p><a id="492100" href="#492100">#</a> <strong>Nicholas Allen</strong> on Saturday, November 12, 2005 10:52 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">I don't like the third axiom at all.<br><br>If something breaks and nothing changed, you just don't KNOW what changed.</div>
<p><a id="492124" href="#492124">#</a> <strong>Marvin</strong> on Saturday, November 12, 2005 1:14 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Theorem VI: The more bugs you have found in a module, the more bugs there are left undetected.<br><br>Corrolary: If you have two modules: one that had a few bugs in the past and another that had a lot, spend more time testing the second one.</div>
<p><a id="492131" href="#492131">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on Saturday, November 12, 2005 1:29 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Hi Nick -- the implication of the third axiom (which perhaps should be recast to include include this info) is that sometimes external changes cause a break -- so even if the code is not changed, something can break it.</div>
<p><a id="492132" href="#492132">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on Saturday, November 12, 2005 1:30 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Marvin, I love it! And I get your Theorem IV (we aee only up theorem IV so far!) pointed out by example all the time. :-)</div>
<p><a id="492143" href="#492143">#</a> <strong>Nicholas Allen</strong> on Saturday, November 12, 2005 2:21 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Michael- Yeah, that's totally right.  I'm just being pedagogical.  A lot of software bugs get papered over instead of fixed because programmers don't think about what's going on outside their code.</div>
<p><a id="492159" href="#492159">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on Saturday, November 12, 2005 4:39 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">I think your point is a good one though. How about changing from this:<br><br>&quot;Sometimes when it is not changed, it breaks too.&quot;<br><br>to this:<br><br>&quot;Sometimes when it is not changed, external factors can break it, anyway.&quot;</div>
<p><a id="492192" href="#492192">#</a> <strong>Marvin</strong> on Saturday, November 12, 2005 9:30 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">It was supposed to be Axiom VI. No idea why I typed theorem ;-)<br><br>Seriously this fact is supported by statistics and is often mentioned in books about software testing (I once read a few for general education). I also had many chances to see how true it is.</div>
<p><a id="492193" href="#492193">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on Saturday, November 12, 2005 9:40 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Ah, that may take more thought (it is not that I disagree, it is that we have to be cautious about adding new axioms to a system!).</div>
<p><a id="492223" href="#492223">#</a> <strong>Jerry Pisk</strong> on Sunday, November 13, 2005 3:27 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">I don't think the third axiom talks about external factors. I think it simply points out the fact that even code that did not change has bugs that you didn't find earlier. An external factor might have exposed the bug instead of causing it.</div>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Last weekend, Dean Harding <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/11/13/492179.html#492326">commented</A>&nbsp;when I was talking about preferring uppercase before lowercase or vice-versa:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><EM><FONT size=2>The whole idea of sorting (at least for latin-based scripts) is just convention anyway... I mean, you may well ask "why should 'A' come before 'a'?" but then why not ask "why should 'a' come before 'z'?" there doesn't seem to be any actual reasoning behind the 'sort order' of our alphabet at all! </FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT size=2>Unless, I'm missing something here... </FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Dean wasn't missing anything here, no. But </FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>I thought that might be worth a little discussion. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I remember Cathy and I doing a presentation a while back for the group about collation (similar to the ones we did at <A href="http://www.unicode.org/iuc/iuc22/a015.html">IUC22</A> and&nbsp;<A href="http://www.unicode.org/iuc/iuc23/a322.html">IUC23</A>) and we talked about how to someone speaking English or German Å comes after A while in Swedish it comes after Z. After the presentation colleague (and native Swede)&nbsp;Anna came up to gently correct us since although people speaking English might make that 'incorrect' choice, people speaking German would not. We stuck to our guns and it&nbsp;was only after&nbsp;a bit of investigation that she realized that Germans 'got it wrong', too!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Then last year, Kieran suggested that I check out <A href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060958332/">The Language Instinct : How the Mind Creates Language</A>&nbsp;by Steven Pinker. It is one of those great tomes that can speak to people who are not necessarily linguists, and help anyone understand more about language than they ever did previously. I knew I was learning something when over half of the linguistic factoids that were being shared with me each day were things that I had also read in the book. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Anyway, given how fascinated I was by collation, I admit I was at first disappointed that so little was said about&nbsp;the subject&nbsp;in the book, which was really blowing me away otherwise. There is only a&nbsp;brief mention is in Chapter 8:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT size=2><EM>...for the same reason that alphbetical order is similar across the Hebrew, Greek, Roman, and Cyrillic alphabets. There is nothing special about alphabetical order; it was just the order that the Caananites invented, and all Western alphbets came from theirs.</EM></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I admit that I felt a little odd having such a passion about something that apparently had very little meaning in a 'linguistic' sense. It is probably about the time that I dubbed the term 'delusions of linguistic aptitude' to describe myself. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Now I got over it pretty quickly, because I realized that this one sentence did not invalidate my interest, and it certainly didn't invalidate the importance of it given all of the places that collation is used. It is shortly after that time when I posted <STRONG><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2004/12/18/323941.html">Putting Your Ducks in a Row</A></STRONG> about different 'alphabetical orders' -- the large degree of variation between&nbsp;them and some of the many different principles behind them. And this does not even get into the fact that people are used to them and are confused any time things are not in the order that they expect (which is usually alphabetical order).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I am still fascinated by collation, probably at least in some part now because as cool as language as an instinct is, the fact that collation is so ingrained in people that they do not even realize its not an instinct (hell, in most cases they do not even realizes it varies between languages in a single script!)....</FONT></P>

My loss, I think.<br><br>Do you have other works to recommend?  I'm interested in language as related to information processing and also the business of Unicode and all of the complex ways that the codes are used in expressing texts of different languages.  I have the Unicode 3.0 and 4.0 books but would like some other guide to practice.<br><br>[I have this vague recollection that code-point sorting reverses the &quot;a&quot; (lower-case)versus &quot;A&quot; (upper case) choice in EBCDIC versus ASCII, and that might still influence some views on the matter for geeks in Roman togas.  I suspect a fading generational difference in what is thought to be the &quot;right&quot; answer among techies.]</div>

It was, rather, a system of consonantal signs, of similar shapes and style, which could be adapted at choice or convenience to represent the consonants of languages observed (or devised) by the Eldar. None of the letters had in itself a fixed value; but certain relations between them were gradually recognized.<br>(J. R. R. Tolkien: The Lord of the Rings, Return of the King, Appendix E)</div>

Isn't it? :-)<br><br>Orcmid -- let me give that some thought. I actually did try to tackle some harder to approach linguistic work after reading several Pinker books and found it more challenging without formal training. But there are some folks I can ask here about other recommendations. And I will try to post soon on Unicode and related references. :-)</div>

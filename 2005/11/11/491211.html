<P><FONT face=Tahoma>About a year ago I talked about "<a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2004/12/25/332259.html"><STRONG>What the %$#! are genitive dates?</STRONG></A><FONT face=Tahoma>" and&nbsp;then yesterday I talked about them <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/11/10/491187.html">again</A> and then <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/11/10/491199.html">again</A>.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It turns out there may also be different behavior for Sami, a language for which we added nine locales in Windows XP SP2:</FONT></P><FONT face=Tahoma>
<LI><FONT size=2>Northern Sami - Norway </FONT>
<LI><FONT size=2>Northern Sami - Sweden </FONT>
<LI><FONT size=2>Northern Sami - Finland </FONT>
<LI><FONT size=2>Lule Sami - Norway </FONT>
<LI><FONT size=2>Lule Sami - Sweden </FONT>
<LI><FONT size=2>Southern Sami - Norway </FONT>
<LI><FONT size=2>Southern Sami - Sweden </FONT>
<LI><FONT size=2>Skolt Sami - Finland</FONT> 
<LI><FONT size=2>Inari Sami - Finland</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The exact information was sketchy (admittedly it may just be that I did not understand the information) but apparently there may&nbsp;be different cases where genitive month forms would sometimes be used and sometimes not, depending on the format being used and whether the month name comes before or after the day.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Here is what we have using that code from the other day, using the "Northern Sami - Norway" locale:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Courier New" size=2><STRONG>oddajagemánnu&nbsp;&nbsp; oddajagemánu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; oddajagemánu 1. b. 2005<BR>guovvamánnu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; guovvamánu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; guovvamánu 1. b. 2005<BR>njukcamánnu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; njukcamánu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; njukcamánu 1. b. 2005<BR>cuoŋománnu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cuoŋománu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cuoŋománu 1. b. 2005<BR>miessemánnu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; miessemánu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; miessemánu 1. b. 2005<BR>geassemánnu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; geassemánu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; geassemánu 1. b. 2005<BR>suoidnemánnu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; suoidnemánu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; suoidnemánu 1. b. 2005<BR>borgemánnu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; borgemánu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; borgemánu 1. b. 2005<BR>cakcamánnu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cakcamánu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cakcamánu 1. b. 2005<BR>golggotmánnu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; golggotmánu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; golggotmánu 1. b. 2005<BR>skábmamánnu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; skábmamánu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; skábmamánu 1. b. 2005<BR>juovlamánnu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; juovlamánu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; juovlamánu 1. b. 2005</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Are there any native Sami speakers who can help shed light on whether there is a problem here, and how common that problem might be seen? Would you expect the nominative month name to be used if the parts of the date string were ordered differently?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And there was one more question for you, if you are out there and willing to answer....&nbsp;:-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>When the Sami locales were added in Windows XP SP2, there was no information of the collation used by any of the nine. It seemed to be more sensible to at least use the Norwegien, Swedish, and Finnish collations for the various Sami locales as appropriate, but it is unclear if there is a specific collation preference for Sami beyond that or instead of that. Any takers?</FONT></P>

With only a few thousand potential users (generous estimate) of some locales listed above you're skating on thin ice. Are you sure a dozen Americans who read your blog could reproduce the US English collation or come close? I certainly wouldn't trust the average US citizen to &quot;correct&quot; my spelling and grammar in translations...</div>

Fixed now....<br><br>For the other question, I am just soliciting opinions. Of course actual decisions will be researched further.<br><br>Plus I am not sure I have a dozen readers, it may be only half that. :-)</div>

Although it was perhaps reasonable, there is really no way to guess what people might be expecting....</div>

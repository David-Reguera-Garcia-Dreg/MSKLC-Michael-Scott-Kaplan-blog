<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Just a quick M.S. update for the curious....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I just had my second Novantrone infusion this morning, but I am starting to doubt that thing about the whites of the eyes getting bluish. I think they tell people that since it encourages folks like me to sign up for being poisoned every three months. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But the infusion went well once it started.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It started a little late because the order never made it in front of my neurologist and the nurses in Special Procedures will not do the infusion without a signed order (cannot be faxed). On top of that, the pharmacy will not dispense the medication to Special Procedures without such an order, either.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But my neuro came in herself and we chatted for a bit as she filled out the form, and the NP came down and gave me money for parking. So all was good.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I'll let you know how I am feeling in a few days. In the meantime, I&nbsp;am a conditional fan of the whole Novantrone thing....&nbsp;:-)</FONT></P>

I stumbled across your blog while searching for Novotrone (my partner has just been advised to have chemo, which is pretty scary news to receive from your neuro).<br><br>These posts were very reassuring - it's nice to know that we're not alone. So, please keep up the good work, and don't feel bad for posting about the MS stuff. I've read lots of msdn blogs (I'm a developer), and yours has been, by far, the most valuable.</div>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Back many years ago when I first moved to Columbus, OH (the place I lived before Redmond, WA) I owned a cat named Kim (short for Kimberly Cleopatra).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Well, I didn't really own Kim; no one ever really owns a cat. I think she pretty much owned me. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Anyway, she injured herself and the veternarian had to put one of those collars on her for a few days. His parting advice was to have Kim take it easy for a few days.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It was at first kind of amusing to me, thinking&nbsp;that he must not own a cat if he thinks such things are under the control of the "owner" of the animal.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But my thought later was wondering how an animal who sleeps 21 hours a day can actually "take it easy". Since that appears to be her job, her nature, what she just naturally does.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Kim has passed on now (she was quite a few years old when&nbsp;I inherited her)....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Anyway, assuming you are still reading I will explain where I am going with this.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>There is an interesting side conversation going on in the comments of posts like the one I wrote about <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/11/26/495072.html">the Hungarian technical sort</A>&nbsp;or about <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/11/13/492179.html">whether <STRONG>a</STRONG> comes before <STRONG>A</STRONG></A>. The interesting part is people talking bout the various expectations of different kinds of users, who may or may nor be in different locations or speaking different languages or performing different tasks.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I found it quite amusing as people from different viewpoints added their opinions about what was the expectation, which seemed to change depending on all of those different factors.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And I was in a meeting yesterday where I found myself amused again as people in the meeting talked about the expectations of users who may prefer English sorting versus German sorting versus Dutch sorting.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It was at first kind of amusing to me since all three of those languages use the <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2004/12/08/278170.html">default collation table</A>, so it seemed funny to talk about conflicting expectations when all three would sort the same way on Windows. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But my thought later was wondering how a feature that the majority of users cannot describe the rules of effectively could engender so many discussions!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It is just the natural expectations that people expect Windows to <STRONG>do</STRONG> for them.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And as I watched the uncontrollable force of the people in the meeting talking about the people who use Windows, as&nbsp;I thought about the readers of this blog who commented about their various (sometimes&nbsp;conflicting) expectations that <EM>they</EM> have around collation which are also quite uncontrollable, I can't help remembering Kimberly Cleopatra and hoping she has found her door into summer.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>After all, her expectations pretty much represented "the way things are supposed to be", too.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Maybe that is why i like collation so much -- its cat-like-inspiring qualities? :-)</FONT></P>

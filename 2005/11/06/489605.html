<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Saying <STRONG>please</STRONG> and <STRONG>thank you</STRONG> is something that is taken for granted here in the USA and other places.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I remember being struck as a tenager&nbsp;by Jonathan M. Ford's take on such terms, through the eyes of a Klingonaase captain:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT size=2><EM>The Admiral got up from his chair. "Another?" he said, pointing at Krenn's glass.</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><EM>"Please," said Krenn. He had had a hard time getting used to the word. But after a day on the Starbase, Krenn realized that the Humans used it continuously, across all levels of authority, for requests of any or no importance: the word simply had no meaning.</EM></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And then again a few pages later:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT size=2><EM>"So you were just following orders?"</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><EM>"Do officers of the Federation not follow orders?"</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><EM>Whitetree leaned forward, about to say something, then he sat back slowly. His expression had changed wholly, though the shifts of flesh were small. "I'm . . . sorry, Captain."</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><EM>Krenn had heard that word too: it seemed to have more of its meaning left than </EM>please<EM> did. And, watching the Human, Krenn thought he intended that it should have meaning now.</EM></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I was thinking about this last week while I was staying in a hotel and noticed once again that on ordering room service that a 17% gratuity was pre-calculated as&nbsp;a part of the bill (and of course there was an additional place for a tip if I wanted to write one in).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I was also thinking about time I spent in Ireland this Summer where the service in several restaurants was terrible and tips were almost never left by people. It is easy to hypothesize about the connection, though I doubt that the service for an institutionalized tip is any better (I was honestly not even sure that what the hotel called a gratuity even went to the employee or not; I also was not sure how best to find out the truthful answer on the topic, and never have).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And I was thinking about it again a few days ago when my sister-out-law Jenny was&nbsp;speculating about the strange interactions with a cashier who says <STRONG>thank you</STRONG> when you pay and then you say <STRONG>thank you</STRONG> for the change -- there is not much time for more than that (without holding up the line!) and how truly sincere is it when it is a mechanical part of a transaction, no matter how polite everyone involved is?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So why did the word <STRONG>please</STRONG> seem to have no meaning to someone who was new to the language (well, ignoring the fact that it was obviously fiction, of course!)? Obviously the fact that it is used so often tends to water down the meaning, until it is almost brought down to the level of a particle in English -- a sound that you say at certain times because it is sort of expected.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I stopped using the word <STRONG>please</STRONG> for the most part except when it is emphasized as a point of sarcasm. I joked with people that saying <STRONG>please</STRONG> in this context anticipates that something will be done without it happening, whereas saying <STRONG>thank you</STRONG> in a warm tone&nbsp;may make it clear that it really is appreciated (and is most commonly said after something is done anyway). But under the joke was the serious notion that there is really no way to impart meaning into the word <STRONG>please</STRONG> without implying that you think someone might not do what you are asking. And how often will that truly happen?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Now of course <STRONG>thank you</STRONG> has its own watering down that happens, but not as much as please, in part because you can say it with some feeling (kind of like <STRONG>I'm sorry</STRONG>, now that I think about it). You can, in a sense, impart some pragmatic content to your words with your tone of voice -- something that may be implied in words that are read, depending on the circumstances being described.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So, according to <A href="http://dictionary.reference.com/">dictionary.com</A>, the linguistic meaning of the word <A href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=particle">particle</A> is:</FONT><FONT face=Tahoma></P>
<OL type=a>
<LI type=a>An uninflected item that has grammatical function but does not clearly belong to one of the major parts of speech, such as <I>up</I> in <I>He looked up the word</I> or <I>to</I> in English infinitives. 
<LI type=a>In some systems of grammatical analysis, any of various short function words, including articles, prepositions, and conjunctions. </LI></OL></FONT>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I think it is easy enough to at least <EM>consider</EM> that most inflections of <STRONG>please</STRONG> might be considered particles now.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The most ironic part for me was how in Hebrew, the same word (<STRONG>בבקשה</STRONG>) is used for both <STRONG>please</STRONG> and <STRONG>thank you</STRONG>. I have not really tried too hard to figure out what that means, though there are other items in the Hebrew language that have similar simplifications (there are fewer prepositions, for example -- you can often tell if someone is still translating in their mind from Hebrew to English if they confuse <STRONG>in</STRONG> and <STRONG>on</STRONG>, for example). But with <STRONG>בבקשה</STRONG>&nbsp;(b'vakashah) I wonder if Hebrew has made it less of a particle than it seems to have become in English....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma color=#ff1493><EM>This post brought to you by</EM> "<FONT size=6>ב</FONT>" <EM>(<A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/05d1">U+05d1</A>, a.k.a. HEBREW LETTER BET)<BR><FONT size=1>When used a prefix to a word in Hebrew can mean either <STRONG>in</STRONG> or <STRONG>on</STRONG>, making some George Carlin jokes much less understandable in Hebrew (e.g. "Let the daredevils get <STRONG>on</STRONG> the plane; I am getting <STRONG>in</STRONG> the plane!")</FONT></EM></FONT></P>

For example:&lt;/P&gt;<br>&lt;P&gt;Person A: &quot;Mumble Mumble Mumble&quot;&lt;/P&gt;<br>&lt;P&gt;Person B: &quot;Please?&quot;&lt;/P&gt;<br>&lt;P&gt;Person A: &quot;Sorry - Where is the restroom located&quot;&lt;/P&gt;<br>&lt;P&gt;Person B: &quot;Oh - its right over there&quot;&lt;/P&gt;<br>&lt;P&gt;This situation played out humourously, when my brother and his friend came to visit me at school, and his friend attempted to order a diet coke...&lt;/P&gt;<br>&lt;P&gt;Guy &quot;I'll have a diet coke.&quot;&lt;/P&gt;<br>&lt;P&gt;Waitress (who did not hear him correctly) &quot;Please?&quot;&lt;/P&gt;<br>&lt;P&gt;Guy (chastised for poor manners) &quot;I'll have a diet coke, please.&quot;&lt;/P&gt;<br>&lt;P&gt;good stuff.&lt;/P&gt;<br>&lt;P&gt;-Z&lt;/P&gt;</div>

The concept does not exist in scandinavian languages! We sometimes use &quot;thank you&quot; where an american would use &quot;please&quot; but most of the time it's just silent and implied.</div>

Eventually they began to use these pleasantries, and I started dropping them...</div>

It commonly appears in set phrases for polite speech forms.  Particles generally modify the function of nearby words while please modifies the tone of the sentence.</div>

And in those cases the particle acts like a &quot;yes, continue&quot; which entirely matches if someone is pouring coffee and you say &quot;please&quot; to get them to pour yours....</div>

When I went to the US a few years ago, at first I was quite impressed with how polite everybody seemed to be (then again, I was in Minnesota, which is supposedly famous for it's &quot;Minnesota Nice&quot;) until I realised that it was just automatic for everbody.<br><br>Once I came to the conclusion that everybody was so polite just because that's how they were to everyone, it just made all conversations so *impersonal*.  Like I was talking to a robot.<br><br>Also, in Australia, we don't have this idea of &quot;compulsory tipping&quot;.  If you don't do a good job, you don't get a tip!  I don't mind giving a tip for someone who goes out of their way to make my stay or my meal extra special, but if you're just doing your job why should I give you extra money?  My boss doesn't give me a tip for coming in to work every day, so why should I give a complete stranger one for doing the same thing?</div>
<p><a id="489636" href="#489636">#</a> <strong>Nicholas Allen</strong> on 6 Nov 2005 6:42 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Michael-<br><br>Is there a specific particle you have in mind?  The ones that I can think of that work as sentences imply the use of nouns and verbs that the particle modifies.<br><br>(This is not to say that Japanese and English particles even HAVE to work the same way.  The two languages have different grammars and we merely reuse grammatical terms for concepts that seem similar.  That doesn't mean the concepts are the same.  For instance, you can say that Japanese has tenses and transitive verbs but these concepts are not 100% identical in function to the concepts with the same name in English.)</div>

If I give someone a tip, I give it to *them* - not to the person waiting tables at the other end of the restaurant...<br><br>Ah well, tipping is a sensitive topic for me :) I just came back from Ireland and we had this rather unpleasant taxi driver... anyway, once we got out we pretty much counted out the pennies of the fare so that he wouldn't have to give us change.

In Hebrew you literally &quot;raise to the plain&quot; (לעלות למטוס) so either &quot;in&quot; or &quot;on&quot; will not be appropriate. As for ב prefix it always means &quot;in&quot; in the sense &quot;being inside&quot; and never &quot;on&quot; in the sense &quot;on top of&quot;. It is English that is horribly confused between &quot;in&quot; and &quot;on&quot;. (Just kidding of course. Most auxillaries are just conventions that had long ago lost most of their original meaning.)</div>
<p><a id="489727" href="#489727">#</a> <strong>Mihai</strong> on 7 Nov 2005 1:18 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">One of the first impressions when I first arrived here was that “everybody is nice and friendly.” After living here for a while, this changed and I know this is mostly “robot talk” and when I checkout from Albertson and they ask “how are you” they don’t care at all. But if I go somewhere else (i.e. New York) I have the feeling of “rude” if it is missing.<br><br>Same with the tip: it was a reward for someone being more helpful than what is expected. But because “when in Rome, do what the Romans do” principle, I have learned to tip, when and how much.<br>But once in a while I still give a tip smaller than the norm to show that I was not happy with the food cold and late. So I find “pre-calculated gratuity as a part of the bill” revolting when it happens. I feel like someone put his hand in my pocket.<br></div>

On a trip to the East coast when I was in high school several of us always said &quot;thank you&quot; and many people stared at us like we were speaking in some alien tongue or were just surprised that people remember those two words.<br><br>Many times I've seen at least &quot;thank you&quot; put smiles on people's faces, like thanking a waiter or waitress at a restaurant.</div>

An example of a watered down word is the way a Politician might insist that it was a &quot;thorough&quot; investigation into the possible misdeed. When the word investigation seizes to exist without the prefix &quot;thorough,&quot; then you know the thorough part is losing its meaning.</div>

I usually see it translated as &quot;please&quot; but it gets used if the listener is being asked to do anything, no matter how small. Even a routine instruction like &quot;take part A from the box&quot; can have a kudasai on the end, which isn't a situation that calls for a &quot;please&quot; in other languages.<br>I don't know Japanese well enough to know if this is just a super-formal mode of address, or some special written convention (I can't recall hearing Japanese speakers employing kudasai much).</div>

<p>I think that using the word &quot;please&quot; has become such an automatic thing, that to NOT use it comes across as a deliberate insult, whether it's intended that way or not.</p>
<p>For example, I am an operator on a telephone switchboard for a large company. &nbsp;When someone calls in and simply announces a name (for me to connect them to) it just sounds really rude. &nbsp;However, if they say &quot;[insert name here], please.&quot; it sounds so much better, even if spoken in the same tone of voice. &nbsp;</p></div>

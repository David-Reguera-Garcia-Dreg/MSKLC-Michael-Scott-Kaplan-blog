<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I will be heading out of town in a little while until just after Thanksgiving, for a little vacation (I will actually be back in Cleveland for a few days over Thanksgiving).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I mention "a little vacation" since I will be working some of that time, too. There is no rest for the wicked, I suppose....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>(Not to say I could not use the break from work that will be able to happen for at least some of it!)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I'll be seeing <A href="http://www.kathleenedwards.com/">Kathleen Edwards</A>&nbsp;perform while I'm there (she is playing The Village in Dublin, highly recommended!).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But I will try to report more on that Irish accent phenomenon I mentioned near the end of <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/07/10/437330.html">this post</A>. Several people sent hypotheses on it to me in mail back then, and I will see if i can formulate at least a potential theory by the time I get back to the United States.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>As I am sure all of you who know me can guess, I will be looking in on the blog from time to time, though&nbsp;it will not be a constant thing.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So those of you who like to comment who have not registered at <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/">blogs.msdn.com</A> might want to consider doing so if you don't want to wait for your comments to be made available.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Of course, I don't mind if you don't, but I thought I would mention it so nobody feels like they are being mistreated while I am out of town.... :-)</FONT></P>

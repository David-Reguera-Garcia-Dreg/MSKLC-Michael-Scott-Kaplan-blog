<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Back in August in the post <STRONG><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/08/10/449909.html">Double compressions -- Hungarian goulash?</A></STRONG> I described how double compressions worked in Windows and the .NET Framework.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And then a week ago in <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/11/13/491646.html"><STRONG>Hungarian is even more complicated than I thought</STRONG></A> I talked about an additional interesting wrinkle in this particular language's collation.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>There were some interesting comments in that post, like this one:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><EM><FONT size=2>I tell you a story. I had a strange error on MS SQL Server. select ... where [Product Identifier] = '%SG%' did no find the product with the identifier of "KCSG01" </FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT size=2>A friend suggested that maybe it treats "cs" as one letter. I said impossible, even MS can't be so crazy. And he was right - after setting collation to binary it worked! </FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT size=2>I it is completely amazing - who wanted this this feature? Who needs it? Why did it have to be developed and hardcoded into Windows/MS SQL? I agree that a grammatical analyser function library might sometimes useful to someone, but to hardcode it right into the OS!... Why? </FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT size=2>When users search for "ddzs", they don't want to find "dzsdzs" - they are searching for LETTERS, you know, they don't want to keep all these grammatical rules in their heads. No one expects that their search input will be grammatically analysed! </FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT size=2>So why has this feature been implemented?</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>To which I thought about the fact the Hungarian Technical Sort exists as <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/11/25/494976.html">an alternate sort</A> for Hungarian (its LCID is 0x1040e). This sort has several characteristics that distinguish it from the standard Hungarian sort (0x040e):</FONT></P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>None of the compressions that I have talked about <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/07/17/439742.html">previously</A></FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>None of those Hungarian double compressions, either</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>The uppercase letters come before the lowercase ones, <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/11/13/492179.html">unlike most other language</A>&nbsp;collations on Microsoft products</FONT></LI></UL>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>There is, in fact, nothing uniquely Hungarian about it and anyone who was wanting the uppercase/lowercase thing reversed might be happy with the ordering.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The perfect answer for those more technical situations when one does not want to be bogged down by those linguistic collation details, right? :-)</FONT></P>

Did Microsoft ever do surveys of real users (not linguists, not people who have a  nationalist propaganda mission) to find out how many of them actually want the supposed oddities of &quot;their&quot; language systemised in the computer? It's been mentioned before that a lot of people can't describe the collation rules for their language, but how many really /prefer/ the official collation rules, given an option? How many can look at a dozen lists and pick out the one that's &quot;in the right order&quot; ?<br><br>Unfortunately when something is done wrong in a million computers it may be a lot harder to fix than a mistake (or exageration) in a textbook or research paper. So we ought to be very careful before enshrining such rules in a computer program, even if implementing them is fun.<br><br>IMNSHO when you find yourself forcing people to stay true to someone's ideal of their culture or language, you've made a huge mistake somewhere. This applies to Welsh culture &amp; language laws in the UK (forcing children to learn an essentially dead language to satisfy the ambitions of some nationalist politicians) even more than the Acad&#233;mie fran&#231;aise (at least the Acad&#233;mie doesn't have force of law).</div>

Kaplan</strong> on 26 Nov 2005 5:21 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Nick,<br><br>When people are unhappy with behavior on Windows, we hear about it. And I am not talking about people who read this blog, I mean regular users who do not like the behavior.<br><br>I know you think what Windows does here is incorrect, but I have millions of users who use Windows and find the results to be intuitive that are basically suggesting implicitly that you are in the minority.... :-)</div>
<p><a id="497252" href="#497252">#</a> <strong>Nick Lamb</strong> on 27 Nov 2005 4:53 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">&quot;I know you think what Windows does here is incorrect&quot;<br><br>You've misconstrued my comment. I don't know whether this is incorrect, I was wondering (and you could have answered) whether it was ever put into a usability lab for comparison. I do know that several people in my circle were relieved when I showed them how to disable the &quot;English&quot; collation rules on their Unix systems, but my sample is biased, lots of technical and scientific types, not many warm fuzzy people.<br><br>By the way, how can they do that in Windows? They'd like to, but I couldn't find any way to help them.</div>
<p><a id="497260" href="#497260">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 27 Nov 2005 6:32 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Which English collation rules in particular?</div>
<p><a id="497263" href="#497263">#</a> <strong>Nick Lamb</strong> on 27 Nov 2005 8:42 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Particularly the case ordering, they want (THAT, THIS, the other) rather than (THAT, the other, THIS).</div>
<p><a id="497271" href="#497271">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 27 Nov 2005 11:52 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">We do not really get a call for binary ordering at all, really. There is no mode in Windows that gives you that currently.<br><br>Possible on UNIX? Well, okay. Perhaps that explains why UNIX isn't really a consumer OS? :-)</div>
<p><a id="497906" href="#497906">#</a> <strong>Szajd</strong> on 29 Nov 2005 11:34 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Nick,<br><br>You're thinking is bad, because you can't imagine a language that has, for example, letters consisting of two characters.<br><br>For us, Hungarian's, such a thing is not an &quot;oddity&quot;, a &quot;strange thing&quot;, or even a thing to think about; it's the most natural thing in the world.<br><br>I suppose, you're language is English, and that's bad, because it's hard for me to tell you an example, to imagine yourself in such a situation.<br>But let's try it: imagine, that the English language includes the letter 'ph': if your operating system would handle that one as a letter P and H, THAT would be odd. Because it would brake something, that is actually natural to you.</div>

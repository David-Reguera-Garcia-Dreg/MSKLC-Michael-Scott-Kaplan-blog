<P><FONT face=Tahoma><EM>From the <STRONG>I Can't Believe Michael Said That Out Loud</STRONG> files....</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>A few years ago, <A href="http://www.aimeemann.com/">Aimee Mann</A> was talking about the song Long Shot from her album I'm With Stupid:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><EM>There are at least four songs on it that I wrote for myself and said, 'It's fine. This will never get on the album anyway.' 'Long Shot' was one of those and lo and behold, it's the single. You don't put words like 'You fucked it up' into a song if you want it to be a single. But that line had to be there; it had to have that sound of colloquial dismissiveness.</EM></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So perhaps I should not have <STRONG>ISO 8601 is asinine</STRONG> as the title of my post. But that title has to be there; I had to have that </FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>sound of not entirely colloquial dismissiveness? :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><EM>(I also do really like Long Shot by the way, though only live --&nbsp;mostly because when it is performed live there is a very awesome Julian Coryell electric guitar solo at the end which is just a serious rocking-out fest that you can close a show with. An entirely irrelevant and off-topic&nbsp;point but it must be said&nbsp;because Julian is an awesome guitarist!)</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I'll put up the <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">Wikipedia link on ISO 8601</A>, although who knows what that will say tomorrow. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But anyway, </FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>I was reading the other day in the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sqlclr/default.aspx">SQL Server 2005: CLR Integration</A> blog, in Isaac K. Kunen's post <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sqlclr/archive/2005/11/11/491981.aspx">Best Week Ever</A>. Isaac explained one of examples of a difference between what SQL Server 2005 does and what ISO8601 says:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><EM>Unfortunately, SQL Server defines the first week of the year as the week in which 1 January lies.&nbsp; (Some of us would argue that this makes more sense, but ISO 8601 says what ISO 8601 says.)</EM></P>
<P><EM>What's a poor database developer to do?&nbsp; Wait until the next release of SQL Server?</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Why do we have this preconeived notion that if it is an ISO standard, it is better? There are lots of times that this is not the case, and this standard especially is one of them.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Why? I'll tell you. Because what it tries to do as a standard is to regularize many aspects of dates/time handling that&nbsp;actually vary depending on the location in which you sit. That is why the <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/intl/nls_34rz.asp">GetLocaleInfo</A> function has an <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/intl/nls_8rse.asp">LCTYPE</A> representing the first week of the year&nbsp;(LOCALE_IFIRSTWEEKOFYEAR) with one of the following entries in it:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The date behind these same two <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/intl/nls_8rse.asp">LCTYPE</A>&nbsp;values are the ones used for <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfsystemglobalizationdatetimeformatinfoclasstopic.asp">DateTimeFormatInfo</A>'s <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfsystemglobalizationdatetimeformatinfoclassfirstdayofweektopic.asp">FirstDayOfWeek</A> and <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfsystemglobalizationdatetimeformatinfoclasscalendarweekruletopic.asp">CalendarWeekRule</A> properties.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The simple issue is one of respect -- respecting the fact that in different places there are different preferences. How can someone ignore those preferences?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>One could argue&nbsp;that the problem is not with the international&nbsp;standard that steamrolls over those preferences, it is with the&nbsp;products that it used where it should not be. But that ignores the fact that people like to follow international standards, even in cases such as this one&nbsp;where it makes them look&nbsp;like lemmings going right off the cliff of common sense.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Off the top of my head I cannot recall if SQL Server follows a LOCALE_IFIRSTWEEKOFYEAR-esque solution or is hardcoded to use the '0' entry in our locale data -- so I am not sure if they need a little work here, too. I'll give it a try at some point to&nbsp;find out for sure, if someone else does not report back on this point first! :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Now there are other examples in ISO 8601 that do the same sort of regularization of something that is truly different in different locales. And the W3C uses it to try to reduce complexity and errors&nbsp;which&nbsp;is a great goal unless it causes a de facto&nbsp;cultural imperialism of sorts by forcing people to change the way <EM>they</EM> think about software.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I may be inviting with my&nbsp;provocative viewpoint&nbsp;a whole host of fans of the ISO 8601 standard to complain about why it is so crucial that this standard exist, so let me mention ahead of time where my biggest problem is with it -- that it tries to be human readable in so many cases. If it is human readable than it ought to prefer user preferences for locales. If </FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>ISO 8601:</FONT></P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>only tried to define a binary standard, and</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>removed all of the pieces that did not forward the binary standard, and</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>did not struggle to point out those various attempts at better human readability, and</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>if it strongly discouraged people from plugging in the various pieces in the way that Isaac was implying SQL Server ought to in a future version, and</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>if it worked harder to point out how wrong it is to misuse it in so many of these other contexts</FONT></LI></UL>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>then perhaps I would not mind it as much. Then I would just focus on the people misusing it.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But in its current form, it is just too easy to misuse in software products in the name of conformance to standards. Even when doing so makes the standard look bad, and the software products look worse....</FONT></P>

That's what the Excel team did in many places for example, and the result is that an arbitrary Excel spreadsheet is meaningful ONLY in the context of the exact same Windows version and configuration which created it.<br><br>The W3C can't say (as Microsoft does) &quot;Oh, well, you just need to ensure that every computer which needs access to this document is identically configured&quot;, because they set standards for a genuinely global, world wide web. So here's a standard for representing time that's international.<br><br>Although it's briefly fun to characterise all attempts at harmonisation as &quot;cultural imperialism&quot; it doesn't really make any sense in the context of international standards bodies. Whose culture is being imposed on whom? Am I being Japanised by using Year-Month-Day order? Or is it a conspiracy by the West to impose  the latin letter T on the millions of Chinese? Isn't it possible that people from around the world agreed on something, and that defying it is rather perverse?</div>

The way people measure has very little to do with culture. My grandfather didn't use kilograms and meters and yet I belong to the same culture as he did. British switched to decimal currency and did not become less distinct from Americans. Modern Israelis use Gregorian calendar almost exclusively (apart from some formal and religious occasions) and nobody thinks they are less Jewish for that. Heck, some countries even switched from left-hand-side to right-hand-side driving without loosing a bit of their culture ;-)<br>The &quot;weights and measures&quot; standards are arbitrary things that can be changed at a whim. Bringing &quot;cultural diversity&quot; into technical discussion about them is just relying on taboo words. <br>(Since you are a fan of Steven Pinker a nice discussion of invoking taboo principle can be found in his &quot;The Blank Slate&quot; ;-)<br></div>

It is certainly not Microsoft's or any other company's job to tell people what to do. However, this has nothing to do with ISO 8601 standard. Standards like it exist to allow people to communicate. It is good that MS software allows me to use pounds and feet when I need them but when I need to send data abroad it should better support kilograms and meters too. You wouldn't call SI units (also I think an ISO standard) asinine, would you? Microsoft's locale oriented approach is one good thing and international common date and time standard is another. They don't compete with each other.</div>

Our release schedules are tracked by week number, so it is a big help for everyone to agree on a single way to count the week numbers, and each year we release an official company calendar with our week numbers. Any standard can be followed (witness Kodak using the reformed calendar that George Eastman touted up until very recently, as I recall) as long as its consistent, but it might as well be a single, agreed upon standard, and ISO 8601 fits that purpose. I certainly think software and OSs should allow localization of the date format, including week numbering -- but an easy way to support a standard format is also desirable in today's global economy.<br></div>

There's a reason all diseases have Latin names in the medical arena - so doctors can agree on what to call them.  That way a doctor only has to learn one extra language (Latin) besides what he needs to serve his local patients (one or more of various languages, depending on where he lives) and to communicate with his local staff.<br><br>The fact that no regions currently speak Latin is irrelevant.</div>

If I call a client in Algiers on Friday morning, I probably will not be welcome...<br><br>Also, most people will exclude the traditionnal fixed notworking days from the count; that is, in Christian regions, 1/1 is usually NOT counted as a weekday.<br><br><br>And this really boilds down to decide if the first day of the week is the first &quot;weekday&quot; (as it is in some part of Europe, and then LOCALE_IFIRSTWEEKOFYEAR=2 does the job; that the reasonning behind ISO 8601 BTW), or if it is instead a rest day (a widely used religious interpretation); or even something else.<br><br>Perhaps we are missing some distinct locale information here?</div>

I mean, people do not tend to keep their idea of time using this scale, rather they record the day of the month, and when they need the weeknumber they look at the calendar.<br><br>Of course, a lot of people record the oddness of the week number; but I do not believe they are interested in the number per se (and I also see they often paint the wall calendars...)<br><br>Note this is my view from Western Europa, where week numbers are not overused: the main use of them are for production control, and there a lot of numbers (ultimately related with computers, of course) invade our lives anyway.</div>

So far as i know, most countries have &quot;culturally accepted&quot; scheme of week numbers, in the sense that week numbering is not something that kids are taught in school when the calendar is explained. <br><br>Every week numbering scheme has the same basic problem: weeks don't fit precisely into years. If we want to have &quot;full weeks&quot; only (no week number splits in mid-week), we will have weeks 52 or 53 that extend into the next year, or we have a week 1 that extends into the former year.<br><br>Every week numbering scheme is to some extent arbitrary, and there exists no obviously correct solution: there are at least two possibly &quot;first days&quot; in a week (sunday/monday), and the first week can be defined to be the first &quot;full week&quot; or the first week that is &quot;mostly&quot; in the new year (the iso definition), so we end up with at least 4 different possibilities to define week numbers.<br><br>To summarize: the solution defined in iso 8601 is as good as any, and it is a standard formally accepted by most countries, so i would expect that major software supports it.<br><br>It always irks me to see software that doesn't support international time/date standards, but defaults to US-specific defaults that are not used anywhere else in the world (especially 12-hour times and the am/pm convention that is utterly error-prone at noon and midnight, but thats a different topic).<br></div>

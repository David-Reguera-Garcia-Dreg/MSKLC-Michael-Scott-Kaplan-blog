<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It started just the other day when John Jenkins asked on the core Unicode mailing list:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><EM><FONT size=2>Now that we have an uppercase glottal stop, any recommendations as to&nbsp;how it should look in a font?&nbsp; Both the uc and lc glottal stops&nbsp;occupy the full space from baseline to cap height, or so I've always&nbsp;understood it…</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>To which Peter Constable suggested:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><EM>He he he... This is the same matter I raised several months ago.</EM></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><EM>A slight clarification to what you wrote: the orthographic bicameral glottal stops used by some Athabaskan languages are x height and cap height. The caseless glottal stop used in phonetic transcription is cap height -- identical to the orthographic uppercase.</EM></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><EM>Well, the matter has temporarily ‎gotten slightly more complex: last week, UTC approved the addition of LATIN SMALL LETTER GLOTTAL STOP as the x-height case pair to 0241 (tentatively assigned to 0242). If this is accepted in WG2, then it would likely go in amendment 3, meaning post the next version of Unicode. So, if you are creating fonts *now* to support TUS4.1, you can choose between:</EM></FONT></FONT></P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><EM>having identical glyphs for 0294 and 0241, anticipating a later addition of the lowercase pair to 0241; </EM></FONT></FONT>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><EM>you can innovate a distinction between glyphs for 0294 and 0241 (e.g. make 0241 slightly wider); or,</EM></FONT></FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><EM>don't support 0241 until you can also support 0242.</EM></FONT></FONT></LI></UL>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><EM>Another logical option consistent with TUS4.1 would be to make 0294 x height, but I'd strongly advise against that, as it likely won't be consistent with a future version of the standard, and would not work for phonetic transcription, which will likely be relevant to a larger number of Apple customers than the orthographic usage.</EM></FONT><BR></P></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Ken Whistler's response was perhaps a little more cynical, though accurate as usual!</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><EM>Ah, John, you arrive right on time with the first set of misconceptions about what is going on.</EM></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><EM>What happened last week is that a *lowercase* glottal stop was added, invalidating the relationship between the Unicode 4.1 *uppercase* glottal stop and the erstwhile glottal stop, and returning the erstwhile glottal stop to glorious *un*cased status. (See my data file message from yesterday.)</EM></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><EM>So now we need *3* glyphs for glottal stops.</EM></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><EM>First we have the *real* glottal stop, U+0294, used in most orthographies without case.</EM></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><EM>It started out as a tiny hook, grew to the top half of a question mark to accomodate linguists filing the dots off their typewriters to be able to type the thing. It grew further, under the auspices of the IPA, into a taller and taller glyph, in a largely vain attempt to convince Europeans that "nothing" could be a *real* letter -- merely by making it so big they could no longer ignore its appearance in text.</EM></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><EM>Then the Chipewyan, Dogrib, and Slavey communities in NW Canada, aided and abetted by linguists who should have known better, invented a case pair for glottal stop. And because IPA had turned the thing into a monumental cap form in their effort to get people to take it seriously, the Dene decided, quite reasonably, that that monstrosity *was* a capital letter, and so invented a tinier version to be their normal glottal stop -- the lowercase one in running text.</EM></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><EM>In actual samples of Chipewyan and Dogrib texts using the case pair, the distinction is basically between a cap-height capital glottal stop and an x-height small glottal stop, otherwise of the same shape. I don't know of any systematic way to distinguish their cap-height capital glottal stop from what we now have as a caseless U+0294 glottal stop -- because, frankly, I don't think that issue ever occurred to the people who were using it and creating fonts for it.</EM></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><EM>Michael Everson has stepped in, in L2/05-194, with an attempt to make a 3-way glyphic distinction. But I consider the shapes for U+0241 and U+0242 (the uc/lc pair) to be typographic fantasizing. We now have a LATIN CAPITAL LETER GLOTTAL STOP that has grown "fatter" in another vain attempt to convince&nbsp;people it is a *real* letter and to be systematically distinguished from an ordinary glottal stop.</EM></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><EM>Oh well. Take L2/05-194 for what it is worth. That is the font that is likely to go into the book to confuse future generations further. Now, basically because typographic inflation and casepair invention has still not convinced Europeans that glottal stops are real -- we have embarked down the road of multiplying the encoding of them. Perhaps by the time we have encode 7 more glottal stops (in addition to U+0241, U+0242, U+0294, U+02BC,&nbsp;U+02BE, U+02C0, and U+097D) we'll finally manage to convince people to take it seriously. :-(</EM></FONT></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Ken further responded, to Peter's post:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><EM>&gt; If this is accepted in WG2, then it would likely go in amendment 3,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<BR>It *must* go in Amendment 2. The whole point of the rush on their lowercase pairs for uppercase characters is because the door slams shut on casefolding stability issues as of Unicode 5.0.</EM></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><EM>&gt; meaning post the next version of Unicode. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^</EM></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><EM>meaning Unicode 5.0.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR><BR>&gt; Another logical option consistent with TUS4.1 would be to make&nbsp;0294 x height, but I'd strongly advise against that, </EM></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><EM>As would I. You might as well go with the fantasy, Big 'N Tall uppercase glottal stop to convince people for TUS 4.1 that it is the appropriate uppercase for U+0294, and then leave Ol' Fat Boy there in your font when you add the x-height U+0242<BR>for Unicode 5.0 as the actual lowercase for it.</EM></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><EM>--Ken</EM></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><EM><FONT size=2><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face="Times New Roman">Oh, and since you asked -- no, I'm not bitter at all about this </FONT></FONT><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face="Times New Roman">travesty. ;-)</FONT></FONT></FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Michael Everson agreed with this last assessment:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><EM><FONT size=2>&gt; then it would likely go in amendment 3, meaning post the next version of Unicode.</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT size=2>No, it has to go into the FPDAM2 because of the case-folding stability lockdown.</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT size=2>&gt;- you can innovate a distinction between glyphs for 0294 and 0241 (e.g. make 0241 slightly wider); or,</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT size=2>I do this. The width of the footstem for 0241 should be the width of&nbsp; a capital I; the width of 0294 should be the width of a small i.</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Though he did differ from some of Ken's opinions:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><EM><FONT size=2>&gt;returning the erstwhile glottal stop to glorious *un*cased status.</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT size=2>Which is the way it is used in IPA and in other Canadian&nbsp; orthographies: as an uncasing character ignored e.g. in title casing.</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT size=2>&gt;...convince Europeans that "nothing" could be a *real* letter -- merely by making it so big they could no longer ignore its appearance in text.</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT size=2>I don't know why you are picking on Europeans, Ken.</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT size=2>&gt;Then the Chipewyan, Dogrib, and Slavey communities in NW Canada, aided and abetted by linguists who should have known better, invented a case pair for glottal stop.</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT size=2>Case-pairing is a perfectly natural thing for people to want to do,&nbsp;and it is no surprise that people did this, and I for one don't find it as distasteful as Ken does.<BR><BR>&gt;And because IPA had turned the thing into a monumental cap form in their effort to get people to take it seriously, the Dene decided, quite reasonably, that that monstrosity *was* a capital letter, and so invented a tinier version to be their normal glottal stop -- the lowercase one in running text.</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT size=2>But of course the UTC decided that 0294 could not be turned from Ll to Lu, which is why 0241 was added as Lu, but this caused the problems that L2/05-194 identifies and addresses.</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT size=2>&gt;Michael Everson has stepped in, in L2/05-194, with an attempt to make a 3-way glyphic distinction. But I consider the shapes for U+0241 and U+0242 (the uc/lc pair) to be typographic fantasizing. We now have a LATIN CAPITAL LETER GLOTTAL STOP that has grown "fatter" in another vain attempt to convince people it is a *real* letter and to be systematically distinguished from an ordinary glottal stop.</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT size=2>Capital letters should have the same vertical weights. I, T, Y, and&nbsp;the capital glottal have stems which should be cap width. 0294 should have the same width as l and i. This is pretty easy, really.</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And of course Michael had to respond to Ken's postscript:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><EM><FONT size=2>&gt;Oh, and since you asked -- no, I'm not bitter at all about this travesty. ;-)<BR><BR>We've only ended up encoding what SIL asked for in the first instance, based on what was Peter's correct analysis. What was accepted by UTC then was an overunification, and that's had to be corrected now. Sorry if that smarts.</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>John Jenkins responded to part of Ken's post, adding the ideographic point of view to all of this:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><EM>&gt; ...we'll finally manage to convince people&nbsp;to take it seriously. :-(<BR><BR>Nah, we'll have to wait until there is an isomorphism between glottal&nbsp; stops, middle dots, turtles, and grass radicals.&nbsp; :-)</EM></FONT></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Ken had to respond to Michael Everson's post about Europeans (just as Michael had to respond to Ken's!):</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><EM><FONT size=2>&gt; I don't know why you are picking on Europeans, Ken.</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT size=2>Because it was the Spanish, English, Portuguese, French, and the Dutch, with their impoverished, Latin-based writing systems, who colonized the Americas, Michael.</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT size=2>At least if the Arabs had colonized the Americas instead of the Western Europeans, they would have recognized (and written) a glottal stop when they heard one. On the other hand, then we'd probably be arguing about how to encode the 7 dots above and below the LAM needed for writing an ejective lateral affricate in these languages. :-(</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Rick McGowan&nbsp;had some fun with John's foray into ideographs:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT size=2><EM>&gt; Nah, we'll have to wait until there is an isomorphism between&nbsp;glottal stops, middle dots, turtles, and grass radicals. :-)<BR><BR>Oh! oh! Look what I just found... The rare "Spotted Vegetarian Turtle Stop"...</EM></FONT></P>
<P><EM><FONT size=2>[MK -- picture not posted here in the blog, but it was pretty funny]</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>To which Benson Margulies responded:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">

<P><EM><FONT size=2>&gt;Hmm. A mark turtle stop?<BR><BR>A mo' tur'le sto'.</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Michael then responded to Ken's European qualification:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><EM><FONT size=2>&gt;Because it was the Spanish, English, Portuguese, French, and the Dutch, with their impoverished, Latin-based writing systems, who colonized the Americas, Michael.</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT size=2>Pity the Finns didn't take UPA with them.</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Peter responded to the theorizing about colonizing of the Americas with an interesting thought...</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><EM><FONT size=2>Hmmm... There are Korean linguists who think that Hangul would do at least as good a job as Latin as a script that can be adapted to any transcription or orthographic need. So, what if the Koreans had colonized the Americas? I guess we'd be re-opening debates about Hangul encoding models.</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>To which Michael Everson responded:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><EM><FONT size=2>Yeah... we only have three.</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Thomas Milo had a little fun with Peter's notion, too...</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">

That would have happened anyway, if Charles Martel at Poitiers AD 732 had lost the battle against the Muslim raider Abd-ar-Rahman ibn-Abdullah al-Ghafiqi. As a result, many European languages, including our own, might have been written with Arabic letters ever since and look today like medieval Spanish or 19th century Bosnian Croato-Serbian.</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>What have we learned? Well, that the glottal stop is harder than we thought it would be. For me, native speaker of no language that has a glottal stop, who thinks of it as looking like punctuation, it is even harder to imagine. Like a lowercase question mark or something. I guess that's why my thoughts of linguistic aptitude are just delusions....</FONT></P>

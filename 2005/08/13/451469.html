<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Dawn asked me:</FONT></P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><EM>Hiya, well I am not up on all this bumph, but i was wondering if you could help me at all?? the problem is that when ever i try to type a pound sign this is what i get # so then when i try the oppisite and us the hash key to get a pound sign this is what i get |( with shift key)\ ( without shift key) its as though it has a mind of its own, any suggestions please Dawn</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE></FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Regular readers here will probably immediately think (as I did) that Dawn is typing on a keyboard supposing that the characters painted on the faces of the keys are always the same as what gets typed, even though <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/01/21/357960.html">we all know this supposition to be false</A>.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>In&nbsp;Dawn's case&nbsp;the solution might be to change the (software) keyboard layout to the UK layout or another one with the keystrokes that are desired....</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>(nothing technical here, sorry!)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I have <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/05/04/414514.html">posted</A> about Aimee Mann's new album The Forgotten Arm; She is actually touring now on the West coast and I got to see some shows....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>She appeared </FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>Saturday, July 6th at South Lake Union Park in Seattle, WA to do a show. This was going to be a landmark show since Cathy was going to go (I am not sure if she and Kevin were there, I did not see them. But I am hopeful that they were able to be there!).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Anyway, before the show I was kicking back with John Stewart (there to take pictures, he is Aimee's photographer) and Teresa (there to see the show), when a woman walks up and asks if I am "the Unicode guy"....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I tell her maybe, cautiously (I was worried about a joke punchline, I guess? Silly of me, in retrospect).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>She goes on to say that she reads the blog every day, and mentions some of the things she likes, like the character 'sponsorship' of posts. I think this my first official proof of overlap between people who read this blog and&nbsp;people who like to see Aimee Mann perform (other than me or perhaps inspired by me), which is&nbsp;a very cool thing in my opinion.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Hi Elizabeth, you made my night on Saturday, thanks!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Other highlights include:</FONT></P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>a cool venue setup with a special 'VIP' platform for people with scooters and wheelchairs. Anybody looking for me would have a relatively easy time, and I got to see the whole show;</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>a great opening act (<A href="http://www.kathleenedwards.com/">Kathleen Edwards</A>) who&nbsp;referred to me as her&nbsp;"Street Team connection" on the CD she signed after we had a conversation about how I ended up at so many concerts,&nbsp;and who also signed a poster for me the next night;</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>a&nbsp;great moment where security almost busted someone who they thought was using a camera. It turned out he was using binoculars, and Kathleen wondered why the f*** he needed binoculars -- <EM>he was in the second row</EM>!</FONT></LI><FONT face=Tahoma>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>a really great show that rocked the&nbsp;park, with an awesome encore that included part of a song not performed live in years (It's Not Safe);</FONT></LI>
<LI>a magical night where a huge piece of the crowd all got up and crowded in front of the stage. The band loved it!</LI>
<LI>a chat with Aimee's guitar player&nbsp;<A href="http://www.juliancoryell.net/">Julian Coryell</A>&nbsp;and found out that the version of his very cool album (<A href="http://stores.musictoday.com/store/dept.asp?dept%5Fid=1950&amp;band%5Fid=577&amp;sfid=2">Rock Star</A>) has two extra songs on it that are not present on the commercial version&nbsp;since it was from the original batch he had done before United Musicians got involved -- which just shows the benefits of buying the CD early and from the artist at a show!</LI>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>an awesome conversation over drinks between John, Teresa, myself, and John Sands (Aimee's drummer, who also wrote a really nice note on a CD he signed for me);</FONT></LI></FONT></UL>

If it's a question of medical fitness it looks like you have already done your due diligence. <br>On a side note, can you write a post about why they put Klingon and Elvish etc into Unicode, and how this works for other alien and made-up races? At the concert, my dh asked &quot;what's unicode&quot; and I could offer him only - it's the replacement for ASCII, and it's expandable to all human and some non-human languages. Being a game developer, he drilled down into the nonhuman and that's where my &quot;knowledge&quot; fell short.</div>
<p><a id="449019" href="#449019">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 8 Aug 2005 11:58 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Actually, the questions you raise are interesting ones, I think I will cover them soon.<br><br>FWIW, the Klingon proposal was rejected; the Elvish scripts have not yet been accepted or rejected (but are still on the roadmap). I'll talk about some of these things in the post....<br><br>Like I said, you made my night. Very cool to be recognized in such a situation!</div>

Save a lot of trouble in the future...</div>
<p><a id="449225" href="#449225">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 8 Aug 2005 7:20 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">The actual Unicode guy wouldn't be me though -- it might be Mark Davis -- president of Unicode Corp. snd even has a CA vanity plate that says UNICODE. :-)</div>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Someone pointed the following out to me in a contact post:</FONT></P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT size=2>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman"><EM>It is likely you have already heard about this before and either already tried it or perhaps dismissed it as bunk, but - talking about your Multiple Sclerosis with my girlfriend, she remembered we saw, not so long ago, a documentary about honey bee venom therapy for MS on TV. The channel was Animal Planet, and the segment was about a woman in her twenties or thirties who got hit by MS. Apparently, her health improved a lot after she started honey bee therapy - previously she was already hardly able to walk and then after months of treatment regained that capability, and her health is much better in general. The main thing that helps her, apparently, is the about 20 bees her therapist stings her with every day. Of course she didn't start with 20 but built up to that figure gradually...</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman"><EM>Now, I'm not sure how much you believe this kind of stuff, but if you do a search on Google you will find things, and besides, if of course you're not allergic to bees, it might make sense to try some things you haven't tried before starting that max-6-doses-in-a-lifetime chemotherapy. Just a thought.</EM></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE></FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I can honestly say that there are many unconventional therapies such as <A href="http://www.mult-sclerosis.org/Apitherapy.html">apitherapy</A>&nbsp;(bee strings), rattle snake venom, and other unusual treatment options. I won't insult the people who swear by these things, but they are not really for me....</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma color=#ff0000><EM><STRONG>WARNING</STRONG>&nbsp;- a least one regular reader of this blog has told me that this post contains TMI (too much information). If you are easily offended, you probably shouldn't read this post -- on the other hand if you're easily offended, you probably shouldn't read this blog!)</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>This is something I learned back in kindergarten finger painting, and&nbsp;<A href="http://www.glad.com/products/food.htm">Glad bags</A> have had the slogan for many years.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But today, I got to see it firsthand in a way that I have never seen it before....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>You see, I received my first Novantrone infusion today. All I can say is that this is a very very blue drug. Like blue enough to make the sky feel self-conscious about its color.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>A little while ago, I went to the bathroom. Yada, yada, yada and without further ado I can verify via the equation in the title that the Novantrone is in my system. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Getting the infusion done was a little bit of an adventure, mainly because the nurse practitioner had suggested that I should show up an hour in advance but by the time they started the infusion were running an hour behind. I was spending a little more time there than I wanted to, a pill made no less bitter by the fact that the Auto-Pay system did not recognize the parking validation and I was charged $24 for the time I was parked.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Ah well, no biggie. From now on, if they still haven't fixed the elevator to the third-floor from the Triangle garage, I'll just use the valet parking....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Feeling good so far, and I haven't checked the whites in my eyes to see if they're still white. Maybe I should ask somebody, if I can figure out a way to ask without sounding really really strange or like I'm using some type of pickup line!</FONT></P>

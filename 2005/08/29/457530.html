<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Philipp Lensen explained </FONT><A href="http://blog.outer-court.com/archive/2005-08-24-n14.html"><FONT face=Tahoma>Why Good Programmers Are Lazy and Dumb</FONT></A><FONT face=Tahoma>. I thought this was a great and funny post, made even funnier by a small piece in the middle:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT size=2><EM>In the endless battle between a programmer and the compiler, it’s best for the programmer to give up early and admit that it’s always him and never the compiler who’s at fault (unless it’s about character encoding issues, which is the part even the compiler gets wrong).</EM></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Like the line in the movie said, we laugh because it's funny, and we laugh because it's true. Compilers often get this bit wrong, but in fairness to the compiler it is usually the programmer's fault and the compiler is just following orders when if it knew better it would know to put up an error.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Things are getting better for languages like C# and VB.NET, which are moving to Unicode. But no one is quite there yet, something that I will be blogging about soon.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>In the meantime, enjoy the article, it is pretty accurate and reminds me of the story of "The Man Who Was Too Lazy to Fail" from a Heinlein novel I enjoyed years back....</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma><EM>(nothing technical here, at least not for computers -- if the MS thing doesn't interest you then you may want to skip this one)</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I did lift and modify the title quote from the movie <A href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0106356/">Barbarians at the Gate</A>. George Roberts (played by Peter Dvorsky) is talking with Henry Kravis (well played by Jonathan Pryce) just after a meeting where they were stonewalled. The clock is ticking, and time is running out. So George asks the question and Henry makes clear that a slash and burn strategy is called for.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>A great movie that I enjoy a lot, and a scene that has been running through my head a lot over the last few days, which have had some fairly huge distractions....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I had an unusual appointment with my neurologist on Monday (I think I had already mentioned that it was a fairly odd day, professionally). We were talking about recent declines in my MS that did not seem related to a specific clinical&nbsp;exacerbation. Now this is a disturbing trend, any way you look at it. If you want to reverse these things and not have them stay as permanent deficits, you have to act quickly.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But the options for acting are limited -- there are just not very many conventional treatments available, and as unconventional as some people believe me to be, I am about as likely to start the snake oil rounds as I am to sprout wings and fly to Guam. </FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>I certainly am not going to jump into the exciting world of stem cell research. There is just not a lot out there....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So my neurologist made a very responsible suggestion -- that it may be time to think about Novantrone.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Now <A href="http://www.novantrone.com/">Novantrone</A> is pretty much the napalm of the MS world -- an antineoplastic agent (basically chemotherapy), and you can watch how much the official site for the drug tries to tap dance about how much milder the drug is when used for MS than for cancer (whoever decided it was okay to sell it under the same brand name rather than a different one was not thinking too clearly that day, if you ask me).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But even though it is the napalm treatment, it is pretty much one of the only treatment options that really exist for what they like to euphamstically call "worsening MS". It is the sort of thing I had already learned a lot about because I have a morbid fascination for such things. The party line about <A href="http://www.novantrone.com/patients/novantrone/how_it_works.jsp">how it works</A> is pretty harsh, even after the spin doctors have had their way with it:</FONT></P><FONT face=Tahoma>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><EM>Novantrone works differently from other MS drugs This difference provides hope for people who have experienced worsening symptoms of MS while getting other treatments.</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><EM>Other drugs used to treat MS (like interferon) "moderate" the immune system. You can think of it as "calming down" certain immune cells, but not completely reducing their numbers.</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><EM>Novantrone works by "suppressing" the immune system. The active substance in Novantrone (called mitoxantrone) affects DNA, a basic building block of all cells. You can think of Novantrone as killing certain cells in the immune system (called T cells, B cells, and macrophages). These are the cells thought to become abnormal and lead the attack on the </EM></FONT><FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#000000 size=2><EM>myelin sheath</EM></FONT><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><EM>â€”producing the brain or spinal </EM></FONT><FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#000000 size=2><EM>lesions</EM></FONT><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><EM> characteristic of MS.</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><EM>You may hear the term chemotherapy associated with Novantrone. For some people, the word "chemotherapy" triggers scary images. However, the word simply means using chemicals to treat disease.</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><EM>When used to fight cancer, chemotherapy drugs are given in doses that are strong enough to kill aggressively-growing tumor cells.</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><EM>However, when Novantrone is used to treat MS the goal is to inactivate or destroy any immune cells that are "misguided." When Novantrone is prescribed by a doctor for MS, the recommended treatment schedule is far less intensive than for cancer. The overall dosage is given less frequently over a longer period of time.</EM></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE></FONT>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Well, okay. But the list of side effects are the same, the worries about the potentially destructive effect on the heart is in there, the small (less than 1%) chance of getting leukemia is present, and the fact that the effects can still be a worry years after you have stopped the treatment is sobering. The <A href="http://www.novantrone.com/assets/pdf/novantrone_patient_info.pdf">Patient Information Leaflet</A> goes into the amusing under any other circumstances things like&nbsp;blue-green urine and&nbsp;the whites of the eyes turning blue. Some of the other <A href="http://www.novantrone.com/patients/novantrone/risks/index.jsp">risks</A> are also interesting....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But the fact that hits me hardest is not even one of the side effects -- it is that this drug has a <STRONG>lifetime maximum dosage</STRONG> of somewhere around 8-12 doses.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>This is where that morbid fascination thing kicks in -- a drug with such long-term destructive potential that there is not just a daily or weekly maximum but an actual maximum over the period of a lifetime.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Wow. Or whatever the negative version of the word 'Wow' is.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Am I really doing that badly?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Of course that is the problem, and that is why&nbsp;it might be the right&nbsp;thing to try -- because I am not doing so badly that this would be a useless idea; it may well be the perfect time to knock this monkey off my back for a little, try to unseat the mostly unfettered ascendency of multiple sclerosis a bit.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The other problem is a psychological one -- when the MS was not affecting me as much, I was in denial and everyone would go on about how great my attitude was and what a great example I was setting (and <EM>everyone</EM> has a friend or relative who is doing worse than I am). But now that it is affecting me and I finally may be reaching a more real and healthy attitude, a lot of people don't know what to do with me and have trouble thinking of me as&nbsp;setting a great&nbsp;example for anybody.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I used to think that just about everything I ever needed to know I learned from the movie <A href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0078788/">Apocalypse Now</A>&nbsp;(yes, many will find that to be disturbing!), but this time Coppola failed me -- despite Robert Duvall's memorable Kilgore quote, I am not loving the smell of <EM>this</EM> napalm in the morning.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>On the other hand, I am finding comfort in Captain Willard's (Martin Sheen's) words, modified for this situation. "<EM>I took the Novantrone consult. What the hell else was I going to do? But I really didn't know what I'd do when I found if&nbsp;it was right.</EM>" </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So we'll see what happens.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>This post may not have been everyone's cup of tea, so I am sorry for that. But it is hard for me to completely separate the various pieces of my life since they are all me, in the end. One way or another I do have to sort it all out....</FONT></P>

The unfortunate side of that is that of course AIDS is a much more deadly disease than most of the ones that it would &quot;cure&quot;. A lot of immunosupression stuff resembles AIDS (in fact, some of the opportunistic infections that most commonly affect people with AIDS were prior to AIDS seen mainly in cases of immunosupression).</div>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>You would think that I would need to go no further than <A href="http://dictionary.com/">dictionary.com</A> to find out the meaning of the word <STRONG><A href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=unsupported">unsupported</A></STRONG>:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><EM><FONT size=2>adj 1: not sustained or maintained by nonmaterial aid; "unsupported accusations" [ant: </FONT></EM><A href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=supported"><FONT color=#0033ff size=2><EM>supported</EM></FONT></A><EM><FONT size=2>] <BR>2: not held up or borne; "removal of the central post left the roof unsupported" [ant: </FONT></EM><A href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=supported"><FONT color=#0033ff size=2><EM>supported</EM></FONT></A><EM><FONT size=2>] <BR>3: not supported by written evidence; "unsupported accusations"</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>When one is referring to software, you could say that perhaps definition #2 is closest. But no one could doubt what you mean.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Well, I would have thought so.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>In a past life, I was a consultant. And I did a lot of troubleshooting, and had to write a whole bunch of code. Now usually I did not bother trying to own the code since it was only useful in some specific situation anyway, but other times it would be generic tools or components that I would be using over and over again. I would not charge people the cost of developing the tool or code over and over again, but I would consider the time savings to be a benefit to being able to do the job faster.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>A bunch of times&nbsp;I would take code samples and utilities&nbsp;that were generic enough for other people to use. Other times I would write stuff that I really wanted to see out in the wild and I would put it up there too. Occasionally, I would not have time to do the work on something that I really wanted to see out there, so I would pay someone else to do it. Occasionally I would post the hard work of some other developer in explaining a particular issue. I would put these things up on <A href="http://trigeminal.com/">trigeminal.com</A>&nbsp;for the common good, and with a simple principle -- they are all free, but they are also all unsupported.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I cannot claim I did this most of the time to even drum up consulting jobs, because I already had way more than&nbsp; I could handle anyway. Such requests usually had to be politely turned down.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>All of this was certainly not to be mean, but it was to help make sure that a (mostly) one-man company would not be bogged down in support requests for anything upon which&nbsp;I make no money.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Seems like a simple enough idea, right?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I even post it on the download page:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4><STRONG>All of the utilities here are <FONT color=#000000>free</FONT> and will always be <FONT color=#000000>free</FONT> <BR>however, they are <FONT color=#000000>unsupported</FONT>. That's the nature of <FONT color=#000000>free</FONT> tools.</STRONG> </FONT></P><FONT face=Tahoma>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It turns out that in the software world and today's internet, if you put out something that is "free, but unsupported" then most people assume that the definition is:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><EM><FONT size=2>supported for answering specific questions or fixing specific problems or adding specific features, for free, where 'specific' is defined as 'something <STRONG>I</STRONG> need'</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE></FONT>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>There is not a week that goes by that I do not get between 5 and 20 requests for help debugging a problem or adding a feature or explaining a bug, at least one or two of which are <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/08/02/446637.html">this</A> problem (on the plus side, it has convinced me that the numbers they use to spout off about people who run MS Office in locked down corporate environments may be accurate; on the minus side, it is annoying to keep having to repeatedly answer the same question for something that is not my bug).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>From now on, I am going to point people at this blog post. Perhaps that is a bit snarky, and I'll apologize for that, to all of those who deserve a snark-free response.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But the majority of these mails are for utilities (and occasionally small VB/VBA code snippets) written 3-7 years ago for different versions of products than they are currently being run upon.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>They may work just fine and dandy. Or they may fail to work. If they do then I cannot promise that the Trigeminal Test team will work to verify the resport. I cannot guarantee that the Trigeminal Development Team will work to code the issue up. I cannot assure you that the Trigeminal Sustained Engineering Team will work to release a patched version or an update. I cannot pledge that the Trigeminal User Education Team will work to document this issue. And I cannot even ensure that the Trigeminal Product Support&nbsp;Team will be able to even answer the email that is sent in a timely manner (or even at all).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Because the Trigeminal Test team, Development Team, Sustained Engineering Team, User Education Team, and Product Support&nbsp;Team is me, and me alone.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>For the official record, here is a list of known issues off of the top of my head, to save some time:</FONT></P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>TSI Xpression does not work in Access 2003. I even know pretty much&nbsp;what the bug is (and fixed it once already for Access 2002), but the time to fix it and re-release it is unfortunately too high. One day this one may happen, though.</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Error messages about <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/08/02/446637.html">a problem adding to the registry</A>&nbsp;are not my fault -- talk to your administrator about the fact that they have locked down the registry on you. Or you can blame the Access team for not having a better error message, but that is something that can only be fixed in a new version so it will not help you anyway.</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>The Y2K Compliancy&nbsp;of Trigeminal utilities is thoroughly explained <A href="http://trigeminal.com/y2k.asp">here</A>.</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>I have no need for partnerships involving the selling of Rolexes or Viagra or textiles or making anything on anybody bigger; it is just not my line of country.</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Similar requests related to international lotteries my company has won, over-invoiced anythings, or any 419-type scams will be ignored, for similar reasons.</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>If I am allowed to give source for a utility, I have already given it. Otherwise I have agreed not to do so,&nbsp;due to the fact that the utility is calling internal, undocumented&nbsp;Access or Jet API functions and if you want source then you had better be willing to pay me (and indemnify me)&nbsp;enough to cover how much Microsoft will able to sue me for after they fire me for willfully violating the agreements I have made.</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Most of the utilities were written in VB code, as they were written during a&nbsp;time in&nbsp;my life where thumbing my nose at the "you can't do that in VB" crowd had a certain visceral appeal. I am unable to rewrite them for any other language as I do not have time to do so.</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>I have a fulltime job now, so even if you wanted to hire me and could pay an outrageous hourly rate I do not have time to do any of the above for you.</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>None of the DLLs or EXEs are signed with a Verisign-type certificate. And due to the expense and the time committent involved in that process, will probably not ever be.</FONT></LI></UL>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The utilities are there -- they are in fact the only way to do certain things:</FONT></P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Programatically create a Jet workgroup (MDW) file;</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Programatically convert an Access db between versions (there may be a way to do this now in the product);</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Programatically control the Jet Synchonizer for Replication, and perform many Jet replication tasks;</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Programatically launch the Access Expression Builder, or launch the Access Expression Builder from VBE;</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Convert a Microsoft Access form or report to a Data Access Page, including tab controls -- something they once offered me $12,000 for (I turned them down since I had to remove it from my site even for downlevel, and they had no plans for a downlevel solution);</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Remove the replication system fields from a formerly replicated Jet database;</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Specify the database where MS Access import/export specs are stored;</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Copy the MS Access relationship view between computers, databases, or users;</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT face=Tahoma>Programatically compact a Jet database with events to suppport a status bar for the operation;</FONT></LI></UL>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Then it is pretty much the only way -- they are all features that could be added to various products, but none of them ever have been, yet, for the most part.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>If you like 'em, use 'em. If not, then you can use something else. They are all free, though all unsupported -- and I can't really deal with email for them, anymore....</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I just read that it is National Punctuation Day.. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The US has some of the most unbelievably goddamndest freaking holidays here,, let me tell you..</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Anyway,, In honor of that special occasion,, every punctuation symbol I use appropriately in this post will be doubled..</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Where would we be without punctuation?? Well, I do not know where you would be.. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I would probably have been happier to not have to learn all those rules about punctuation.. But that is,, of course,, not the fault of the punctuation marks.. That is the fault of the English teachers who felt the need to grade me on these things..</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Maybe I should just say ""#$!%&amp; em..""</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>((that was an example of inappropriate usage!!))</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>One thing I have never understood about punctuation is what are the proper punctuation symbols to use when you are trying to simulate curse words??</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I swear that every time I do it,, what I do looks incorrect.. I wish I had a Mad Magazine around I could check,, because they always seemed to get it right..&nbsp;Does anyone know what the rules are??</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>((One rule I learned years ago was that you should never use the @ symbol in Word or in most editors, as they assume it is email address even if there is no way it can be.. But beyond that I never learned any real rules.. Are they any??</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Well,, in any case,, happy punctuation day,, everybody!!</FONT></P>

And a simple Ctrl-Z will take care of the annoying auto-link thing in Word.<br><br>What do you do on National Punctuation Day to people who use 's incorrectly (your/you're, its/it's, etc.)?</div>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The other day I was talking about <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/08/03/447149.html">Novantrone</A>. Well,&nbsp;I did not bring up this 'napalm of the MS world' first, my neurologist did. After some careful thought, I decided to go ahead with it. So I saw the NP, had some tests done and will be doing a few more this week. And if all goes well I'll be finding out if the whites of my eyes will have a bluish tinge for a few days.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Or, I could instead be inspired to hum Behind Blue Eyes, by the Who. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Also today, Yuriko (who runs the work for several of the drug studies that take place at the University of Washington for MS) was calling me today to find out whether I might qualify for a study. As I suspected, Novantrone will take me out of the running on that, too. I guess timing really is everything.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And then also on the unfortunate side of all of this, after a long journey to finally be able to donate blood (described previously in <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/06/24/432114.html">this</A> post), I am actually taking myself out of the running once again (there is no surer way to disqualify oneself than to&nbsp;be in any way immunosupressed!). But I do get to donate one more time (this week) at least!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I'll let you know how I feel after I have destructive chemicals infused. Seems like it ought to be a party....</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Yes, as it turns out, it has been exactly three years since I started at Microsoft on a full-time basis. And my dork badge still let me in so I have not been fired just yet.... :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Ordinarily, this would mean I should put out 3 lbs of M&amp;Ms in front of my office.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>However, since I did not do this the first two years, I am making up for that by putting in the 1 lb. for year one and 2 lbs. for year two as well. With a little extra for interest (well, actually because the bags were 21.30&nbsp;oz. in the store and I could not make it come out even, but why quibble?).</FONT></P>

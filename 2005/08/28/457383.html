<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2><EM>(Nothing but a bunch of navel gazing in this post, you may want to skip if you have a temperment like mine; I would have no patience for this type of rubbish, myself!)</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>A few days ago when I shook my fist at the heavens and proclaimed <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/08/25/456237.html">my kingdom for some Unicode controls</A>, I mentioned about how <A href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel Spolsky</A>&nbsp;said some incredibly nice things about my book, and even mused&nbsp;that "<EM>Hopefully we'll see another book on international software from him soon.</EM>"</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Well, I can honestly say that there is nothing planned at the&nbsp;moment.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Though I have noticed the best way to get publishers to woo me for such a thing is to go out in public and talk about international stuff, and being wooed (is that a word?) is flattering, I am finally smart enough at this point to know that it is a lot of work to write a book. Even&nbsp;if&nbsp;I have a lot of the material I would cover already figured out.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I have pretty much had a simple rule for as long as writing a book was ever a topic to discuss, one that I think I first said aloud to Sharon Cox and Brad Jones at a dinner meeting in San Fransisco in early 1999 during VBITS. The rule?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The rule is simple: <STRONG>I would never want to write a book that I wouldn't want to read.</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Sharon later became my acquisitions editor at Sams Publishing, maily on the basis of what went on in that meeting (well, that and the fact that folks at Wiley told me I would not be able to choose the animal for my book cover!). Of course Brad left Sams before my book was published and Sharon left soon after for Hungry Minds that was subsequently bought by Wiley, I think. How do editors and writers even know where to stand when the tectonic plates of the publishing world shift around so frequently? :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Anyway, the rule does not mean I would feel some morbid need to read the book later; it would serve no purpose, I probably know what it will say half the time.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>What the rule means is that unless it was the type of book that I would want to go into a book store and buy then I would not want to put it out there. Farnkly, there are way too many freaking books out there. And while there are some gems, there is also a lot of worthless crap out there, too. I wish more of the people who wrote books would just stop writing and spend some more time <EM>reading</EM> books. And articles. And documentation. Because what some of those people write just makes it harder to find the useful information!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><EM>(I have similar feelings about a lot of the technical blogs out there, for what it is worth -- I'll blog about that some other time)</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>When I wrote <A href="http://i18nwithvb.com/">Internationalization with Visual Basic</A>&nbsp;I had a bunch of years of consulting to draw on. And not just consulting for Microsoft, but for a lot of Microsoft customers, too. But in the time since then, I have not been doing nearly as much consulting, and therefore not nearly as much time looking at dozens of different projects and scenarios and helping people come up with solutions. I have mostly been working for one company, and while I have been working on projects that I loved, they are not the sort of thing you can write books about.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Hell, they are barely the sort of thing I can write blog posts about!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I&nbsp;think that any book I wrote now would be either (a) an insightful look into how to do international software on MS platforms, or (b) a rehash of what you could have gotten out of MSDN&nbsp;anyway.After seeing some of what the competition for the book is and will be and would be, I am reasonably certain I would come significantly closer to (a) then some of the others have on the grounds of accuracy,&nbsp;correct&nbsp;terminology,&nbsp;and scope of coverage alone.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But hell, I could probably give them&nbsp;a run for their money on that by just publishing this freaking blog (with this entry as the introduction!). Which is not saying this blog hs ever nearly all that I would want to cover; I am saying a lot more about their weaknesses than my strengths, believe me.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>If you listen to the interview that Joel did, he points out one of the problems I would run into if I wrote a book -- the people who enjoy slamming me in anonymous&nbsp;book site reviews for&nbsp;(in their opinion deserved) revenge or whatever, certainly do come out of the woodwork. One of those people even pretended to be a Microsoft employee&nbsp;(this one was taken down from amazon.com after the real person&nbsp;got in touch with them and asked them to take it down -- since the person who posted it was not smart enough to realize that their review was linked to his previous reviews, we even found out who he was!).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Anyway, it makes me realize that it is unlikely I could write something good enough to entirely escape this muck in which I have placed myself.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>This fact might rule out politics for me, too. Not that my unpopular political beliefs would get me elected anyway. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Now I was going to write another book for Sams called <STRONG>Internationalization with SQL Server</STRONG>. It had an ISBN (0-672-32099-1) and was not quite half written (8 chapters out of the 18 in the approved TOC!), but they decided not go with it (they paid off the advance plus a bit more for my troubles, so I am not entirely bitter about the whole thing). Of course that was nearly five years ago, so even what was done would need a major update to be relevant now. It would be easier to start over, probably. But not being an internationally recognized SQL Server expert would probably work against me and I would not have the just-published other&nbsp;book with a similar title from the same publisher to help, either.</FONT></P><FONT face=Tahoma>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And there was one great idea I had for a book and I even pitched it to my former acquisitions editor Sharon when she started working for Hungry Minds (when it was its own company). But it was a slightly radical idea and her boss said no, and none of the editors I have talked to since&nbsp;then have been interested either. So perhaps it was a little too radical (or maybe just a bad idea). Perhaps I'll blog about it some day and readers here can tell me if I was on track or on crack.</FONT></P>
<P>But I really can't look at other books that aren't getting it done as a source of inspiration to get it done myself. The book situation for internationalization in .NET is pretty bleak (and does not like it will be getting better any time soon), but I don't think I could tackle it <EM>and</EM> my job unless the book was a big part of the job while it was being written (which seems pretty unlikely in a product group that has too many projects and not enough resources as it is!).</P>
<P>For now,&nbsp;I feel a little safer here anyway,&nbsp;where "for great justice somebody set us up the blog" and all that. I'll keep covering the internationalization issues I know about, and try to strike a chord here and there. Plus talk about the music I like from time to time, which seems to also entertain folks....</P></FONT>

Both work well for conceptual issues but the first does more in the code and examples department. &lt;/P&gt;<br>&lt;P&gt;The Unicode book is available for purchase and online (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode4.1.0/">http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode4.1.0/</a>) and to get the full syory on the standard you need the various technical reports that are only available online. There is of course this blog. :-) &lt;/P&gt;<br>&lt;P&gt;There are other books out there, I just have trouble recommending a lot of the ones on Windows because there are usually real problems with them, in my opinion....&lt;/P&gt;</div>
<p><a id="457536" href="#457536">#</a> <strong>Mihai</strong> on 29 Aug 2005 12:38 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">I also think &quot;Developing International Software - 1st ed.&quot; is still somehow &quot;the book&quot;. There is nothing after it that I can say is good enough. You can also find it on some older MSDN CD (.chm), if you don't like the online format.<br>2nd edition is also good on &quot;how&quot;, if you get the basics and the &quot;why&quot; from the first one.<br>I always recomend them both, mentioning that the 2nd edition should really be 2nd volume.<br></div>

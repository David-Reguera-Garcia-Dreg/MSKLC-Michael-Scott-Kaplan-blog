<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Approximately 1.5 lives ago (or two to three versions of Office ago -- pick your own preferred meaurement method), I was something of a guru when it came to Jet replication -- for Jet 3.0x, 3.5x, and 4.0.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I was doing a lot of consulting for companies that amounted to salvaging data from replica sets with problems, training, helping people set stuff up right, and so on. All very quick, small jobs. I even wrote a whole bunch of tools -- for the fixing, for the training, for the long-term maintenance. And those tools were designed to call undocumented, exported functions from the Jet DLLs. I asked for and received permission to release some of these tools provided I did not charge for them (which was fine, I was not going to charge anyway).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>That is all background. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>One of the most important of these tools was the TSI Synchronizer, a programmatic replacement for Microsoft's Replication Manager (which has a user interface that many people found to be less than intuitive).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Now note what I said here&nbsp;-- it is a replacement for Replication Manager, and <STRONG>nothing else</STRONG>. It is not a replacement for the Jet Synchronizer, of the Jet Internet Synchronizer. You must have those items to do indirect an/or internet synchronizations. If you don't have them, you may find yourself unable to perform sync operations in any case where you need that synchronizer process running on your machine.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Now the Jet Synchronizer (which is packaged with the Microsoft Replication Manager), is not available currently, for reasons that I have not yet been able to completely fathom. It is a different set of people in a different group in a different division of Microsoft, and I am in no way offended that they do not check with me prior to making decisions. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But out in the newsgroups a bunch of people are reportedly claiming that the TSI Synchronizer is a replacement for the Jet Synchronizer, rather than a wrapper around it. Hopefully they can be pointed here so that they do not keep trying to make those claims....</FONT></P>

Is it possible to load it as a service on Windows XP/Windows 2000?

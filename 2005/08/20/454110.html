<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I have had a few people ask me for a little of the back story here....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>You see, track 9 of Aimee Mann's new album (The Forgotten Arm) is entitled 'That's How I Knew This Story Would Break My Heart' and the first verse goes something like this:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><EM><FONT size=2>I drew a picture of you<BR>You and your anchor tattoo<BR>And saw the face that I knew<BR>Covered in shame<BR>You drew a bird that was here<BR>A kind of sweet chanticleer<BR>But with a terrible fear<BR>That the cage couldn't tame</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT size=2>That's how I knew this story would break my heart<BR>When you wrote it</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT face=Tahoma>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>In the concept album, this is kind of a low point for our hero John and heroine Caroline, as the lyrics would kind of indicate -- they have gone their separate ways (several songs ago) and it looks kind of hopeless as a romance (things get a little&nbsp;better later, but clearly not in this song).</FONT></P>
<P>Anyway, it turns out that Aimee got a large anchor tattoo on her right arm. This was just before her show at the Fillmore last weekend&nbsp;(the tattoo was just 'one of the things she did' in San Fransisco that day, before the show).</P>
<P>She was wearing blue jeans and a white tank top, so it was hard to miss the tattoo (I was behind the curtain, stage left, so I only got a few glimpses of it, when she was turning to switch guitars between songs;&nbsp;people who were on the other side of her probably got a better view).</P>
<P>There was wide speculation that it was not real, but people have since then insisted that it is.</P>
<P>It was kind of hard to understand the purpose of getting the tattoo -- the song, which I did like,&nbsp;is not one that is in the regular set they have been doing during the tour, and by report is has only been performed once in all those shows. And it is hard to fit it in with the themes of the album when it is sitting on <EM>her</EM> arm, although the fact that she actually does some boxing now confuses roles a bit. Perhaps that is why she did it, although it seems like a pretty huge step -- much bigger than just wearing a jacket and tie to shows, as she has been known to do. But she has a different look now, during shows. And you can't change out of a tattoo, after all -- so what happens the next time the look changes?</P>
<P>On the other hand it is really not up to people who listen to music to understand everything the artists do, so that really is okay.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Now when I hear the song which was formerly one I liked&nbsp;a lot, wondering about the tattoo kind of distracts from the music itself (others have said the same thing, so I know it is not just me). Maybe it is to remind <EM>her</EM> of the song or some special meaning behind it, but maybe it is&nbsp;for the best&nbsp;that she is not playing at shows, certainly the ones she wears tank tops to!</FONT></P>

While in San Francisco she was inspired to do it.<br><br>Just my thoughts having been at the show...</div>

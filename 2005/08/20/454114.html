<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Some of you will remember a while back about when <A href="http://www.gregcons.com/kateblog/default.aspx">Kate Gregory</A> inspired me to talk about why sometimes <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/02/24/379466.html">the keyboard does not do what I tell it to!</A></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Sometimes you think you are typing in one keyboard, but it turns out you are typing in another.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So some of the truly awesome GIFT team folks in Ireland decided that maybe there was something better that could be done about the problem than just blogging about it.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Turns out they were right -- they created the <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=39AB89D4-06A9-4A68-8F8E-9020F47FB687&amp;displaylang=en">Keyboard Convert Service</A>, a free download that will do its darndest to fix the text in these cases!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I will be trying ot out this week to see if they were able to integrate some of the feedback I gave them early in the project cycle. :-)</FONT></P>

Why should I validate my genuine Window, download 268KB and install yet another service, when nobody told me how does this work?</div>
<p><a id="454206" href="#454206">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 21 Aug 2005 12:28 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Hi Pavel --<br><br>It is of course your choice if you do not wish to do so. But I just described what its intended purpose is. So if you want an add-in that will try to correct the mistake when text was typed using the wrong keyboard, then you may want to install it and give it a try.<br><br>Ignoring WGA issues, I think anyone who downloads and tries things without understanding why they are there or what they might do is bored and looking for something to do. So when I think of WGA in those cases, you just need to decide how bored you are!<br><br>In the case where you know what the download purports to do, the potential value is obvious and understood.</div>

When you are writing in Greek (I suppose in other languages as well), it's extremely easy to forget pressing Alt-Shift and typing Γρεεκ (Greek) where you should be typing Ενγλιση (English). And, unlike some word macro that Microsoft Hellas had included in some old Greek Word version, this works in *every* program (except console applications) and it takes into account dead keys! Thank you!</div>
<p><a id="454546" href="#454546">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 22 Aug 2005 11:52 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Indeed, very cool, George.<br><br>And the dead key support was my idea (they had assumed it was impossible, but I explained how we get the info in MSKLC and they must have decided to integrate it!).<br><br>:-)</div>

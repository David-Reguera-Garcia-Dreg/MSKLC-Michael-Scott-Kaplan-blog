<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I was explaining the other day about how I thought <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/06/10/427692.html">Gretchen is totally cool</A>.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I then went on to suggest that even ignoring Gretchen the person (who is cool for the reasons given and more), there is a conceptual coolness related to her job here as well. Let me explain....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>You see, it goes back to when I was growing up.&nbsp; </FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>My father was the Vice President and Managing Tax Officer of&nbsp;a large bank.&nbsp; In my young mind the idea that there were&nbsp;a ton of vice presidents was foreign to me, as was the fact that in a bank it is the vice presidents in charge of things like loans that have the actual power.&nbsp; All I knew was that if the president died (or there was some kind of coup), that my father would be the president.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>That just kept me going on for&nbsp;a long time about the whole situation.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And how does this relate to Gretchen, and her friend/colleague Jen, and others?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Well, they work in Human Resources (HR). So if I am going to lunch with one or more of them and someone asks me if I want to go to lunch, I can say "sorry, I have to lunch with some HR people" or "sorry, i have to meet with some folks in HR".&nbsp; Now of course people will assume that I am not talking about recruiting but insteas the other, more serious aspects of HR and if I pretend to be a little freaked out then they will even be worried.&nbsp; The same way that I had it in my head that I had a family member in a bank's line of succession, they will think that there is some serious issue going on.&nbsp; Even though it is just lunch.&nbsp; :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Silly?&nbsp;Yes.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But it is pretty amusing to me, and kind of cool, conceptually.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Or maybe I just need to get out more. ;-)</FONT></P>

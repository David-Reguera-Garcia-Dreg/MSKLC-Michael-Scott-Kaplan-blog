<P><FONT face=Tahoma><STRONG><A href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2142263&amp;CMP=OTC-DT9705204233">Marlins suspend batboy for milk-drinking dare</A></STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I'll ignore the suspension issue and talk about the "milk bet" here.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Now this particular bet has been around for a long time. I first heard about it when I was working for the Access team, probably around eight years ago.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Heath, a fellow developer on the team with an office right next door to mine, was certain that he could drink a gallon of milk in an hour without throwing up. He went to CalTech and because of this had a very logical way of thinking this through. He could easily drink one of those one pint milk containers in just a few minutes. So the gallon could be polished off easily since it really is just eight of those one pint containers.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>(for those outside the US, there are four quarts to a gallon and two pints to a quart!)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And he had a whole hour to do it, so he could take his time and make it with no problem, right?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Well, actually, it is wrong.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Fellow developer Nicholas Shulman volunteered the explanation for why the bet is never won as Heath was running to the restroom to avoid throwing up in the conference room to which we had all adjourned.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>"<EM>A stomach,</EM>" Nick explained with the just the right inflection for irony, "<EM>is about a half a gallon.</EM>"</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Milk needs time in the stomach to be broken down before it can go on -- it does a body good, but it needs a little time to <EM>do</EM> that good. And there is simply no way to break the milk down fast enough to take in a full gallon in an hour. If you try to do so, your body will rebel and if you try and force the issue, your stomach will settle the argument for you.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Perhaps some future CalTech or MIT student <STRONG>who has read this blog</STRONG> will either refuse the bet, or anticipatorily&nbsp;buy something that will break down the milk and drink a bunch of that right before the bet starts.</FONT></P>

Only:<br><br>&gt; (for those outside the US, there are four quarts to a gallon and two pints to a quart!)<br><br>Given that you mention in the line above that there are eight pints to a galleon, that must be the most useless explanation for &quot;those outside the US&quot; I've ever seen. You've added no new information except introducing yet another mysterious unit, the quart.<br>Thanks to Mike Dunn for offering something that actually helps.</div>

In addition to the hour time limit there was the incentive to be the first one done.  We made a big production of it in the dorm hall and we were prepared with 2 large trashcans.  One of the three actually quit before reaching the point of no return, drank about two thirds of the gallon.  The other two finished their gallons but not before emptying their stomachs a few times.  I'm not sure about the wisdom of recording it all on VHS but the tape is still a part of my collection.</div>

It doesn't matter how many SI units a gallon is.  He was merely trying to put gallons and pints in perspective so that the pint reference makes sense.  1 equals 8.  I don't think it was his intention to give the SI world a means of exact quantification.<br><br>A gallon is 1 unit.  A pint is 0.125 units.  A stomach is 0.5 units.  All the information needed to enjoy the post is in there.<br><br>I don't mean to feed the flames...  Like CornedBee, sometimes I don't know when to shut up.<br><br>Thanks for the post, Kaplan.</div>

I just meant to point out that the remark was about as helpful as if I invented my country (CornedCountry) and my own units (CornedQuantity) and then said:<br><br>&quot;1 CQ, that's easy, that's about 8 of those VeryCornedQuantity packs.<br><br>(For those outside the CC, there are four QuiteCornedQuantities to a CornedQuantity and two VeryCornedQuantities to a QuiteCornedQuantity.)&quot;<br><br>What have you learned from the remark that wasn't already in the first sentence? Only that there's yet another unit somewhere between CQ and VCQ.<br>Which is not helpful.<br><br>The &quot;most useless&quot; was harsh - nevertheless, it's a simple objective fact. (But then, I haven't seen the phrase often.)<br><br>So, my apologies if you feel slighted, but I stand by my core point. Which is in no way meant to devalue the comical or informational value of the post.<br><br>Oh, and Michael, where do you get the idea that I'm superior?</div>

And it has to be at least 2% milk too.  The reason its so hard is because the sphincter at the bottom of the stomach closes up if there is undigested fat in the stomach.<br><br>I've been present at three or four milk bet attempts and I can report that it is in fact humanly possible.  There's a guy named Andy on the search team who won the milk bet; he's a big guy.</div>

Then type &quot;convert 1 pound to $&quot; and result is &quot;1 British pound = 1.8127 US$&quot;.<br><br>Unfortunately Google won't convert 1 pounds to 1 gallon of milk, but the second result of a search for &quot;what is the weight of one gallon of water&quot; states &quot;1 gallon of water equals 8.33 lbs&quot;.<br><br>Assuming that one gallon of milk weighs the same as one gallon of water, a gallon of milk should cost &quot;1 gallon * 8.33 pounds/gallon * 1.81 $US / pound = (result from google) $15.07 in England.<br><br>Milk is much cheaper in the US.  I love google, haha.</div>

Friday afternoon, go figure.<br>PPS. That reminds me of something else to get on my way home...<br></div>
<p><a id="460532" href="#460532">#</a> <strong>David Jost</strong> on Saturday, September 03, 2005 11:38 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">This is funny.  I have tried to drink it twice, and one time stopped one cup away and the other threw up 2 cups away.  Needless to say, these are both amply more than half a gallon.  By stopped, by the way, I meant didn't throw up, but stopped willingly.  Point is, clearly my stomach can hold more than 1/2 a gallon and I can keep it there.  The other time I made some major mistakes, and the circumstances were rather bizzare.  By the way, my parents have to ration milk on me to a gallon every 3 days because I love it so much.  Anyway, I'm trying again today to drink a gallon in an hour and never throw it up.  Wish me luck!</div>

It doesn't matter what the conversion is at all... The guy said he easily drank a pint in a few minutes... Then to clarify he said there are 8 pints in a gallon, the unit of the bet. So it doesn't matter to anybody what what is, if you made up your own system all you would have to do is say how many of what you were drinking were in a gallon... Like if you say you drank 8 VeryCornedQuantity's, you'd just have to say 8 equals a gallon, and there'd be no confusion. That's just my take on it. <br><br>And to MichKap, I might be another anonymous person, but hey, take it how you will.</div>

Obviously, if you weight that much, your stomach is actually bigger than that, right?<br><br>I guess to be completely fair you would have to modify the bet so that it would be about twice your stomach capacity.... :-)</div>

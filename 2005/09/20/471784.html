<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Ok, hopefully people can read everything and it works in the various browsers. But with the continued intentional and unknowing help of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jledgard/archive/2005/09/12/464108.aspx">Josh</A> and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/heaths/archive/2005/09/12/463976.aspx">Heath</A> I have pretty much reached some kind of steady state.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>If you can't see the blog, be sure and say something (boy, if that doesn't sound like "if you're not here, raise your hand.").</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I experimented with keeping various sections open rather than collapible, but in the end I figured everyone would have different preferences anyway (I know I do!).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Hope this helps the many people who were having trouble with the 3-column view on smaller resolutions. :-)</FONT></P>

<p><a id="471798" href="#471798">#</a> <strong>Nicholas Allen</strong> on 20 Sep 2005 11:41 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Trying to untangle the convoluted css here...<br><br>It looks like the space is caused by the padding rules for #news in /Themes/Blogs/luxinterior/style/style.css.  Try overriding those in your private css file.</div>
<p><a id="471873" href="#471873">#</a> <strong>Joe Clark</strong> on 20 Sep 2005 2:03 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">How about something below 137 validation errors? How about something vaguely resembling Web standards?</div>
<p><a id="471885" href="#471885">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 20 Sep 2005 2:20 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Sorry Joe, I am neither the host nor the producer of the editing tools -- so most of them I have no control over. But anyone who feels so offended by this that they can no longer read my blog will in no way offend me. I can understand why this is a problem for some people, and respect the viewpoint.</div>
<p><a id="471930" href="#471930">#</a> <strong>Nicholas Allen</strong> on 20 Sep 2005 3:20 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">The addition<br><br>#news { margin: -1.5em -1em -1.5em -1em; }<br><br>to the css worked for me.</div>
<p><a id="471936" href="#471936">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 20 Sep 2005 3:29 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Nicholas -- it worked! Thak you very much!</div>
<p><a id="471955" href="#471955">#</a> <strong>Chris</strong> on 20 Sep 2005 3:51 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">It makes little difference through RSS!!</div>
<p><a id="471966" href="#471966">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 20 Sep 2005 4:11 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Chris, almost every change I did was for the site as a website. :-)</div>
<p><a id="473567" href="#473567">#</a> <strong>Joe Clark</strong> on 24 Sep 2005 7:58 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Whoever was saying they were so &quot;offended&quot; by your site's total lack of Web standards that they &quot;can no longer read&quot; it?</div>
<p><a id="473575" href="#473575">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 24 Sep 2005 9:34 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Hi Joe -- No, I am saying if people feel that way, I will respect that. Some people feel that strongly about the issue....</div>
<p><a id="473944" href="#473944">#</a> <strong>Joe Clark</strong> on 26 Sep 2005 9:10 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">The &quot;issue&quot; that &quot;people feel... strongly about&quot; is getting Microsoft Weblogs into standards compliance, the sort of thing teenage boys can manage on their own blogs.<br><br>Work on that first, visual design second.</div>
<p><a id="473975" href="#473975">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 26 Sep 2005 11:11 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Um, I do not work for the company that provides the blog software, so there is very little I can do THERE.<br><br>Perhaps you could go razz the provider rather than the consumer, Joe?</div>
<p><a id="481188" href="#481188">#</a> <strong>Joe Clark</strong> on 14 Oct 2005 2:53 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">You're the middleware and your customer has voiced a request. You go razz them.</div>
<p><a id="481233" href="#481233">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 14 Oct 2005 4:45 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Not my line of country, Joe. Sorry....<br><br>But as I said, if you are offended by my attitude then you may want to stop reading the blog? :-)</div>

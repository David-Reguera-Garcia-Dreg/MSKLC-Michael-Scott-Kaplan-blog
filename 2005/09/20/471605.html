<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The other day, someone sent me some mail with an interesting question:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman"><EM>Hi Micheal, was googling for an answer to this dev question "how do you detect the first day of the weekend and how many days there are in the weekend"</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman"><EM>Which is a good question. Cause GetLocaleInfo doesn't help there except to give you the first day of the week - but its not safe to assume the last two days are weekend days when your outside Europe etc.</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman"><EM>Any thoughts? Thought I'd ask you after reading your blog...</EM></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE></FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>My first thought was </FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>of Ursa Minor Beta, of which has been said:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><EM><FONT size=2>It is a West Zone planet which by an inexplicable and somewhat suspicious freak of topography consists almost entirely of sub- tropical coastline. By an equally suspicious freak of temporal relastatics, it is nearly always Saturday afternoon just before the beach bars close. </FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But then I realized that I was not being tested about my Douglas Adams knowledge. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>My second thought was that perhaps Microsoft should pay to send me to various exotic places to see if I can find anywhere that has longer than a two-day weekend every week!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Then, back on Planet Earth I realized I should just come clean.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>There is no locale data carried around by Windows that tracks the first day of the weekend, and there is nothing to represent the number of days in the weekend. As&nbsp;far as I know, every locale calls LOCALE_SDAYNAME6 and LOCALE_SDAYNAME7 the weekend, and it is always two days long.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Of course, given that LOCALE_IFIRSTDAYOFWEEK exists and that there are many locales that have different days that users would consider the "first day of the week", the whole term "weekend" is kind of unfortunate. And it does make me wonder if they even call it a weekend in every locale. And if it is not, then what happens to songs like <STRONG>Everybody's Working for the Weekend</STRONG> in those places? Or maybe Loverboy just didn't do as well in some locales....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Does anyone know better here? Is there some place that has a 3-day weekend every week, or somewhere that starts the weekend on Wednesday? I can fly there within the month. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

For example, many motorcycle mechanics have their weekends on Monday and Tuesday, leaving them free to work Saturday and Sunday.  Some places are closed Tuesdays and Thursdays, etc.  The concept of weekend is one probably put in with repeating holiday, rather than a true feature of the week.<br><br>Actually, it'd be interesting to see which cultures don't have a 7-day week, if they have a week at all.  It's very strongly Judeo-Christian.<br></div>

Prior to this time zone change, Kiribati straddled the date line; as a consequence, government offices on opposite sides of the line could only communicate on the four days of the week when both sides experienced weekdays simultaneously.&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br></div>

Every single week, not once in a while.<br>Since there are still communist countries in the world, this might still be the case.<br>I am not trying to say only communists work on Saturday, it might be the case in other parts of the world too. In fact, the story says that God rested one day, not two, after he created everything :-)<br><br>Ok MishKa, so maybe there is no country with three days of week-end, but you might find some with one, to go and visit :-)<br></div>

Most holidays are determined formulaically.  Independence Day is nominally easy, but different businesses have different policies if it falls on a Saturday or Sunday.<br><br>Easter is particularly interesting as it depends on the phases of the moon in the given year.  This requires a lunar ephemeris.</div>

It's very strongly Judeo-Christian. <br><br>Not at all. A week is 7-days in a lot of early civilisations pre-dating Christianity atleast, and having little to do with Judaism. For instance, ancient Babylonia and the Vedic civilisations.

For example, in Outlook you can select your working days in the Calendar preferences. <br><br>Perhaps configuration of the working week isn't useful to most Windows applications, so there's no reason to have it as a locale setting?</div>

<p>Muslim week (what would you call it? Even I don't know the proper term) starts on Friday which is also a weekend in most Muslim countries.</p>
<p>But this gives rise to another problem. In Pakistan weekend has shifted back and forth between Friday and Sunday at least half a dozen times. We even had two day long weekend in the 90s. This would make weekend 2.5 days long because of the half day on Friday and holidays on Saturday and Sunday.</p>
<p>So weekend are not fixed culturally or religiously, at least in my country. :(</p>

<p> In Israel, the days of rest are Saturday and either Friday or Sunday, at the option of the individual.</p>
<p> I think this sentence completely broke down my attempts to assign working/weekend days to cultures. I think the Outlook team did solve this brilliantly.</p>
<p> Mihai: I'm from one of these countries, and it really was not so long ago!</p>
<p> Yet still the first question by kfarmer interests me:</p>
<p> Does anybody know, whether there are any _present_ cultures which do not have 7 days in week? I've read that in ancient times practically all options between 4 and 8 days per week were used, but today?</p></div>

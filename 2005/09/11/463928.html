<h1>An odd place to draw the line</h1>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Robert Scoble has a nearly famous policy about comments on his blog -- he never deletes them. He lets people vent and rant and leak out whatever ectoplasm or vomit or whatever they are going to spew out on the comment page. And he does not delete them. Even if they are anonymous. Or maybe it is especially when they are anonymous?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Me? I am not nearly as tolerant as he is, as my comment policy indicates. It is not that I mind when people disagree with me -- that happens all the time. It is just that I prefer there to be a bit more dignity....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Anyway, apparently some bozo started posting comments in his name, which inspired a post&nbsp;that Robert did entitled <STRONG><A href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/09/11.html#a11113">Trolls go over the line</A>:</STRONG></FONT></P><FONT face=Tahoma>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><EM><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>The trolls are out of hand. Now they are impersonating me on my comments. I will delete any comments that are made in my name that aren't mine. Just gonna take me a while to do it cause they are over on Channel 9 doing the same thing. Ahh, the fun.</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>I won't delete any comment not made in my name, but doing it in my name is over the line, sorry.</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE></FONT>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It seemed like an interesting place to draw the line. Interesting, and maybe even a little bit odd.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I mean, if someone started posting as Robert (or anyone) on other blogs, that would seem to me to be pretty obnoxious. Would he ask the hosts of the other blogs to take action to remove the posts, especially if the person was choosing to be very offensive? This is hardly a theoretical point; as I mentioned in <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/08/28/457383.html">this</A>&nbsp;post I had to get such a comment removed&nbsp;from amazon.com when someone tried to fake a post from a former colleague of mine in PSS.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And more importantly (if his answer to <EM>that</EM> question is YES), if someone complains to him that some jerk is posting in <EM>their</EM> name on&nbsp;Robert's blog and asks him to remove the imposter's comments, would he?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Just trying to understand if the line is drawn in such a way to protect the integrity of&nbsp;Robert's blog, the integrity of Robert on his blog, of the integrity or Robert everywhere he hangs out (which was, at last count, approximately everywhere!)</FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>As I said, it seems like a really odd place to draw the line, given his previously stated policies. The notion of a policy that says "post anything you like here, as long as my name is not taken in vain here" has a real scent of something on it. Ego, perhaps? :-) Maybe the name "Robert Scoble" is rare enough that he is the only one, but such&nbsp;a claim smacks of ego, too. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It would not work for me since there are other Michael Kaplans in the world, some of whom actually&nbsp;send me mail from time to time....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Or will Robert recognize that the more attention he pays to the troll, the more interest&nbsp;he will generate in the dork's campaign?</FONT></P>

Heh, but then only a true geek would come up with a technical solution to a social problem :p~</div>

Why? Well, I need to protect my identity. Simple as that.<br><br>Now, is there another Robert Scoble in the world? Probably. But there isn't one that uses the email address of rscoble@microsoft.com.</div>
<p><a id="464275" href="#464275">#</a> <strong>Maurits</strong> on Monday, September 12, 2005 8:19 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Ah well.  I still think PGP is an impressive solution to the following problem:<br><br>Allow commenters to reliably tie their comments to their personal web site (and thus, their &quot;online identity&quot;)<br><br>Admittedly the PGP ASCII stuff looks ugly.  Hopefully someone will write a PGP-savvy blog software that will hide the line noise behind a &quot;verified w/ PGP&quot; icon...<br><br>But you must admit that if Mr. Scoble were able to easily PGP-sign all of his comments* (perhaps even by default) then the imposter's comments would have carried far less weight.<br><br>* and publish his public PGP key on his blog, of course</div>

I am sure they will appreciate it. :-)</div>

I mean, fair enough Robert wants to protect his identity.  But I also want to protect my identity as well.  What if someone posts trollish comments on Robert's blog with my name, would Robert delete those posts (at my request) even though that would seem to violate his &quot;do not delete posts&quot; policy?</div>
<p><a id="464307" href="#464307">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on Monday, September 12, 2005 10:18 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">I agree, Dean. That is a good question. It is one of the ones I asked! :-)</div>

I believe that all blogs should differentiate the author's or OP's comments from everyone elses with obvious difference in formatting. The authors ongoing comments should look like a continuation of the article, while everyone else's should be enclosed in a comment box, it makes for a much easier read, plus it wouldn't matter if someone used his name because it would be obvious they weren't him, and he wouldn't have to delete it.</div>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Ok, I am now about three weeks after my first <A href="http://www.novantrone.com/">Novantrone</A> dosage.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And I am feeling quite good!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I have some symptoms that used to come and go which seemed to have gone for the time being. I am cautiously optimistic about this, because it makes some sense -- if the symptom was coming and going then it was more likely due to active inflammation than to chronic, sclerotic plaques. And since Novantrone jams in there and takes no prisoners on immune response, I can understand why it might have some good impact here.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>With that said, not everything got suddenly better. So I have some symptoms that will either need more time with the Novantrone or more likely that are basically permanent for me. Which is a thought that could depress me if I decided to let it, but I'm not going to. After all, I am still getting around, and getting some things done. And there is not too much indication that I am in the final days....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But I wanted to thank all of you who have shown concern and support, it is very much appreciated. Truly. :-)</FONT></P>

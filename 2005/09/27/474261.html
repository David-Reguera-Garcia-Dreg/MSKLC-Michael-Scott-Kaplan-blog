<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I used to hear a story from a colleague about an Admin who would talk about how someone with status was a <STRONG>Very "V.I.P." person</STRONG> (from the description she was someone who you could tell was putting the quotes there, even if she was speaking).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>This is obviously silly since V.I.P. stands for <STRONG>Very Important Person</STRONG>. It simply makes no sense to talk about a very very important person person!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Anyway, tonight I went to see Ari Bixhorn and Richard Turner talk about Indigo. It was a cool talk and even came with a T-shirt I might wear at some point due to the cool logo image thingy:</FONT></P>
<P align=center><IMG height=193 src="http://trigeminal.fmsinc.com/images/INDIGO.JPG" width=332></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Of course they explained how it was not called Indigo anymore; it was actually called W.C.F., or <STRONG>Windows Communication Foundation</STRONG>. they were unable to repress the shudder that I am sure we all felt.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Which is of (in my opinion) the worst product name for a cool code name since Internet Studio became Visual Interdev. But I'll talk about code names some time soon. I do like Ari's thought that the cooler the code name, the worse the product name -- this could henceforth be codified as <STRONG>Bixhorn's Law</STRONG>, if no one had yet stated it for the record....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The problem, however, was that toward the of the talk, they said (and what was said was on the slide), in true Mickey Blue Eyes </FONT><FONT face=Arial><STRONG>The La Trattoria</STRONG> style:</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=6><STRONG>WCF Foundation</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Now obviously there is a language phenomenon where acronyms like <STRONG>RADAR</STRONG>, <STRONG>LASER</STRONG>, and <STRONG>SONAR</STRONG> become words to many people who do not even know what they stand for, or even if they stand for anything. </FONT><FONT face=Arial>In computers it happens with <STRONG>BIOS</STRONG>, <STRONG>NT</STRONG>, and <STRONG>DOS</STRONG> and a million other terms just as readily. I have heard people say Light Amplified LASER and BIOS system and not shuddered more than momentarily.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>But <STRONG>WCF Foundation</STRONG>?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>That awful name for what looks to be the coolest thing since sliced bread (or more accurately, the coolest thing since the delivery service that can get the sliced bread delivered in the distributed environment!) is in no way mature enlough tp have lost its acronym status!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Anyway, I am taking the day off for my birthday, though I may end with a post or two here that may or may not be technical. In the meantime, do your best to remember what silly acronyms stand for so you can correct those from the camp of <STRONG>The La Trattoria</STRONG>, if you know what I mean! :-)</FONT></P>

Putting the &quot;foundation&quot; after it gives it more cognitive meaning. They could have called it &quot;WC Foundation&quot;, but then you might still wonder what &quot;WCF&quot; is.<br><br>I think we're just going to end up with the acronym WxF, the way we got VxD, ActiveX, and DirectX.</div>

Such things usually take far longer to become &quot;words&quot;, if they ever do.</div>

FAT is a filesystem characterized by its allocation tables.  A FAT table would refer to one of those tables, as distinct from a table for some other system.  (similarly for &quot;NT Technology,&quot; even if the T actually did stand for &quot;technology.&quot;)<br><br>Nachos con queso, sadly, isn't redundant either.  I've ordered nachos and gotten pretty much everything *except* cheese.  Disappointing.</div>

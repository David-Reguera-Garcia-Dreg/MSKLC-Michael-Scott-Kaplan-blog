<h1>How to turn off the CAPS LOCK key</h1>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Earlier today, I talked about the fact that <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/09/21/471982.html">some people hate the CAPS LOCK key</A>. Well, Jeff D. posted the steps to <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/09/21/471982.html#472366">turn&nbsp;the CAPS LOCK&nbsp;off</A>&nbsp;in Windows XP and Server 2003, and I thought that I would repost them so that others who are not looking at the comments would benefit:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><EM>The other solution I've used is to simply change the cancellation of CAPS LOCK to be done with the Shift key instead. sO THAT i CAN'T ACCIDENTALLY DO THIS. </EM></FONT></FONT></P>

<LI><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><EM>On that page "Add" a second input language (you don't have to make it the default). The two (or more) I usually have installed are "English (Canada) - US" and "English (United States) - US". Once you've got more than one input language installed, the "Key Settings..." button becomes enabled: click it. That opens the "Advanced Key Settings" dialog. Right at the top you'll see: </EM></FONT></FONT></LI>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><EM>Voila! Now if you have accidentally hit the CAPS LOCK key, as soon as you start typing the next sentence, which presumably starts with a capital letter, you'll cancel the CAPS LOCK immediately. </EM></FONT></P></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

If the shift key turns off the caps lock, then you can't get any keys that require the shift. That makes it so that legitimate purposes for the caps lock are made more frustrating. A few examples would include coding &lt;HTML&gt; (if you prefer to code HTML in caps), bulleting that ends or starts with a &quot;:&quot;, or quoting in caps.<br><br>I hate to be a jerk about it, but honestly if you're hitting the caps key on accident that much, you should be more careful with your typing. Nobody expects the world to remove the &quot;q&quot; key because it happens to stand in the way of the pinky hitting the &quot;1.&quot; Granted, it was perhaps given an overly prominent place on the keyboard, but I don't think software hacks are a good way to cover it up.</div>

<p>My sysadmin is also a basterd. Whta you can also put under the capslock key is a small row of staples so the capslock cannot be pressed in completely. Its a lowtech fix but it works for me. We do not have the clearance to install our own software...</p>
<p>good luck.</p></div>

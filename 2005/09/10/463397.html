<P><FONT face=Tahoma>If I had a dollar for every time someone said the exact words that form the title of this post, I would be able to rival the annual salary I paid myself as Chief Software Architect of my software company before I became a serf at Microsoft. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>As Cathy Wissink first told me a long time ago, NLS&nbsp;may be best thought of as an acronym for <STRONG>N</STRONG>ot <STRONG>L</STRONG>ocalization, <STRONG>S</STRONG>tupid. Which is not to call localization stupid, it's not. In fact, as I&nbsp;implied <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/09/09/462862.html">yesterday</A> and <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/09/08/462765.html">the day before</A>, localization really depends on good support from what is covered by NLS, and could thus be thought os as a proper subset in any software that is not itself stupidly implemented to international markets.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The term <EM>stupid</EM> in that recasting of the acronyn is meant to refer to the people who think that what I do is localization. Though in polite <A href="http://tenser.typepad.com/tenser_said_the_tensor/2005/08/kyoto_to_tokyo.html">Kyoto to Tokyo</A> form, I usually tell the person who made the mistake that NLS stands for <STRONG>N</STRONG>ot <STRONG>L</STRONG>ocalization, <STRONG>S</STRONG>illy. It is just more polite....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Also to&nbsp;alter the aside from&nbsp;TStT:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=+0><FONT face=Tahoma>[Aside: This anecdote is sort of, but not exactly, an instance of what Mark Liberman calls </FONT><A href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002399.html"><FONT face=Tahoma>"silly talk about linguistics"</FONT></A></FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>.&nbsp; It doesn't really qualify, though, because the misconception (a) was really about localization, not internationalization or NLS in general, and (b) was brought up not because I mentioned I work in NLS, but rather because in this case they claimed to have read my blog when pretty obviously they could not have read any part of it.]</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Speaking of the&nbsp;RHDL Emeritus again for a moment (Kieran claims that I have caused <A href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Cathy+Wissink%22">Cathy's Google hits</A> to expand voluminously though a quick look seems to disprove that notion), when she and I write articles she usually has to translate&nbsp;the <EM>Michaelisms</EM> into English, so perhaps&nbsp;Cathy <EM>is</EM> in fact a localizer in that context? :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And that reminds me, speaking of articles, we have one in the <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/05/10/default.aspx">October 2005 MSDN</A>&nbsp;(the one I referred to <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/08/22/454839.html">last month</A>), which will be available online in a few days. She struggled to localize this one back to English in addition to all of the work to provide actual content. I wonder if she pines for the days before I was a serf when we actually got paid for that sort of thing? :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Maybe that is a better answer for the silly NLS question:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#ff0000><EM>woman on plane</EM>: You work for Microsoft, what to do you?<BR><EM>me</EM>: I work in NLS.<BR><EM>woman on plane</EM>: NLS, what is that?<BR><EM>me</EM>: Well, basically the international support. So people can use their language (or really any language) in Windows.<BR><EM>woman on plane</EM>: NLS, that is wonderful! How many languages do you speak?<BR><EM>me</EM>: Only one. But I have a colleague who is really patient about it, and she translates for me.</FONT></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Kind of passive/aggressive, but no worse than when I used to respond to "<EM>Jewish? Where are your horns?</EM>" type questions as a teenager travelling through West Virginia with "<EM>I'm don't wear them when I travel.</EM>"</FONT></P>

Or more likely, they might think that those are languages.<br><br>Much the way computer novices think that somebody who uses keyboard shortcuts must be a computer expert, it's pretty easy to assume that you must know some language because you know intricate details of its sort order. Hell, I once had an old Russian lady convinced that I was a native speaker because I was able to use all six words of the Russian vocabulary I know appropriately in conversation (with an accent I learned from movies).</div>
<p><a id="463449" href="#463449">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 10 Sep 2005 4:45 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">A fair point, Gabe -- and it is odd to think sometimes about how I am an expert on a mechanism that supports things about which I am merely an egg (or a neophyte, to the less geekily inclined!).</div>
<p><a id="463515" href="#463515">#</a> <strong>J. Daniel Smith</strong> on 11 Sep 2005 12:22 AM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Some of this depends on exactly how you define &quot;speak&quot;.  In the context of this question it doesn't literally mean &quot;speaking&quot; but probalby a more general &quot;know&quot; (speak and/or read and/or write and/or listen).<br><br>You might rate your knowledge of particular language as less than others would say.<br><br>And you must admit that you do have at least a casual acquaintance with a number of languages -- perhaps even enough to read &quot;USA Today&quot;-style (i.e., simple) headlines from around the world.<br><br>Even if reading headlines or counting to 10 doesn't count a speaking/knowing a language to you, the average English-speaking american might be pretty impressed.</div>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I doubt <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/craigrow/archive/2005/09/14/466199.aspx">Craigrow is the first one to say it either</A>, but I am sure he will not be the last. But what is the point of <A href="http://blogsearch.google.com/">Google's Blog Search</A>?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Though it looks like <A href="http://slashdot.org/">/.</A> is having a <A href="http://slashdot.org/articles/05/09/14/125202.shtml?tid=217&amp;tid=95&amp;tid=1">great time</A> with the idea. Thought I have to admit the funniest comment I saw came from <A href="http://slashdot.org/~hyperstation">hyperstation</A>, who <A href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=162203&amp;cid=13557090">said</A>:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P>it's like indexing a litter box, turd by turd. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Which probably says more about the blogsophere than Google's attempt to index it! There are a lot of people writing blogs who should instead spend more time reading them. If you know what I mean. If you don't, then I do plan to blog about this one day, I just have not quite gotten to it yet....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Of course, the Google blogging index is not all there yet. So their effort is actually more like trying to index a litter box, turd by turd, and missing most of them.</FONT></P>

Despite the fact that all venders claim to have excellent search technology, I often have to look at 100s of pages using search before I get the information I want.  With blogs, this will be much much worse to the point where search just doesn't work.  There should be ways to make it work though..<br><br>For example, I could use heuristics to find the experts on any given subject in a given community.  I could then look at which pages they commonly look at, comment etc, to see who they feel are experts in the same material.  I figure out weighting criteria to determine additional experts and then refine my set.  Note that the word Index is missing from this.  Looking for words on a page is highly unlikely to get me to the right people instead, I am looking at web traffic patterns.<br><br>Eventually, I might be able to do type in localization and get &quot;Sorting it all out&quot; and then some of your friends web pages afterwards.  If I was looking for a particular portion of localization like Windows Vista Localization, the search would again analyze traffic patterns, find the &quot;Windows Vista Localization&quot; experts and then find which subset of their pages deal with the specific topic weighting them by page hits or comments.  <br><br>Now, this would be useful.<br></div>

<p><a id="466303" href="#466303">#</a> <strong>Scott Pedersen</strong> on 14 Sep 2005 2:33 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">I don't believe Google is creating a blog search because it is very useful in of itself, but rather to improve their more conventional web search.  Creating a blog search may provide Google with some knowledge and expertise that will help them reduce blog's overwhelming influence on PageRank and thus reduce their susceptibility to Google bombing.  <br><br>Having some sort of search service with blog in the name probably also serves some marketing purposes regardless of its technical merit.</div>

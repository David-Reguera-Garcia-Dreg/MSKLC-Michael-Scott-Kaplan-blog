<P><FONT face=Tahoma>No, it is not me, I am back in Redmond still....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But as <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/drintl/">Dr. International</A>&nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/drintl/archive/2005/09/13/465246.aspx">mentions</A>, Edward Ye is in the Fundamentals area in the Track Lounges thoughout this week. They did not give him a booth or a poster, but he is definitely there.&nbsp;If you are at the PDC you may want to look him up; if you do that then be sure to let him know who sent you!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Also, whether you are at the PDC or not, you should leave a comment on Dr. Interntional's blog about the fact that there should be more posting there. There is a huge wealth of knowledge about making applications "world ready" that they have naught to do but tap into in order to be able to put out dozens or maybe even hundreds of posts. Let's put the pressure on, everybody! :-)</FONT></P>

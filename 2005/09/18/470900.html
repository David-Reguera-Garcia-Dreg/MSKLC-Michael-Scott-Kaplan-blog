<h1>A shorter 'shortest published sentence of the year' ?</h1>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>A little while ago, Geoffrey K. Pullum sent up to the <A href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/">Language Log</A> a post entitled <A href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002480.html">Shortest published sentence of the year</A>.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>And I do agree that the sentence in question:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=6><EM>Z.</EM></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>is indeed a very short one.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>But it got me thinking.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>There were all&nbsp;those old IBM manuals that would start new sections by being sure to print on a page that would allow you to take a section out without robbing the previous or the next section of their pages.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Now that is a very noble and sensible goal for manuals that are published in three ring binders obviously intending to facillitate such practices, but that would mean that on a regular basis there would be&nbsp;blank pages.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Of course if you look at technical material, a blank page is a little scary -- perhaps it did not get printed, and important material is lost. So they would helpfully print somewhere on the page the following witty text:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P>(This page left intentionally blank.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Of course the irony of the situation is inescapable (they made the page decidedly non-blank by printing the sentence, after all). It certainly has a shakier basis than the explanation of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/07/22/54559.aspx">why you have to click the Start button to shut down</A>.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Perhaps there is a construct that could be used that would allow&nbsp;what is printed to fulfill its purpose&nbsp;without giving lie to its own claim. The current state of affairs is simply far too Godelian!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>So it got me thinking....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>In the spirit of a Hofstadterian self-referential sentence, I could say:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>The next sentence is left intentionally blank. .</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>In case you wish to object about the setup required for it to be in any way sensible, I would counter that "Z." needed even more of a setup than the one proceeding sentence....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Makes for&nbsp;a smaller sentence, no? :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#ff1493><EM>This post brought to you by</EM> "ï¼Ž"<EM> (<A href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/ff0e/index.htm">U+ff0e</A>, a.k.a. FULLWIDTH FULL STOP)<BR><FONT size=1>(a character that would perhaps not be a part of the shortest sentence of the year if its halfwidth cousin was also printed somewhere)</FONT></EM></FONT></FONT></P>

(I wish I could give credit to the author, but I've forgotten.) You have to work up to it gradually, starting with the two-line limerick:<br><br>There once was a man from Peru,<br>Whose limericks would end with line two.<br><br>Next comes the one-line limerick:<br><br>There once was a man from Verdun.<br><br>Finally, the no-line limerick, which is about a man from Nepal:<br><br></div>

But it <EM>is</EM> an interest in distraction, if nothing else.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Personally, I prefer Helevetica. But I freely admit that I may or may not be able to tell the difference between them in any given circumstance, which would indicate that possibly I'm deciding it based on the name or some other irrelevant distinction....</FONT></P>

Wow =) If you're looking for the ultimate developer fonts I recommend <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.proggyfonts.com/">http://www.proggyfonts.com/</a>. I use ProggyCleanTT@12pt for all of my editors and the 'co' versions for my various Win32 console windows.<br><br>I also use them on my two Linux boxes (ouch) for vim editing, as well as on the GNOME/bash console (which accepts proportional fonts).</div>

Any coder will tell you verdana is a HORRIBLE font to use as it's not monospaced and I'm pretty sure it doesn't crossout it's zeros.  I find Lucinda Console to be a good programming font.<br></div>

Apple didn't ship PostScript fonts -- Adobe did. Apple's fonts were named after cities: Chicago for the system font, Geneva for the Swiss (i.e. sans-serif Helvetica-like) font, Monaco for the mono-spaced font, etc. When Apple shipped TrueType, they also shipped TT versions of Chicago, Geneva, etc.<br><br>So when an Apple user wanted a font that looked good on the screen, they would choose Geneva because Helvetica only looked good at a few sizes (unless they had ATM). And even if you had ATM, PS Type 1 fonts didn't have the hinting options to make them look as nice on-screen as TrueType could. For some reason Macs (possibly due to PostScript) could not properly kern Geneva when printing it out (some letters squished together, others had large gaps between them), so you would have to use Helvetica when printing.<br><br>Either Microsoft or Monotype knew what they were doing, though, because Arial looks good both on the screen and on the printer. Perhaps it is the Bud Lite of fonts, but it looks fine no matter what hardware or software you use. The same could not be said of Helvetica. Who wants to use a font that only looks good when printed on a PostScript printer?</div>

I didn't know that TrueType came about because Adobe wouldn't release the Type 1 format, nor that so many exact Helvetica clones existed.<br><br>Anyway, Helvetica and Arial are both horrible fonts, born out of the demented aesthetics of the 1960s and fit only for station signs, but Arial is (by a small margin) the more horrible of the two. The best that can be said about them is that they're better than Comic Sans. </div>
<p><a id="471969" href="#471969">#</a> <strong>Rosyna</strong> on 20 Sep 2005 4:14 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Saying they're better than Comic Sans isn't saying much. If I had to choose between two fonts I hated, I would choose Helvetica any day. The kerning on Arial sucks horribly.</div>

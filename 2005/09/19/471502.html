<P><EM><FONT face="Times New Roman">Hi</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT face="Times New Roman">Thanks for the article. I'm thinking if could you build the MFC and CRT dlls against Unicows and distribute this built version ?</FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE></FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Well, several issues here.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>1) If you are <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2004/12/07/277204.html">Rebuilding the CRT and MFC for Unicode on Win9x</A>, on any version, you are using the information provided by someone who is not me -- as the articles state. I am just hosting the content, but I am not the author. :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>2) I am not a lawyer.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>3) My vague understanding of the rules of rebuilding MFC and the CRT are that you can use this for your own applications but that you cannot give it to other developers to use and redistribute as producers of applications. Thre restrictions here apply whether you use unicows.dll or not. I could be totally wrong about the first part but I am not wrong about the second (but I am also no substitute for an actual lawyer here).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>4) I have tried on several occasions to get the MFC/CRT folks to either grant an exception to the rules here (and I would just host the files) or even build MFC/CRT binaries with MSLU themselves. It has been refused each time, especially given how little time there is left where Win9x is considered a supported platform.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It would have been nice if it had been allowed, but it was not. Sorry. :-(</FONT></P>

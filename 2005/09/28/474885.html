<h1>People notice when the sorting doesn't work</h1>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Bill Poser was talking about <A href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002499.html">Multilingual Google</A> earlier, and I noted an interesting bit toward the bottom:</FONT></P><FONT face=Tahoma>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><EM><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>Using Google in another language is a fun way to try out a language you don't know real well. It's easy to switch to a language you do know well if you get stuck and it isn't all that complicated. </FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>I do have one small complaint (beyond the fact that they don't yet have all of my favorite languages), which is that they are evidently sorting the list of languages the same way no matter what language they are in, in the order of the Unicode codepoints. This yields unexpected results. </FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>For example, on the Catalan list Arabic comes last, after Zulu, because the Catalan word for Arabic is Àrab and the À, whose Unicode codepoint is 0x00C0, follows all of the ASCII letters. Z is 0x005A. If Google really wanted to do things right, they would sort the names using the appropriate collating rules for each language. </FONT></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE></FONT>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>This does indeed seem a little unfortunate to me. I know how hard I worked to get the language list on trigeminal.com to be sorted according the chosen UI language&nbsp;(as we all know, <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/08/23/455359.html">browsers only have one language setting</A>, so like everyone else I overloaded!).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Of course that may be wrong too if one knows what the user locale is, and the setting is different from the UI language. But both are preferable to Unicode code point order!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I will talk more about this particular user expectations topic soon -- it is an interesting one to me. :-)</FONT></P>

It seems pretty well-thought-out from reading the RFC.  And browsers support it:<br><br><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.geocities.com/mvaneerde/ie-lang.jpg">http://www.geocities.com/mvaneerde/ie-lang.jpg</a><br><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.geocities.com/mvaneerde/firefox-lang.jpg">http://www.geocities.com/mvaneerde/firefox-lang.jpg</a><br><br>And changing the settings does correctly modify the Accept-Language header, even to the q= factor:<br><br>Firefox:<br>default -- Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5<br>modified -- Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.8,af;q=0.5,ar-iq;q=0.3<br><br>Internet Explorer:<br>default -- Accept-Language: en-us<br>modified -- Accept-Language: en-us,af;q=0.7,ar-iq;q=0.3<br><br>If there was one thing I could wish for, it would be a way to configure the browser to have per-site language preferences.  I suppose that would be an IE8 feature request... along with per-site javascript preferences, per-site ActiveX preferences, per-site cookie preferences etc. etc. etc...<br><br>See Firefox per-site cookie policy:<br><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.geocities.com/mvaneerde/firefox-cookies-perdomain.jpg">http://www.geocities.com/mvaneerde/firefox-cookies-perdomain.jpg</a></div>

<p><a id="475082" href="#475082">#</a> <strong>John Bates</strong> on 28 Sep 2005 6:07 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">The trigeminal.com site is a great example to show bosses how proper i18n support can work.<br><br>BTW, a minor bug: the UK English page (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://trigeminal.com/index.asp?2057">http://trigeminal.com/index.asp?2057</a>) shows two &quot;English - United Kingdom&quot; instead of one plus a English - US.</div>
<p><a id="475162" href="#475162">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 28 Sep 2005 9:53 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Thanks, John. Very kind words....<br><br>It is one of the big reasons behind having the site up there (I also wrote up some of the tehniques in an MSDN Magazine article).<br><br>And I fixed that bug with the name. Good catch. :-)</div>

Maybe an example would be useful.<br><br>Re: trigeminal.com...<br><br>FYI, the &lt;nobr&gt; tags in the language selection box throw Firefox 1.5b1 for a loop.  Haven't checked Firefox 1.07.</div>
<p><a id="475342" href="#475342">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 29 Sep 2005 12:11 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Did you read the original post I had on this? The problem is that there are many possible language settings one might need, and they all get overloaded into this one:<br><br>* the user locale<br>* the user UI language<br>* the content<br><br>thus something using &quot;fa&quot; for Farsi might be something using Farsi formatting for dates, something in the Farsi language, or something about Fasrsi written in some other language entirely.<br><br>I know what it is supposed to be; the fact that people use it for any of these is indication enough of the need for another setting....</div>
<p><a id="475343" href="#475343">#</a> <strong>Michael S. Kaplan</strong> on 29 Sep 2005 12:12 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Ok, as for the Firefox bug --<br><br>It is a valid tag. I thought Firefox was 100% standards compliant? :-)</div>
<p><a id="475392" href="#475392">#</a> <strong>Maurits [MSFT]</strong> on 29 Sep 2005 2:14 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">&lt;nobr&gt; is not a standard tag - It's a Microsoft extension, like &lt;marquee&gt;<br><br><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/author/dhtml/reference/objects/nobr.asp">http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/author/dhtml/reference/objects/nobr.asp</a><br>&quot;This object is an extension to HTML&quot;<br><br>The W3's validator doesn't catch this at first because you don't include a doctype...<br><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.trigeminal.com%2F">http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.trigeminal.com%2F</a><br><br>But if you manually specify HTML 4.01 Transitional via the DOCTYPE dropdown, it reports &quot;element nobr undefined&quot;<br><br>Still no excuse for Firefox.  If Firefox can't handle the &lt;nobr&gt; Microsoft-ism, Firefox should ignore the &lt;nobr&gt; tags altogether.</div>
<p><a id="475397" href="#475397">#</a> <strong>Maurits [MSFT]</strong> on 29 Sep 2005 2:28 PM:</p><div style="margin-left: 1em">Yes I read your original post.  I just don't fully understand the distinction you're making.<br><br>The browser's UI locale should not be betrayed to the server, that's a privacy violation.<br><br>If the user wants to see a web page in Farsi, Accept-Language is appropriate, no?<br><br>If you make a distinction between the language of the &quot;web page UI&quot;, and the language of the &quot;web page content&quot;, then there are many ways to do this... but are there any compelling use cases for this?  If so, what?<br><br>If so, then further development of the HTTP language settings may be appropriate.  Or perhaps it would be more appropriate to simply enhance the usability of the browser's Language settings.<br><br>For example, instead of digging through Internet Options, how about a drop-down box of preferential languages on the IE status bar?  This should show the names of the languages in the user's UI locale, not in the language of the web page.</div>

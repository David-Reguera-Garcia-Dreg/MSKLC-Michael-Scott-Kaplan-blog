<P><FONT face=Tahoma><a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/04/26/412398.html">Back in the end of April</A> I talked a little about the Hijri calendar, and <a href="http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2005/04/03/404931.html">back in the beginning of April</A> I posted some more.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>In that last post I talked about the date advance functionality in Regional and Language Options that lets small alterations to the beginning of the month depending on when the moon was spotted, and mentioned that there were plenty of places where the algorithm is supported but the ability to make the changes is not. For example VB/VBA/COM, and also SQL Server.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I was thinking about all of this the other day when I saw <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mohamed_sharafs_blog/archive/2005/09/23/HijriDateswithSQL.aspx">this post</A> in Mohamed Sharaf's blog. He was pointing out the best way to treat Hijri dates as dates, and to sort them appropriately. It does deal well with the SQL Server limitations that do not allow dates with years prior to 1753 by assisting with the conversion of the Hijri dates to Gregorian dates.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Now this does not help with the limitation of the date advance setting not being present, but since that setting would only correctly apply to the current month, it is hard to really know how one would apply it. Mohamed's post does deal well with the solvable portion of the limitations in SQL Server related to Hijri dates....</FONT></P>
